      "Twelve years ago, a vicious tailed beast known as the Nine-Tails attacked the shinobi village of Konohagakure. Many shinobi fought the beast but killed all those standing before it. The Fourth Hokage saved the town by sealing the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.\n",

      "In the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto cannot perform basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.\n",
      "\n",
      "After successfully stealing the scroll, instructor Iruka Umino finds Naruto, who realised that Mizuki had tricked Naruto. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining since the day he was born, Nine-Tails that had been sealed inside him that the reason the villagers hate him so much. He explains that Iruka must hate him the most because the Nine-tails was the one who killed his parents. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions and that he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.\n",

      "Amazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his forehead protector. He says that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.   \n",

Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto cannot perform basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.\\n\\nAfter successfully stealing the scroll, instructor Iruka Umino finds Naruto, who realised that Mizuki had tricked Naruto. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining since the day he was born, Nine-Tails that had been sealed inside him that the reason the villagers hate him so much. He explains that Iruka must hate him the most because the Nine-tails was the one who killed his parents. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions and that he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.\\n\\nAmazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his forehead protector.

However, Ino comes over and states that she should be the one to sit next to Sasuke before many of the other girls do the same thing. Upset over the attention Sasuke is getting from the girls, Naruto gets on top of the desk and glares at Sasuke, with the latter returning the favour. Suddenly, Tobio accidentally bumps into Naruto, causing him to fall forward and kiss Sasuke, much to the girls' dismay. As a result, Naruto gets pummelled by them, because they were angry that they weren't Sasuke's first kiss.\\n\\nAfter Iruka arrives, he explains the next step that the genin will take, explaining that they will be in a team of three led by a jōnin. He then announces that Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke will be Team 7; Hinata, Kiba and Shino will be Team 8; and Ino, Shikamaru and Chōji will be Team 10. Naruto abruptly asks Iruka why he had to be on a team with Sasuke before being told that he had the worst scores of all the graduates, while Sasuke had the best, so in turn, they were put together to create a balanced group.\\n\\nDuring lunchtime, Sakura tries to find to Sasuke to ask him to have lunch with her to no avail. She then runs into Naruto who asks her to have lunch with him, but she coldly dismisses him. Angered yet again, Naruto ambushes Sasuke through an open window.

Naruto then transforms into Sasuke and heads out to find Sakura. When he finds her, he asks her what she thought of Naruto. She replies by saying that he was annoying. Sakura then leans in to kiss Sasuke, but as they are about to kiss, Sasuke is forced to go to the bathroom. \\n\\nWhen the real Sasuke manages to escape, he runs into Sakura and asks if she's seen Naruto. Brushing off what he asked, she proceeds to mock him, believing that he's so annoying because he had no parents to teach him how to behave and that he was all alone. This sparks Sasuke to remark that Sakura had no idea what it felt like to be alone before saying that she was annoying. This causes Sakura to have some resolve for Naruto, deciding to be nicer to him.\\n\\nAfter Naruto finishes using the bathroom, he runs into Sasuke, much to his surprise.

Kakashi then tells them that they will undergo a survival test tomorrow morning, which will determine which of 27 graduates will be sent to the Academy, with the chances of failing being 66%. Before dismissing them, he also tells them to skip breakfast or else they\\'d puke.\\n\\nAt 5am the next day, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura arrive at the designated area as instructed.

Kakashi then tells them that they will have to retrieve a bell from him by noon, and since there are only two, one of them will be not only fail but will be tied to a tree post and watch as everyone else eats.

Kakashi further explains that team-work was the key in retrieving a bell. Kakashi notes that each of them were so self-entitled throughout the challenge: Naruto recklessly tried to face a foe who clearly outmatched him alone without even a real plan, Sakura focused all her interest on Sasuke while making no effort to help Naruto when she was to do so, and Sasuke arrogantly believed his team-mates weren\\'t worth his time and acted as such.

Naruto expresses that he wants to go on a real mission that\\'s exciting and challenging.

The Third goes on to explain that with a higher-ranked mission comes higher difficulty and greater risk to the shinobi.

Amused at his statement, the Third decides to give the team a C-rank mission to escort Tazuna, a master bridge builder, to the Land of Waves. When Tazuna meets the team, he expresses disbelief in the fact that kids are going to be guarding him but works with them nonetheless. \\n\\nAs they make their way to the Land of Waves, two chūnin-level Kiri-nin emerge from a puddle and binds Kakashi with shuriken-laced chains, before pulling and ripping him apart.

Before anything further can happen, Kakashi appears and effortlessly defeats the duo, though Naruto does attain a small scratch from one of their Metal Gauntlets, which contained poison. It is revealed that Kakashi used the Body Replacement Technique to escape the duo\\'s initial attack, suspecting an ambush when he discovered their puddle on a clear day. Kakashi compliments Sasuke and Sakura for their courage but expresses disappointment in Naruto with how poorly he handled the situation. Tazuna questions why Kakashi took so long to help, with the latter explaining that he could have defeated them quickly but needed to know who their target was. Kakashi points out that their target was Tazuna and that had he told them that he would be hunted by ninja, the mission would be a B-rank or higher, and a different team would have been assigned. Sakura suggests they quit the mission, not only due to the higher difficulty but because of Naruto\\'s wound. Unwilling to jeopardise the mission, Naruto decides to take out a kunai and uses it to remove the poison from his hand. He then makes an oath that he will never run away or back down from any mission, threat, or enemy, as well as not lose to Sasuke. After this, Kakashi bandages Naruto\\'s wound so he doesn\\'t bleed out, but discovers that it had already begun to heal due to the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.  \\n\\nElsewhere, Gatō, the man who hired the Demon Brothers to eliminate Tazuna, complains about their failure to Zabuza, the duo\\'s apparent boss. Zabuza raises his Kubikiribōchō at Gatō to shut him up, and states that he will handle it himself.

Wishing his student a fond farewell, the Third dies after reciting one last proverb. At this time Naruto and Gaara leap at each other, and Naruto succeeds in delivering the winning blow.\\n\"},\n",

One morning, he had asked Itachi to help him with his shuriken training, only for Itachi to brush him off. Sasuke then asked his father how come Itachi never had time for him. His father told Sasuke that Itachi was very closed off and distant, and that not even he knew his own son very well.

He then tells her that he will be using her very own pawns against her, but Tayuya does not seem to care. Shikamaru tells her to at least arm herself, and she tells him that her flute is her only weapon. Shikamaru and her creatures charge at Tayuya, but Tayuya is able to dispel her creatures. Shikamaru voices his frustration, causing Tayuya to laugh at him for thinking he had a chance. However, just as she attempts to kill him, she finds herself trapped by Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. He tells her that, just like in a game of shōgi, the first move is always a fakeout, whereas the second move is the final strike.\\n\\nTrapped and unable to move, Tayuya advanced her cursed seal to its second state in order to use the strength and chakra it provides to break free of Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. Shikamaru attempts to hold her in place with the advanced Shadow–Neck Binding Technique, which seems to work; however, while her body is kept bound by his jutsu, her fingers are free to move, and she uses her flute to place Shikamaru within a genjutsu. As the genjutsu causes Shikamaru to scream in pain, Tayuya picks up one of Shikamaru's kunai knives and rushes towards him to kill him. Just as she gets close, Shikamaru punches her in the gut. Wondering how he ever got out of her genjutsu, she notices that he had manipulated his shadow to break his own finger, and used the pain to break out of her genjutsu. Shikamaru then uses his Shadow-Neck Binding Technique on her again, telling her that the closer he is to his target, the tighter the bind his jutsu inflicts. As Tayuya berates herself for her carelessness, Shikamaru reveals that it was all according to his plan - once Tayuya revealed that her flute was her only weapon, he knew that once she thought she caught him, she would need to arm herself to kill him, and that she would pick up that kunai closest to her and come near him to finish him off. \\n\"},\n",

Gaara uses his sand to fight Kimimaro, which prompts Kimimaro to attempt to destroy Gaara's gourd, as he believes it is the only source of sand Gaara possesses.

The clan's patriarch used him as a weapon in an attempt to take down Kirigakure.

He then transforms his right hand into a bone drill in an attempt to bore through Gaara and kill him.
