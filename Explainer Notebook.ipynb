An edge exists between two nodes if the characters have appeared together in an episode. The edge weights of the graphs indicate the number of co-occurrences of the mentioned characters up to the episode on which the network is built. These networks are cumulative, meaning that the network of episode 'n' corresponds to the characters' co-occurrence data from episode 1 up to episode 'n'.

    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Weight Subjectivity:** The assignment of edge\n",
    "weights based on character co-occurrences introduces a\n",
    "level of subjectivity. While we experimented with different\n",
    "levels of thresholds, and concluded that a threshold level\n",
    "of 100 delivered the clearest visilibility of the, the choice\n",
    "of a threshold (e.g., 100) may impact the interpretation \n",
    "of character significance, and alternative threshold values\n",
    "could lead to different network structures. Striking a balance\n",
    "between inclusivity and focus is challenging and requires\n",
    "careful consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community Detection Sensitivity:** Community detection algorithms, while powerful, are sensitive to parameter\n",
    "settings. The Louvain algorithm employed in this analysis\n",
    "may produce different results with variations in resolution\n",
    "parameters, potentially influencing community assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute-Based Partitioning Challenges:** The manual partitioning of the network based on character attributes,\n",
    "such as village affiliation, introduces its own set of challenges.\n",
    "Ambiguities in character allegiance or the lack of observation\n",
    "of latent variables may affect the accuracy of the partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis Complexity:** The sentiment analysis captures the emotional tone of both the characters and\n",
    "the episodes. However, the inherent complexity of language\n",
    "and context limits the granularity of sentiment scores and\n",
    "their respective interpretation, both on the character level,\n",
    "and but also on the episode level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Edge Weight Thresholding:** Future research\n",
    "could explore dynamic edge weight thresholds that adapt\n",
    "to the evolving narrative of the series. This approach\n",
    "may provide a more nuanced understanding of character\n",
    "significance over different story arcs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Sensitivity Analysis:** Conducting a sensitivity analysis on community detection algorithms, including parameter variations, could enhance the robustness\n",
    "of partitioning results. Exploring alternative algorithms\n",
    "may provide additional insights into community structures.\n",
    "Furthermore, other advanced clustering algorithms on vector\n",
    "representations of the nodes and their respective attributes\n",
    "can be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute-Based Partitioning Refinement:** Improving the accuracy of attribute-based partitioning involves refining character attribute annotations and considering additional\n",
    "attributes such as character roles or power levels. This could\n",
    "lead to more accurate community assignments. With help\n",
    "of statistical learning algorithms, the most important node\n",
    "attributes can be detected and explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning Sentiment Analysis:** Developing a more\n",
    "sophisticated sentiment analysis model that considers context\n",
    "and character relationships may yield richer insights into the\n",
    "emotional dynamics of the series. This could involve natural\n",

    "networks for sequential data or other statistical learning\n",
    "algorithms for NLP can be employed to predict more accurate\n",
