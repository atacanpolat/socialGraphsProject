Despite this, the village was slow to rebuild following the defeat of Akatsuki in the War as well as the deaths of Konan and Nagato. Even the damage from Jiraiya's battle with the Six Paths of Pain hadn't been repaired in the decades following the War, and the cityscape was mostly abandoned by the time of Naruto's reign as Hokage. As such, it was used by Kara, which maintained a secret research facility in it for a while before abandoning it.

In addition, the positive outlook to the village made it a well-known tourist destination.[14] While the large majority of citizens are happy with the brimming liveliness of their new transformed and cheerful village,[15] there was still a small minority that was both very distrusting and hateful towards outsiders. Viewing this friendly, peaceful infrastructure as an insult to their pride as ninja, this minority openly longed for the old days of the \"Blood Mist Village\". Despite the village's progress to move to a brighter future, the Fourth Mizukage's dark legacy was never forgiven, as many villagers continued to despise him to the point of mistreating his descendants. When the Funato clan rose up against the Land of Water for its modernisation, they nearly went to war with Kirigakure. However, with the assistance of Boruto Uzumaki, they managed to quell the war before it began, and Kiri came to realise that they have progressed too rapidly without approval from the populace, and agreed to slow down.\n", "Hoshigakure": "The underground hideout of Natsuhi and Hotarubi was situated outside the village, within the nearby forests.

Because it is such a remote village, the villagers received aid from the Lightning Group in the past. When the Lightning Group came into conflict with Kirigakure, its surviving members sought refuge in Bamboo Village. The villagers refused to help them, fearing reprisal from Kiri. Years later, this rejection of the Lightning Group causes Bamboo Village to be attacked by the Dark Thunder Group, but the village is saved by Sasuke Uchiha.\n", "Konohagakure": "Konoha has a protocol in case the village is ever under attack.[23]\n", "Tsuchigumo_Village": "They later appeared as a mind-controlled horde, used by the Magaki group against Sakura, Sai, Yamato, Naruto and Utakata.

As a result, he went to research on creating Akuta, artificial soldiers who would supplant the shinobi to protect the weak. However, due to the sudden disobedience of these creatures during the demonstration, along with such attempts to build a private army being in transgression of the agreements of the Union, the Fourth Tsuchikage banned any further developments. Nevertheless, the Third would continue his work in secret, creating Fabrications to serve as commanders for his Akuta army. However, \u014cnoki's plans went awry when the Fabrications gained their own free will from their desire to live longer than their fragile artificial lives would allow, which led to their revolt against the village by placing it under lock-down while trying to sacrifice five villagers to transplant their human hearts into themselves. With the help of Konohagakure's Teams 7 and 10, the Fabrications were defeated and the Akuta army were destroyed, although \u014cnoki died while fighting the last Fabrication. Although Iwagakure, the Five Kage and the small amount of Konohagakure teams knew of the truth, the rest of the world were given a cover story that \u014cnoki died from ill-health during a dissenter attack on the village that was suppressed by Kurotsuchi.\n", "Kumogakure": "However, tensions did arise shortly after the attack of Momoshiki and Kinshiki \u014ctsutsuki; Iwagakure was ordered by their Daimy\u014d, Danj\u014d, to invade and conquer the Land of Flowers, whom Kumogakure are obligated to protect due to their alliance.
