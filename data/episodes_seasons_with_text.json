Many shinobi fought the beast but killed all those standing before it. The Fourth Hokage saved the town by sealing the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.\n\nIn the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto cannot perform basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.\n\nAfter successfully stealing the scroll, instructor Iruka Umino finds Naruto, who realised that Mizuki had tricked Naruto. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining since the day he was born, Nine-Tails that had been sealed inside him that the reason the villagers hate him so much. He explains that Iruka must hate him the most because the Nine-tails was the one who killed his parents. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions and that he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.\n\nAmazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his forehead protector. He says that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.   \n"}, {"Episode Number": "2", "Episode Title": "My_Name_is_Konohamaru!", "Japanese Airdate": "10 October 2002", "episode synopsis text": "Naruto takes a bizarre photo to use for his Ninja Registration Form, causing the Third Hokage to order him to retake it.

Konohamaru chastises Naruto, believing that since he's the grandson of the Third Hokage, Naruto wouldn't harm him. However, Naruto replies that he doesn't care and punches the boy.\n\nAfter Naruto leaves, Ebisu, Konohamaru's trainer, informs the boy not to let Naruto bother him, as he is beneath him. He carries on to say that if he wished to quickly be the next Hokage, he needs to stick by him. However, during his speech, Konohamaru left to follow Naruto without him noticing. Ebisu panics and rushes off to find him. \n\nWhile walking through Konohagakure, Naruto is followed by Konohamaru who tries to avoid being spotted. However, Naruto realises this, seeing through Konohamaru's disguises. Impressed by this, Konohamaru orders Naruto to train him. While seeming uninterested at first, after Konohamaru refers to Naruto as \"boss\", he accepts. After training, Konohamaru explains to Naruto that the reason he wants to be the next Hokage was so that people can see him as more than just the grandson of the Third Hokage.\n\nElsewhere, on the rooftop of the Hokage's office, the Third is seen looking up at the Fourth Hokage's monument. After Iruka appears and explains how Naruto believes that becoming a genin will change things, the Third explains that people don't change easily. The Third goes on to say that due to Naruto containing the Nine-Tailed Fox within himself, people fear the beast could take over or that Naruto may be the beast. \n\nEbisu finally finds Konohamaru and Naruto. Ebisu tells Konohamaru to come with him, but Konohamaru refuses. After announcing that he is learning how to beat his grandfather in order to become Hokage, Konohamaru performs the Sexy Technique. Worried that Konohamaru is becoming a delinquent due to Naruto, Ebisu tries to pull Konohamaru away with him. However, Naruto tries to stop him by using the Shadow Clone Technique to battle Ebisu. As Ebisu prepares himself, he is surprised when Naruto and his clones use the Sexy Technique, causing the latter to have a huge nose bleed and fall unconscious.

Sakura spots Sasuke sitting down and runs over to him, knocking down Naruto in the process, and asks if she could sit next to him. However, Ino comes over and states that she should be the one to sit next to Sasuke before many of the other girls do the same thing. Upset over the attention Sasuke is getting from the girls, Naruto gets on top of the desk and glares at Sasuke, with the latter returning the favour. Suddenly, Tobio accidentally bumps into Naruto, causing him to fall forward and kiss Sasuke, much to the girls' dismay. As a result, Naruto gets pummelled by them, because they were angry that they weren't Sasuke's first kiss.\n\nAfter Iruka arrives, he explains the next step that the genin will take, explaining that they will be in a team of three led by a j\u014dnin. He then announces that Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke will be Team 7; Hinata, Kiba and Shino will be Team 8; and Ino, Shikamaru and Ch\u014dji will be Team 10. Naruto abruptly asks Iruka why he had to be on a team with Sasuke before being told that he had the worst scores of all the graduates, while Sasuke had the best, so in turn, they were put together to create a balanced group.\n\nDuring lunchtime, Sakura tries to find to Sasuke to ask him to have lunch with her to no avail. She then runs into Naruto who asks her to have lunch with him, but she coldly dismisses him. Angered yet again, Naruto ambushes Sasuke through an open window. The ending results shows Sasuke standing over a gagged and bound Naruto, but is later revealed that Sasuke only defeated a substitution before the real Naruto overpowers him with the Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto then transforms into Sasuke and heads out to find Sakura. When he finds her, he asks her what she thought of Naruto. She replies by saying that he was annoying. Sakura then leans in to kiss Sasuke, but as they are about to kiss, Sasuke is forced to go to the bathroom. \n\nWhen the real Sasuke manages to escape, he runs into Sakura and asks if she's seen Naruto. Brushing off what he asked, she proceeds to mock him, believing that he's so annoying because he had no parents to teach him how to behave and that he was all alone. This sparks Sasuke to remark that Sakura had no idea what it felt like to be alone before saying that she was annoying. This causes Sakura to have some resolve for Naruto, deciding to be nicer to him.\n\nAfter Naruto finishes using the bathroom, he runs into Sasuke, much to his surprise. Naruto uses the Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to attack Sasuke, but is unable to proceed due to having to use the bathroom again. After finishing, he spots Sakura who is strangely being nice to him. This leads him to believe that it was Sasuke transformed as her, and is prepared to face off against her until he has to use the bathroom yet again.\n\nAt Naruto's house, the Third Hokage briefs Kakashi on the team he will be leading, Team 7. Kakashi examines a carton of milk and states that it was spoiled, which is the reason Naruto had to run to the bathroom so much.

Sasuke points out that an elite ninja will never fall for something like that, but to his surprise, he does, amusing Naruto and secretly Sakura as well. This action causes Kakashi to ridicule them by calling them \"idiots\", much to their dismay.\n\nKakashi has the team introduce themselves: Naruto says that he wants to be Hokage one day, Sakura merely blushes and glances at Sasuke, and Sasuke declares that his goal is to kill a certain someone. Kakashi then tells them that they will undergo a survival test tomorrow morning, which will determine which of 27 graduates will be sent to the Academy, with the chances of failing being 66%. Before dismissing them, he also tells them to skip breakfast or else they'd puke.\n\nAt 5am the next day, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura arrive at the designated area as instructed. However, once again, Kakashi arrives late, upsetting them. Kakashi claims that a black cat passed his way so he had to go the long way. Kakashi then tells them that they will have to retrieve a bell from him by noon, and since there are only two, one of them will be not only fail but will be tied to a tree post and watch as everyone else eats. Sakura deduces that Kakashi made them skip breakfast to make the test more difficult. Once the test begins, the three of them go off and hide. \n\nElsewhere, Iruka discusses with the Third Hokage about his concerns of Kakashi and the training his former students will endure after hearing rumours. The Third understands and gives Iruka a book detailing the trainees who have passed and failed under Kakashi's wing. To Iruka's surprise, none of them have passed.\n\nBack at the training ground, just as Kakashi comments that his team has hidden well, Naruto makes his presence known and charges at him. Kakashi nonchalantly takes out his Icha Icha book and evades all of Naruto's attacks, before appearing behind him and using the One Thousand Years of Death to send him flying into the water. Naruto returns uses the Shadow Clone Technique to cleverly distract Kakashi as he had one sneak up behind him. To Naruto's surprise, as he prepares to a punch on the restrained Kakashi, Kakashi confuses Naruto having him think he turned himself into Naruto's clone. This caused the clones to attack one another, but in actuality, Kakashi used the Body Flicker Technique to switch one of Naruto's clones with himself. After Naruto disperses his clones, he spots a bell on the ground and joyfully picks it up, but it turned out to be a trap as Naruto is hung upside down by a rope attached to a tree. Kakashi appears and lectures him.

After blowing his position, Sasuke moves out to avoid being found by Kakashi. A worried Sakura runs off to find Sasuke, only to be caught by Kakashi's genjutsu that made her believe she found a very injured Sasuke. This caused her to scream and faint. Once confronted by Kakashi, Sasuke forces Kakashi to stop reading Icha Icha and use both hands to defend against his string of taijutsu attacks. Sasuke then launches a giant fireball at Kakashi. The j\u014dnin manages to avoid it by burring underground, before dragging Sasuke down, leaving only his head to be seen.\n\nNaruto manages to free himself from the tree he was hanging from and spots the food for lunch. Before he can try to snag a bite, Kakashi appears and ties him to a tree post. Elsewhere, Sakura wakes up and goes to look for Sasuke, whom she still believed was injured. She finds him buried from the neck down and comes to the conclusion that he was decapitated, before fainting again. Sasuke manages to free himself and is there to see Sakura awaken, who is relieved to see he is unharmed. Despite time running out, Sasuke is still set on getting a bell, informing Sakura that he came close to doing so. Knowing that she couldn't get a bell and didn't want to be separated from Sasuke, Sakura tries to convince him to give up and try next year. Sasuke dismisses the idea, explaining that he is an avenger and doesn't need any setbacks. Before they know it, time is up. \n\nAfterwards, Kakashi meets with the three genin, who tells them that he won't be sending them back to the Academy. The three share in the happy news until Kakashi goes on to say that they will be dropped from being a ninja permanently. Naruto is outraged at this and asks him why. Kakashi explains that they don't think like ninja, thinking more like \"little kids\". Sasuke charges at Kakashi, but is easily restrained. Kakashi further explains that team-work was the key in retrieving a bell. Kakashi notes that each of them were so self-entitled throughout the challenge: Naruto recklessly tried to face a foe who clearly outmatched him alone without even a real plan, Sakura focused all her interest on Sasuke while making no effort to help Naruto when she was to do so, and Sasuke arrogantly believed his team-mates weren't worth his time and acted as such. After showing them Konoha's Memorial Stone, Kakashi decides to give them another chance. Kakashi tells Sasuke and Sakura to eat and replenish their energy. However, since Naruto broke the rules and tried to eat before the test was complete, he is forced to watch. Furthermore, if either of them feed Naruto, they will immediately fail. \n\nAfter Kakashi leaves, Sasuke and Sakura begin eating their food, while Naruto's stomach growls of hunger. Sasuke decides to share his food with Naruto, stating that they'd need to retrieve the bells as a team and need everyone at good strength. Sakura hesitates, but decides to share her food as well. Kakashi suddenly appears and tells them that they will be punished for not following orders. However, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura band together to state that they are a team, and to their surprise, are rewarded with Kakashi stating they have passed.

With their mission successfully completed, the Third Hokage informs them of the available D-rank missions, such as babysitting the chief counsellor's three-year-old. Naruto expresses that he wants to go on a real mission that's exciting and challenging. Iruka lectures him, stating that like every beginner genin with no experience, he must start with simpler missions to develop his skills. The Third goes on to explain that with a higher-ranked mission comes higher difficulty and greater risk to the shinobi. However, Naruto exclaims that he is a ninja now and wants to be treated as such. Amused at his statement, the Third decides to give the team a C-rank mission to escort Tazuna, a master bridge builder, to the Land of Waves. When Tazuna meets the team, he expresses disbelief in the fact that kids are going to be guarding him but works with them nonetheless. \n\nAs they make their way to the Land of Waves, two ch\u016bnin-level Kiri-nin emerge from a puddle and binds Kakashi with shuriken-laced chains, before pulling and ripping him apart. With Kakashi \"defeated\", the duo turns their attention to Naruto, who freezes up. Before they can land an attack, Sasuke intervenes and saves Naruto. The duo split up, leaving one behind as the other charges at Tazuna. Sakura steps in front of Tazuna to defend him before Sasuke appears in front of her to aid. Before anything further can happen, Kakashi appears and effortlessly defeats the duo, though Naruto does attain a small scratch from one of their Metal Gauntlets, which contained poison. It is revealed that Kakashi used the Body Replacement Technique to escape the duo's initial attack, suspecting an ambush when he discovered their puddle on a clear day. Kakashi compliments Sasuke and Sakura for their courage but expresses disappointment in Naruto with how poorly he handled the situation. Tazuna questions why Kakashi took so long to help, with the latter explaining that he could have defeated them quickly but needed to know who their target was. Kakashi points out that their target was Tazuna and that had he told them that he would be hunted by ninja, the mission would be a B-rank or higher, and a different team would have been assigned. Sakura suggests they quit the mission, not only due to the higher difficulty but because of Naruto's wound.

Haku asks Naruto to kill him, as he\u2019s no longer useful to Zabuza, calling himself nothing more than a broken tool. He goes on to explain his past; being born in a small village, and how his parents dearly loved him. However during that time, anyone with a kekkei genkai, a bloodline trait, was feared. When Haku was a small boy, he discovered the powers inherited from his mother. Unfortunately, his father witnessed this, and murdered her out of shame. Just as Haku's father was about to kill him too, Haku subconsciously activated his trait, ending his father\u2019s life. A little while after that day, Zabuza found Haku, taking him in and training him in the most advanced ninja skills.\n\nKakashi finally uses the scroll he pulled out earlier to use Summoning: Earth Release: Tracking Fang Technique. Though Kakashi can't see or hear Zabuza, he would smell him out instead with these tracking dogs. Earlier, Kakashi let himself be sliced by Zabuza's blade, covering it in blood.

Back at the village, Tsunami tells Inari that he is too young to fight, but he is determined to defend his village. His demeanour reminds Tsunami of Kaiza, which surprises her. Inari leaves to go protect the bridge but finds a crowd waiting for him outside. As Zabuza's mist clears, Naruto is stunned to find Haku killed by Kakashi's attack. Zabuza is unfazed by his partner's sacrifice and swings his sword to slice through Kakashi and Haku at the same time.

Over the next three days, Naruto practices by himself in the woods as Jiraiya entertains himself with the women in town.

Naruto's Rasengan and Sasuke's Chidori clash, though neither is capable of overpowering the other, and they both are sent back flying.

The boys fight, and Sasuke struggles to counter Naruto's increased speed and strength. After a severe beating, Naruto pins Sasuke against the rock wall and asks him if he has come to senses yet. Sasuke tells Naruto that he could not possibly understand what it feels like to lose his whole family, because Naruto was alone from the very beginning. \n\nNaruto admits that whereas he knows nothing about parents or siblings, he thinks of Iruka as a father, and he wonders if his relationship with Sasuke is similar to having a brother. Naruto states that to protect this bond, he will stop Sasuke no matter what. Sasuke resists Naruto's appeals and says that it is too late for him to go back. He puts on his forehead protector and calls for Naruto to come, saying that he will break the bonds of their friendship. A third tomoe appears in Sasuke's Sharingan signifying that it is now fully mature. Naruto asks Sasuke why he's bothering with the forehead protector if he seeks to break his bond with Naruto and the rest of Konohagakure. Sasuke explains that he recognises Naruto as an equal, though he once again taunts that Naruto won't even be able to scratch his forehead. Elsewhere, Kakashi catches up to Pakkun and the two hurry to stop Sasuke and Naruto. \n\nNaruto and Sasuke resume their battle, but this time Sasuke has the upper hand, harnessing the full power of the Sharingan.

Sasuke laughs and says that Naruto has given him no choice but to use the second level of his cursed seal.

When the dust settles, Naruto is shocked to see a giant wing coming out of Sasuke's back, which has deflected his attack. Sasuke extends the wing and sends Naruto shooting towards the opposite side of the river.\n\nA second wing tears through the back of Sasuke's shirt, and he groans in pain. He remembers Sakon's warning not to use the fully released Cursed Seal for too long. Knowing that his body will erode if kept in this state, Sasuke tells himself he hasn't any time to waste. Naruto stands, his left hand completely immobile. He realises the Nine-Tailed Fox form is taking a toll on his body, which Sasuke happily notices as well.\n\nSasuke tells Naruto that they are fighting in the Valley of the End and that it is the perfect stage for their battle. A series of flashbacks recap the two boys' relationship up to this point: the formation of Team 7; Sasuke's superior abilities; Naruto's incredible improvement; Sasuke's subsequent jealousy; and eventually their inevitable fight on the rooftop. \n\nSasuke envisions Itachi's distorted Sharingan, which drives him to form Chidori a third time. Naruto straightens up and forms a Demon Fox Rasengan using only his right hand as his left hand is still out of commission. The strength of Sasuke's Chidori increases, becoming a Flapping Chidori. Deciding it is time to put an end to the fight and their history together, both ninja charge at each other with their ultimate techniques. They collide in an explosion of blue and red chakra that forms a swirling black sphere of energy. At the last moment, Sasuke chooses to punch Naruto in the chest rather than impale him with the Chidori. Likewise, Naruto only scratches Sasuke's forehead protector, disproving the boy's earlier taunt and minimising the effects of the Rasengan. Getting closer, Kakashi senses the massive chakra and tells Pakkun to hurry. \n\nNaruto and Sasuke are left hovering within the sphere, gazing sadly at each other. A vision of a younger Sasuke and Naruto shows the two form a seal as a symbol of friendship, and they smile at each other. The bright light then slowly dissipates and as it fades away, Naruto is shown lying on the ground, unconscious with Sasuke standing above him, revealing that Sasuke has emerged as the victor in their fight. Sun light breaks through the clouds, illuminating the two boys, and focuses to a point on Naruto's face before it disappears altogether. Sasuke stares down at Naruto while Sasuke's own scratched forehead protector loosens and falls to the ground, presumably confirming that Sasuke has severed ties with Konoha. It begins to rain. Sasuke is wracked by a sharp pain in his arm and falls to his hands and knees looking Naruto straight in the face.\n\nA while later, Kakashi arrives at the scene, but Sasuke is nowhere to be found. Kakashi slowly picks up the fallen Naruto, apologises for not making it in time, and acknowledges what must have been Naruto's desperate effort to save his friend. Sasuke walks through the forest assailed by memories of his parents and brother. He again recalls Itachi's last words to him, that to unlock his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan he must kill his closest friend. Back at the waterfall, Pakkun and Kakashi discuss the irony of Naruto and Sasuke fighting at the Valley of the End and the never-ending battles of the ninja world which like the river will go on forever. Naruto slowly opens his eyes, revealing Sasuke's choice to leave without killing him. Returning to Sasuke in the forest, the boy asserts that he will not do as his brother bids, and that he will obtain power in his own way. Sasuke then walks into the darkness. \n\nThe rain stops, and Kakashi and Pakkun head for home, Kakashi carrying Naruto on his back.

Kakashi decides to use taijutsu to deal with the clones; however, after there are only three clones remaining, Kakashi opens the First Gate and uses the Front Lotus on the three Naruto shadow clones, both Naruto and Sakura recognising the technique as one Rock Lee uses. After the three shadow clones are taken care of, Kakashi wonders where the real one is, only for the real Naruto to announce his presence and come barrelling at Kakashi with the intent of using One Thousand Years of Death. Kakashi, horrified at the mere thought of being struck by that technique, evades the attack and retreats. \n\nAs Naruto and Sakura continue to head through the woods to find Kakashi, they are stopped in their tracks by an injured Sasuke. Struck with kunai in his body, Sasuke tells Naruto and Sakura that he managed to escape from Orochimaru and asks the pair to help him. Sakura, however, instantly recognises the trick as a genjutsu and dispels it, while at the same time pinpointing Kakashi's true location. Naruto then creates a shadow clone to prepare his Rasengan, and uses Rasengan on the tree that Kakashi is hiding behind. Kakashi manages to dodge the Rasengan, and ponders on a time when it was easier to fool Sakura with a genjutsu. Naruto claims that he would never fall for any of Kakashi's old tricks, only to spot the bells on the floor. Exclaiming that Kakashi must have dropped them while dodging, Naruto rushes towards them before Sakura can stop him. Naruto is ensnared by a rope before he can get the bells, prompting Kakashi to state that Naruto still falls for the same old tricks. However, the Naruto trapped by the rope turns out to be a shadow clone while the real Naruto, claiming an old trick like that would not work on him, rushes from behind and punches Kakashi right in the face, only for the latter to use a Body Replacement Technique and retreat once more.\n\nBack in Suna, Deidara believes his infiltration of the village to be successful only to be stopped by Gaara, who claims that this is as far as Deidara gets.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "4", "Episode Title": "The_Jinch\u016briki_of_the_Sand", "Japanese Airdate": "1 March 2007", "episode synopsis text": "Deidara, riding on his large bird clay, decides to attack Gaara from a distance.

Chiyo explains that for the Akatsuki to use such a technique would mean that they have already begun the extraction. When Sakura asks what she means, Chiyo explains that the tailed beasts were often harnessed for their power by sealing them inside individuals. Those individuals would become host to the beast itself and would be able to keep the beast sealed within them while using the beast's power for themselves.

A councilman, however, states that Gaara being gone is perhaps best for the village, since most of the village is fearful that the One-Tail Shukaku spirit within Gaara will be unleashed upon them. The council men decide that electing a new Kazekage would bring much needed stability to the village. Kankur\u014d protests, but he is told that once before, the Third Kazekage, the strongest Kazekage Suna ever had, was also kidnapped. Suna had sent many recovery teams to locate him, but they could not even locate his corpse. To make matters worse, neighbouring nations attacked their village when it became known that the Kazekage was no more.

Sasori believes that he should be praised as well, since it was his two subordinates that were used as sacrifice for the leader's technique. The leader claims that it his technique that did the trick and that his two subordinates should be thankful for the opportunity to serve the Akatsuki, albeit a very brief opportunity. The leader then asks for a status report from Itachi. Itachi states that the Konoha shinobi were none another than Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno and the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto Uzumaki, along with Suna shinobi Lady Chiyo.

Chiyo and Kakashi come to the same conclusion as well. Naruto's anger and frustration causes him to slightly tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing his whiskers to become more prominent, changing his eyes from blue to red and increasing his stamina. Chiyo asks Kakashi why Naruto is so keen on rescuing Gaara when they're not even from the same village. Kakashi explains that Naruto is also a jinch\u016briki, that he harbors the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Fox within him. Kakashi tells her that since all jinch\u016briki are treated the same no matter what village they're raised in, Naruto understands the pain Gaara suffered through, and therefore he wishes to save Gaara from any more pain and suffering. Chiyo is surprised at this, and tells Kakashi that at her old age, she thought she knew how the world worked. She believed people only looked out of themselves and that alliances with neighbouring lands were nothing more than a farce. Wanting only to do what was best for Sunagakure, Chiyo tells Kakashi that it was she, with the permission of the Fourth Kazekage, who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Despite being an old woman, she believes that perhaps there is still something she could do for the good of the village.\n\nMeanwhile, the Akatsuki finish sealing Shukaku inside of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The extraction kills Gaara, who in his last moments contemplates on the nature of his existence. Deidara states that the entire process took three days. Gaara's dead body falls the floor, and Deidara and Sasori prepare to deal with the intruders headed their way. Outside of the hideout, Team Guy arrive. Lee decides to break their way in, but Guy notices the barrier seal. At the same time, Team Kakashi arrive.

He explains that there are four other tags in the vicinity and that all five tags must be ripped off at the same time to deactivate the barrier. Using his Byakugan, Neji locates all the other tags, and using wireless headsets, Team Guy sets off to find the four barrier seals. Meanwhile, most of the Akatsuki members end their astral projection technique and leave the hideout. Deidara and Sasori, who are the only members to be physically present, are ordered by the Akatsuki leader to dispose of the intruders. However, he tells them that the Nine-Tails' Jinch\u016briki is to be captured alive. Although Naruto's capture was a task personally assigned to Itachi, Sasori is now given that responsibility.

Kakashi decides to use his Sharingan against Deidara since the latter managed to defeat Gaara, who was a Kage. Deidara finds Naruto's behaviour odd, stating that with the exception of Gaara, they have killed two Jinch\u016briki before, and that no one came to their rescue; he adds that most people were actually glad to be rid of them. He understands that Naruto must have some desire to save another of his kind, but finds the notion pathetic.\n\nBack inside the Akatsuki hideout, Chiyo explains that the Sasori they see in front of them is not Sasori's actual body, but in fact a puppet named Hiruko. Sakura wonders where Sasori is, as she does not see someone behind Hiruko pulling his strings, and is shocked to learn that Sasori is operating Hiruko from within. Chiyo explains that since puppet masters are not good at close combat and rely on their puppets to attack, this leaves the puppeteers themselves vulnerable, hence why Sasori created Hiruko, to counteract that weakness. Chiyo reveals that Sasori was once a master puppeteer in Sunagakure, but at some point began to transform human corpses into human puppets, which Sasori considered a form of art. The puppet they see in front of them, Hiruko, is actually the body of a shinobi from a neighbouring village whose corpse Sasori used. Chiyo tells Sakura that she joined the Kazekage Rescue Team believing she could stop Sasori, as she knew how Hiruko operated, but reveals that Sasori has improved and refined the puppet. Nonetheless, they believe they have the advantage and Chiyo shares a secret with Sakura, which Sasori is unable to hear.\n\nFinally ready to start their battle, Chiyo and Sakura rush at Sasori/Hiruko. Sasori uses Prepared Puppet: Eight Waves of Needles, which causes poison-laced senbon to rapidly fire out of Hiruko's mouth. Both Chiyo and Sakura are able to dodge every single senbon. Sasori resorts to releasing Hiruko's arm and launching it as a projectile, which releases even more poison-laced senbon. Once more, Chiyo and Sakura are able to avoid every single one of them, to Sasori's disbelief. While he is able to understand Chiyo's masterful dodging, as she is an expert puppeteer herself, he is unable to comprehend how Sakura was able to do so as well. While Chiyo stands idly, Sakura rushes towards Hiruko. Sasori attempts to jab her using Hiruko's poison-tipped tail but his attack is blocked by Chiyo, leaving Hiruko vulnerable. Using her Chakra Enhanced Strength, Sakura lands a massive blow on Hiruko, destroying the human puppet. Sasori manages to get out of the rubble, but keeps his face covered.

Kankur\u014d tells Temari to take a break, which Temari protests, until Kankur\u014d points out the members of her team are exhausted and unable to continue. Although Temari is able to persuade them to push themselves past their limits in order to save their Kazekage, Ebiz\u014d tells the others to take notice of where they have stopped. Looking around, the team realise that they are standing on the same battlefield where Team Kakashi fought Itachi. Ebiz\u014d claims that since they are in Akatsuki territory, blindly rushing in, and to do so exhausted, would result in swift and sudden annihilation. While the team decides to rest, Ebiz\u014d tells them the tale of the strongest ninja in Sunagakure's history, the Third Kazekage, and how one day he was mysteriously kidnapped. He tells the Suna ninja that the village searched for him for years, with the Anbu even searching in secret. However, they were unable to find his corpse or even how he was kidnapped. Ebiz\u014d states that during the time that Suna searched for the Third Kazekage, the village entered into a state of panic that allowed enemy ninja from a rival village to invade Suna and cause a war. Believing that such bloodshed could have been avoided had Suna dealt with the crisis in a calm fashion, Ebiz\u014d tells the team not to repeat Suna's mistakes from the days of the Third Kazekage.\n\nBack in the Akatsuki hideout, Sasori uses Hiruko's head to launch another round of poison-tipped senbon, only for Sakura to dodge them all once more. However, this time he realises that it is Chiyo who is pulling the strings, using Sakura as her own human puppet. He then summons a new puppet to battle with, revealed to be none other than the Third Kazekage. Chiyo realises that it is Sasori who kidnapped and killed the Third around a decade ago, and is appalled to learn that he transformed the Third into a human puppet. While she finds his association with Akatsuki regrettable, she finds his betrayal to his village the most despicable, holding him responsible for the murders of the last three Kazekage - the Third, the fourth, and Gaara, the Fifth, despite Orochimaru killing the Fourth. Sasori claims that it was one of his spies that was complicit in the murder of the Fourth, but admits that the Akatsuki and Orochimaru have some shared history.

Not wanting to drag out their fight, as he needs to aid Deidara outside capture Naruto, Sasori uses the Third Kazekage puppet to launch more poison senbon towards Sakura; Chiyo manages to have Sakura evade the attack successfully. Using the Third Kazekage's poison blades, Sasori tries to stab Sakura, but the attack is blocked by Hiruko's tail, which Chiyo controls with her chakra threads. However, the blades are powerful enough to break Hiruko's already powerful tail. Having no other method to protect Sakura, Chiyo is unable to block Sasori's Thousand Hands Manipulation Force.

She remarks that everything she has done for Suna her whole life has been wrong, and that resurrecting Gaara is the only thing she has done right.\n\nGaara's spirit returns to his body, as he sees himself as a younger child crying all alone. However, he is surprised when he sees and feels a young Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him. As he opens his eyes, he is shocked to find himself in the real world with Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him, the latter glad to see Gaara once more. Gaara notices that nearly every member of Suna's military are also there, all of them cheering and crying out of happiness. Kankur\u014d thanks Naruto for saving Gaara, but Naruto tells him to thank Chiyo, who he believes simply passed out from resurrecting Gaara. Kankur\u014d, however, explains to him and everyone else that Chiyo is dead, having given up her life in exchange for Gaara's. Temari tells Naruto that he really does have the power to change people, adding that Chiyo would have never given up her life to revive a Kazekage or a jinch\u016briki until she met Naruto; Kakashi adds that she died passing on the future to Naruto and Gaara. Sakura cries, and Chiyo's brother Ebiz\u014d notes how peaceful she looks and how he half-expects her to start laughing (as a callback to when she used to fake her death near him as a joke). Naruto remarks that she died in a selfless matter similar to the Third Hokage, and Gaara, managing to stand up on his feet, calls for a prayer to commemorate Chiyo's actions and bid her farewell.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "32", "Episode Title": "Return_of_the_Kazekage", "Japanese Airdate": "25 October 2007", "episode synopsis text": "Deidara pops out of a hole in the ground, having used a Suicide Bombing Clone in his attempt to kill Teams Kakashi and Guy. Although he believed the technique would have done the trick, he is grateful that he was able to survive due to the attack. Having only lost his right arm from the elbow down, he decides to search for its remains, as well as the Akatsuki ring that was on its finger.\n\nBack at the Akatsuki hideout, Zetsu arrives to scope out the aftermath of Sasori's battle, with his subordinate Tobi in tow. Zetsu finds Sasori's body and notes that he had never known how Sasori looked like before. Tobi manages to locate Sasori's Akatsuki ring, and asks if he can keep it and use it to fill the now empty spot in Akatsuki's ranks. Zetsu berates him for acting foolish, and Tobi responds in kind by accidentally dropping the ring into a crevice in the ground. \n\nIn Sunagakure, all of its citizens, including Baki, eagerly await by the border for the return of their Kazekage. They are overjoyed when they spot the Three Sand Siblings, Konoha's response team and Suna's own rescue unit. The citizens of Suna cheerfully celebrate the successful recovery of their leader. Gaara decides to let Chiyo's corpse be carried into the village first, as a sign of respect. As Gaara resumes office, Baki and Temari attempt to persuade Naruto and the others to stay in the village for a day or two, in order to recover and recuperate from their wounds. Kakashi and Sakura tell them that they must return and report to Tsunade regarding the completion of their mission. A report is sent in advance by Takamaru to Konoha, however the fates of Deidara and Sasori are omitted by Kakashi, who wishes to discuss it in person instead. With that, the Konoha shinobi depart back home, although not before stopping and paying their respects at Chiyo's grave. During their walk back to the village, Tenten pressures Guy to hurry up, who is lagging behind supporting Kakashi. Not wanting the others to wait for him, he tosses Kakashi in the air, placing his own backpack on his front and catching Kakashi in a piggyback fashion, which the others, especially Naruto and Sakura, find uncomfortable. Carrying Kakashi on his back, Guy uses his speed to run past them, telling them to catch up. Lee attempts to do the same with Neji, but the latter flat-out refuses.\n\nIn Konoha, Shizune receives the mission report from Suna and reports its success to Tsunade. Shizune expresses her concern over Tsunade's decision to send Naruto to engage against the Akatsuki, especially since Naruto, as a jinch\u016briki, is a target of the Akatsuki. Tsunade explains the reasoning behind her actions, telling Shizune that only a jinch\u016briki can truly understand another jinch\u016briki, and that Naruto has the ability for others to rely and depend on him.\n\nIn the woods near the Land of Rivers, Tobi and Zetsu locate Deidara's arm, with the former believing that Deidara is dead, having been blown to pieces. Deidara arrives at the same time, telling Tobi to drop his arm. Zetsu asks Deidara whether he had captured Naruto, but Deidara tells him that he had already done his duty (capturing Gaara). When Tobi mocks him, Deidara tells Tobi that if he were to bother him for a third time, he would react in kind. Tobi asks whether Deidara would proceed to blow him up; Zetsu responds that his reply counts as a third infraction, prompting Deidara to put Tobi in a neck hold using his legs.\n\nIn Konoha, a mysterious old man tells his pupil that he has arranged for him to be placed in Team Kakashi, with his mission being to keep an eye on Naruto Uzumaki. The man tells his pupil that from this moment onward, until the completion of his mission, his name is to be Sai. Sai accepts the name and responds by smiling. The man tells Sai to wipe the fake smile off his face, and Sai tells him that he had heard that smiling is a way to win people over, albeit revealing that he has trouble forming facial expressions.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "33", "Episode Title": "The_New_Target", "Japanese Airdate": "8 November 2007", "episode synopsis text": "Izumo Kamizuki and Kotetsu Hagane are tired, having been up guarding the entrance to Konoha. They notice a tremor, which ends up being Might Guy, running into the village at top speed with Kakashi on his back. Declaring himself as first place, he is soon caught up with by Lee, who declares himself second. Guy tells Lee that he is third and that Kakashi is second, causing Lee to tear up. This is witnessed not only by Izumo and Kotetsu, but by Naruto, Sakura, Tenten and Neji, who have caught up to them as well. The teams then head to the hospital in order to admit Kakashi, who is unable to move after having used his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan during his fight with Akatsuki member Deidara with Tsunade revealing that Kakashi will be bedridden for an entire week as a result of the battle.\n\nAfter Kakashi is admitted to the hospital, Sakura sprints off to the balcony, which Naruto notices. On the balcony, she notifies Tsunade and Shizune of Sasori's last words - that one of his spies, who works for Orochimaru, is supposed to be meeting him six days from now at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure. Tsunade brings up the idea that Sasori's final words may be a trap by Akatsuki, using the mention of Orochimaru's name as bait. Sakura is still adamant on going, claiming that they will defeat any Akatsuki member they encounter. Tsunade approves the quest, but tells Sakura that since Kakashi is unable to move for a week and that the rendez-vous is in six days, she will need to find a new team member to replace him on the mission. Shizune protests that she'll need to find two, since she believes Naruto should not go on any mission involving Akatsuki interference, and offers her own team. Tsunade responds that Naruto and Sakura are both driven by a need to save Sasuke, to the point where they would give their lives for him, and therefore possess the determination and will to complete the mission successfully, which is what sets them apart from Shizune's team. She also asks Shizune what Naruto would say if he had overheard her; Naruto happens to be standing on the roof, having heard the entire conversation. He announces that he will be on the search for a new team mate and heads off. Tsunade finds Naruto impatient, claiming she hadn't finished her speech about him, while Shizune muses on Tsunade's words (how Naruto has the power to make people rely and depend on him) and remembers that he is the one who won the First Hokage's necklace.\n\nIn the village, Naruto begins his quest to find a new teammate, musing that the teammate needs to be someone who is strong enough not to hold them back, someone who is friend in order for teamwork to be efficient, yet someone who is not too attractive as to distract Sakura. His outspoken thoughts are heard by Shino, who tells Naruto that it has been a while since they've met. Naruto is unable to recognise Shino immediately, insulting Shino, who believes that friends shouldn't forget one another. Their conversation is cut short by Kiba, who lands on Shino. Kiba is riding on Akamaru, who has grown to the point where he is big enough to sit on. Naruto recognises Kiba and Akamaru instantly, much to Shino's dismay. Naruto asks Kiba to join him on his mission, but Kiba states that Team 8 has already been assigned a mission and that they are simply waiting for Kurenai. Naruto spots Hinata watching them from afar, the latter of which is shy and embarrassed about encountering Naruto; Hinata faints when Naruto meets her face-to-face. As she recovers, Naruto asks Shino if he could help on their mission, since he considers Akamaru to be big enough to count as a member of a three-man squad. Shino simply remarks that Naruto was able to recognise Hinata as well, irritating Naruto. Naruto then asks Hinata to leave her team and to come with him; his words cause Hinata to go red in the face and to faint again.\n\nNaruto decides to ask Shikamaru for help, but the latter has been assigned by Tsunade to oversee the Ch\u016bnin Exams. Ch\u014dji appears, carrying Shikamaru's lunch and happy to have a reunion with Naruto. Ch\u014dji is willing to come with Naruto on his mission, despite already being assigned to a mission along with Asuma and Ino. Naruto mentions that Ch\u014dji has gained weight since they last met, prompting Shikamaru to tackle Naruto while Ch\u014dji expands his left arm. At that same moment, a beast made of ink comes charging at them, which Ch\u014dji manages to easily destroy. The attack seems to come from a Konoha shinobi (Sai), who is watching the trio from afar. Shikamaru decides to hold Sai in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique, and tells Naruto to handle the situation. Naruto heads towards Sai, only for Sai to paint six more beasts and bring them to life, sending them towards Naruto.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "34", "Episode Title": "Formation!_New_Team_Kakashi!", "Japanese Airdate": "15 November 2007", "episode synopsis text": "Tsunade, Shizune and Sakura remain on the balcony after Naruto headed off in search of a teammate. Shizune voices her concern once more about Tsunade's decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki. Shizune's concerns lie regarding the fact that Naruto may be captured by the Akatsuki. Sakura recalls when Deidara attempted to catch Naruto, only to be stopped by Kakashi. She too becomes worried that without Kakashi on their team, the Akatsuki may succeed in their mission. Tsunade, understanding her worry, decides to appoint another member to their team as well, claiming that her two replacements will fill the positions on Team 7 left open by Kakashi and Sasuke.\n\nMeanwhile, Naruto rushes towards Sai, who has sent his six ink beasts to engage Naruto. Shikamaru uses his Shadow Sewing Technique to puncture the beasts, leaving Naruto free to attack Sai with a kunai; Sai blocks the move with his sword. When Sai mentions that Naruto is weak and does not have any balls, Naruto becomes infuriated. Shikamaru attempts to ensnare Sai using his Shadow Imitation Technique, but Sai jumps in mid-air to avoid it. Naruto demands to know who Sai is, but Sai responds that Naruto will soon find out. He then disappears using his Ink Mist Technique. As he disappears, Ino shows up, looking for Ch\u014dji. She spots Naruto and is overjoyed, citing him to be a sight for sore eyes.\n\nTsunade is called into a meeting by the village elders, members of the Konoha Council. They tell her that Shizune has been meeting with them recently to discuss Tsunade's decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki, and tell Tsunade to limit the amount of missions Naruto goes on and to never let him outside the village. They go on to state that as a jinch\u016briki, he deserves to be kept confined and observed at all times, and thus believe their solution to be a compromise. The elders also state that if Naruto is ever to be given a mission, he is to be guarded by a member of the Anbu black ops at all times. Tsunade refuses to impose their restrictions on Naruto, believing Naruto to be a great ninja and asset to Konoha. However, she agrees that Team Kakashi should be restored to its original four-man state, and agrees to the elders' decision to assign a member to their team to keep on eye on Naruto. The two village elders call in Danz\u014d, another village elder, who has selected a candidate from his Root programme to be Sasuke's replacement on Team Kakashi. Tsunade accepts the decision, but notifies them that Kakashi is out of commission, and thus she will be choosing a replacement for Kakashi as well. The elders state that the replacement must be from the Anbu as well. Tsunade agrees, and leaves the room.\n\nOn her way back to her office, she berates Shizune for her betrayal, but also voices her distrust of Danz\u014d. She is also angered that Danz\u014d suggested the same thing to the village elders that she was about to (having an Anbu member placed on Team Kakashi). Needing to find another Anbu member to take Kakashi's place, she summons an Anbu captain, to whom she bestows the name \"Yamato\". Yamato accepts his name, and is told to remove his mask as his mission is not an Anbu one. Yamato is given orders to not only keep an eye on Naruto, but to keep an eye on whomever Danz\u014d had chosen to fill in for Sasuke. She explains that Danz\u014d was an ardent opponent of her sensei, the Third Hokage, who also did not trust Danz\u014d. She adds that Danz\u014d was also responsible for forming a clandestine training unit known as Root, and despite the fact that the unit was disbanded officially years ago, she still suspects that Danz\u014d is associated with it. Since Danz\u014d's candidate is also tied to Root, she orders Yamato to keep tabs on him.\n\nNaruto and Sakura then meet up at the spot where Tsunade had told them to go, the former glad that they are getting two new teammates.

Sai explains that his actions were merely to test Naruto's power, to which he has deduced that Naruto is nothing but a mere weakling. Naruto takes offence at his words, and attempts to strike Sai, only to be held back by Sakura. Sakura berates Sai's actions, but Sai states that he likes everyone, including ugly girls like Sakura. This only infuriates Sakura, but she is held back by Yamato before she can attack him. Yamato tells the team that their mission is to apprehend Sasori's spy at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure, and that the successful completion of their mission will lead to the assassination of Orochimaru and possible retrieval of former Team Kakashi member Sasuke Uchiha. With that, Yamato dismisses the team, telling them to gather their belongings and to meet him at the front gates in an hour.\n\nSai heads to his room, packing his gear, when he is attacked by a mysterious man. The man is revealed to be a member of the Anbu, who came to provide a secret report commissioned by their superior, Danz\u014d Shimura. After noticing that Sai is taking a remnant of his childhood with him, the man tells Sai to remember that as members of Root, they are to have no feelings or emotion, as they are the invisible root, the foundation, that holds up the tree known as Konohagakure. With that, the man departs. Naruto and Sakura walk back to their homes, with Sakura remarking that Sai reminds her of Sasuke. Naruto dismisses her opinion, citing that Sasuke is a million times better than Sai could ever be. Sakura and Naruto then go to their respective homes to pack their gear. Naruto glances at the official team photo of Team 7 and renews his original vow to rescue Sasuke.\n\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya arrives at the hospital to visit Kakashi. Giving Kakashi two volumes of Icha Icha, he states that he is also there to discuss something, although they must wait for Tsunade and Yamato. Although Kakashi does not recognise the name of Yamato, he is told by Jiraiya that it is a code name and that he would recognise the man when he saw him. Tsunade and Yamato soon arrive at the hospital; Yamato is briefed by Kakashi regarding Naruto's Version 1 form, in which the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra would envelop Naruto, causing him to sprout a chakra tail and go berserk. Yamato is visibly stunned by this, and Kakashi explains that by using a Chakra-Suppressing Seal, he was able to stop Naruto at just two tails. Jiraiya, who was unaware that Naruto had activated the form in his last mission, becomes grim. Kakashi asks Jiraiya how many tails he himself had seen; taking off his shirt, Jiraiya tells them that he had only been close to death twice in his life. He explains that the first time was when he was caught peeking into a ladies' hot springs by Tsunade, at which the point Tsunade broke his arms and ribs and crushed his internal organs. Showing them a scar on his torso, he explains that the second time was when Naruto entered into a four-tailed version of the Nine-Tails' cloak. This visibly worries the group, due to the fact that Naruto is able to grow up to nine tails.\n\nReady to meet Yamato, Sai and Naruto, Sakura spots Tsunade and Shizune returning from the hospital. She asks if they could speak before she departs, and they convene in Tsunade's office. Tsunade asks Sakura to brief her regarding their initial encounter with Sai. Just then, Danz\u014d enters the room, asking whether Tsunade has appointed an Anbu member on Team Kakashi. Tsunade tells him that Kakashi's replacement was a member of the Anbu from the Third Hokage's time; this prompts Danz\u014d to state that he wishes that the replacement is not as passive or gentle as Sarutobi was, claiming that Sarutobi's gutless actions were unwarranted. As he leaves, Sakura asks who he is. Tsunade tells her that Danz\u014d was a rival of her sensei, who also vied for the position of Hokage. She explains that unlike the Third's pacifist nature, Danz\u014d is a hardened man of military mind, and that the two are polar opposites. While she herself does not trust Danz\u014d, she tells Sakura that Danz\u014d himself despises her for being the granddaughter of the First Hokage, whose teachings the Third passed on (thereby making him a passive fool in Danz\u014d's eyes) and for being the student of the Third herself. Sakura then realises she's almost out of time and with Tsunade's blessing, she heads to the front gates to meet the rest of her team.\n\nAs the four members of Team Kakashi arrive at the gate, Yamato leads them on as they depart the village.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "36", "Episode Title": "The_Fake_Smile", "Japanese Airdate": "29 November 2007", "episode synopsis text": "Back in Tsunade's office, Shizune voices her concern regarding Naruto and Sai's friction.

Shizune justifies her actions by telling Tsunade that she did not think that they would appoint one of Danz\u014d's Root members to Team Kakashi. Tsunade orders Shizune to find out what Danz\u014d is up to and who exactly Sai is, and adds that she is counting on Sakura to diffuse any tension between Naruto and Sai. Shizune, however, does not think Sakura is capable of doing so, as she believes Sakura has inherited Tsunade's quick temper.\n\nOn the way to the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure, Naruto continues to glare at Sai. This prompts Sai to respond that if Naruto continues, he would hit him. Naruto is offended at the remark and lashes back. Yamato tells them that he had hoped Kakashi had taught them the value of teamwork during his tenure as team leader, and tells the group that a team needs to be founded on teamwork and trust. Naruto retorts that Sai will never be considered a true member of Team Kakashi, and that the one and only fourth member will always be Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto tells Sai that he is nothing but a stand in for Sasuke; Sai replies that he is glad that he is nothing like Sasuke as he views Sasuke to be a traitor. Naruto almost attacks Sai, but his attack is stopped by Sakura. Sakura asks Sai to forgive Naruto, telling him that Naruto is only acting the way he is because he hasn't gotten around to knowing Sai. She flashes Sai a smile, which lowers his guard. Sakura then proceeds to punch him in the face, sending him flying across the ground. Sakura tells him that while she may ask him to forgive Naruto, she does not care whether he forgives her. She warns him that if he utters any more remarks regarding Sasuke, she will not hold back next time. Sai resolves to keep his mouth shut around her, but thanks her for the opportunity for showing him that a fake smile could be used to cover a sneak attack. Yamato, sick of their fighting, creates a wooden cage. Sakura is shocked by his usage of Wood Release, since the one and only user is said to be the First Hokage, and wonders how Yamato is able to use it.\n\nYamato tells the team that they can either spend their time locked in the wooden cage or spend the rest of the day at a hot springs. The team chooses the latter, and they rest at a hot spring. Yamato tells Sai and Naruto that there is no better way to bond than to be naked and together in a hot spring. Naruto gets up, visibly discomforted by Yamato's words, only for Sai to remark that he is surprised that Naruto has balls after all. Naruto goes on a loud, verbal tirade regarding Sai's remarks regarding testicles, which the women on the other side of the hot springs overhear and laugh about; Sakura is embarrassed by Naruto and Sai. Naruto hears the laughter and becomes embarrassed himself, and Sai tells him that at least he gave Sakura a laugh. Realising that Sakura is nude on the other side of the fence, he decides to peek. Yamato, however, tells him that Jiraiya almost died when he had both of his arms and his ribs broken and his internal organs crushed, which was caused by Tsunade when he peeked on her at a hot spring. He warns Naruto that Sakura would do the same, and Naruto is paralysed in fear, staying firmly rooted in his place as Sai and Yamato exit the spring.\n\nAfter their dip in the springs, the three shinobi are greeted by a feast laid out in front of this eyes. Naruto hopes that Yamato remains as their team leader if a feast awaits them during every mission, an opinion Sakura echoes.

As \"Sasori\" gives a thumbs-up, Naruto and Sai launch an attack on the spy, who happens to be Yamato in disguise, \"Sasori/Hiruko\" being Sakura in disguise. Naruto and Sai attempt to use taijutsu to attack Yamato, but Yamato is able to avoid all of them and kick Naruto, citing that their attacks are not good enough.

Naruto tackles Yamato, and the real Sai, hiding behind a tree, uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to paint a snake and bring it to \"life\". He sends it to wrap itself around Naruto and Yamato, but the latter uses a Body Replacement Technique to avoid being tied. Sai runs off in search of the real Yamato, leaving Naruto tied up.\n\nNaruto and Sakura manage to locate Sai in the forest, who has captured Yamato. Yamato mentally remarks that Sai's skill level is too high for him to just be an alternate on this team, and believes that Tsunade had reason to doubt his placement. Sai also notes that Sakura's strength is impressive, as she managed to rip his ink snake apart, and makes a note to avoid being hit by her. Naruto angrily asks Sai if he knows what the meaning of comrade is. Sai writes out of the word comrade on a scroll, irritating Naruto, who wants to know why Sai left him tied up. Sai explains that there was no reason for Naruto make his shadow clone look like Sai if he was going to have the Sai shadow clone perform a jutsu only the real Naruto knew; by doing so, he had revealed to Yamato that the real Sai was in hiding elsewhere. When Yamato had used a Body Replacement technique to avoid the binding, Naruto had lost his cool; thus Sai decided that since he could not find and capture Yamato while also looking out for someone like Naruto, he would simply keep the latter bound until the mission was complete. Naruto begins to walk off in anger, but Sai asks him why he is so keen on saving a comrade like Sasuke when Sasuke chose to abandon his friends and Konoha for Orochimaru. Naruto clenches his fists in anger, causing Yamato to fear that Naruto will enter his Version 2 form. However, Naruto simply states that he would do anything to save a comrade, even if it means working with someone like Sai.\n\nSakura explains to Sai that Sasuke is like a brother to Naruto, and asks him to sympathise as he has a brother as well. Sai reveals that his brother had died, and that he had no clue how one would look like if they had lost a brother. He wonders if the look on Naruto's face is the same look. Sakura is taken aback by his words, and Sai reminds her that he does not feel any emotions. Yamato tells the team to go back to their wooden house for the night, and Sakura tells Sai that is he is lucky.

Kabuto and Orochimaru are amused to see Naruto and Sakura again, the latter musing whether he should bring Sasuke here to pit him against the jinch\u016briki. Naruto, who is already under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, begins to enter into his one-tailed form. Sakura and Sai watch in a mix of shock and surprise as the chakra surrounding Naruto's body begins to engulf the air. As Orochimaru mentions Sasuke's name again, Naruto grows a second tail and rushes at him with superhuman speed, punching Orochimaru in the face and causing him to go through several yards worth of trees. As Orochimaru makes his way back to the bridge, the part of his face where Naruto struck him has peeled, revealing the face of Gen'y\u016bmaru, the host body Orochimaru is currently occupying. Using his Face Copying Technique, Orochimaru reapplies his face as he remarks how Naruto is finally beginning to act like a jinch\u016briki; Kabuto himself states that Naruto, using the Nine-Tailed Fox's power, has grown considerably in strength.\n\nYamato recalls his conversation with Jiraiya, Tsunade and Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, where Kakashi and Jiraiya were warning him about Naruto's \"Nine-Tails' Cloak Form\". Jiraiya had told Yamato that other than the time where Tsunade nearly killed him for peeking on her when she was nude, the only other time he had almost died was when Naruto entered his four-tailed form. Jiraiya explained that whenever Naruto gave in to anger, the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra would begin to leak out and envelop him. As Naruto's anger and rage grew, he would begin to grow more tails. On top of that, Naruto could only maintain his consciousness up to three tails; if he were to grow a fourth, his mind would succumb to the Nine-Tails' influence and he would instinctively attack on pure rage alone. Jiraiya likens Naruto's Version 2 form to being a mini version of the Nine-Tailed Fox itself. Jiraiya revealed to the group that when Naruto enters into his four-tailed form, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox burns his skin off, causing immense pain and leaving Naruto to be covered by just blood and chakra. After the transformation subsides, the Nine-Tails' chakra then begins to heal him; the process of egregious damage followed by rapid recovery is shortening Naruto's lifespan. Tsunade had asked how this is even possible, and Jiraiya had explained that the seal the Fourth Hokage had used was beginning to weaken over time, explaining why Naruto was succumbing to the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra much more during his bouts of anger as opposed to when he was younger. Tsunade, Jiraiya and Kakashi tell Yamato that he is the only one who can keep Naruto in check since he has the power of the First Hokage in his blood.\n\nBack on the bridge, Orochimaru realises that Yamato is team captain only because Naruto is a jinch\u016briki, citing that Konoha should be grateful for his experiments. When Kabuto asks what he means, Orochimaru reveals that back when he was a Konoha shinobi, he harvested DNA cells from the remains of the First Hokage and attempted to transplant them into babies and children; none of them survived, however. Before he could officially terminate the experiment and dispose of the subjects, he had been caught by the Third Hokage with another experiment in another laboratory, forcing him to flee Konoha. He realises that one of those babies who had been injected with the First Hokage's cells had survived, and that the child is none other than Yamato. Sakura recalls Yamato creating the wooden cage and how she wondered how Yamato was able to use the First's technique, and finally understands the reasoning. Orochimaru adds that the First Hokage had the ability to control tailed beasts, and that since Yamato has the power of the First within him, Konoha assigned him to keep watch on Naruto and control him if need be. \n\nWhen Naruto demands that Orochimaru and Kabuto return Sasuke to them, the duo state that Sasuke came to them of his own accord. Orochimaru tells Naruto that if he wishes to know anything about Sasuke then he would have to beat it out of him. Naruto gives in even more to the Nine-Tails' influence and grows a third tail.

Kabuto, sensing the attack, decides to strike Naruto from behind with his Chakra Scalpel. Naruto notices him coming and emits a roar, and his chakra sends Kabuto flying backwards into Sakura, knocking her out. Kabuto continues to soar through the bridge, with Sai and Yamato moving out of the way, as he crashes into a tree in the woods. Naruto's attack ends up destroying the Tenchi Bridge, and he goes after Orochimaru, who is on the other side of the bridge. Sai claims that it is the perfect time for his real mission to start, and using his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique creates a giant ink bird. He begins to fly in Naruto and Orochimaru's direction while Sakura, who is knocked out, begins to fall off the bridge. Yamato asks Sai to catch her, but Sai, despite being able to do so, avoids her and lets her fall. Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to steady the collapsing bridge and to catch Sakura.\n\nOn the other side, the three-tailed Naruto manages to rip Orochimaru's arm off. Orochimaru, however, uses a body replacement technique that causes him to materialise and regurgitate a new body from his mouth, restoring the limb he had lost. Orochimaru claims that Naruto still isn't good enough and that he's not as strong as Sasuke. In the woods, Kabuto uses his chakra to heal his wounds, while remarking that he finally understands why the Akatsuki are after Naruto, having experienced a sample of the true power of a jinch\u016briki.\n\nNaruto begins to fade into the recesses of his mind, where he finds himself in a dark area covered with water. However, as the light appears, he sees Sasuke running. Naruto attempts to follow him, but is unable to run through the water quickly enough to catch Sasuke, who is riding on top of the water. As the water rises, Naruto struggles to move underwater as Sasuke disappears from view. Naruto recalls his last fight with Sasuke, and how he was unable to prevent his friend from defecting and joining Orochimaru. He berates himself for lacking the strength to stop Sasuke, and vows that he will not allow Sasuke to break the bond of friendship they have between them. Naruto then begins to float through the water until he reaches a huge cage. Naruto begins to slip through the bars of the cage, which is where the Nine-Tailed Fox is imprisoned. The demon fox holds Naruto in his palms as he begins to allow his power to take over Naruto.\n\nIn the real world, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox begins to rip, burn and peel away Naruto's skin, leaving just blood and chakra; his peeled skin is soon incinerated by the chakra. Naruto sprouts a fourth tail, and enters into his Version 2 form. Yamato and Sakura notices a smoke-like trail left by his chakra while Sai observes the transformation from above. Yamato stays with Sakura while creating a wood clone to find Naruto. Naruto's painful transformation causes him to emanate a wave of chakra, which cracks the trees around them and bursts the giant ink bird Sai is riding on. The Yamato wood clone manages to protect itself by using Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall, forming a wooden shield. Orochimaru, who also survives the attack, states that Naruto has managed to pique his interest, and wonders what the outcome will be. The Yamato wood clone then sees Naruto's four-tailed form, and curses himself for being unable to prevent it.

As the chakra begins to burn Orochimaru as well, he uses his body replacement technique to regurgitate a new body out of his mouth before the old one is incinerated. Retaining the bottom half of a snake, he slithers in a rapid manner towards Naruto and punches Naruto in the face. Naruto is able to grow another fox head and claws out his chakra and manages to bisect Orochimaru. Using his Gathering of the Snakes technique, Orochimaru is able to connect and regenerate both of his halves. He attempts to finish Naruto off by spitting out one thousand snakes, each armed with a sword in their mouths. However, Naruto uses one hand to create a devastating blast of pure chakra that incinerates the snakes and sends Orochimaru flying. Sai and the Yamato wood clone are unable to interfere due to the intensity of the battle; the wood clone, however, informs Yamato that Naruto has indeed reached his four-tailed form.\n\nSakura and Yamato are approached on the remains of the Tenchi Bridge by Kabuto, who wonders how Konoha knew that he was to meet Sasori at this time and place. Kabuto states that not even the other Akatsuki members knew of the meeting, and since Sasori isn't the type to give up information under torture, he must have been captured or killed. When Sakura tells him that it's the latter, Kabuto finds joy in it. He tells Yamato and Sakura that Sasori bore a grudge towards Orochimaru and always claimed that he would kill him, and therefore must have told them about his secret meeting in order for them to kill Orochimaru on his behalf.\n\nOn the other side of the destroyed bridge, Naruto prepares himself to use the ultimate tailed beast technique - Tailed Beast Ball. Yamato's wood clone wonders how Naruto is still able to move despite having so much chakra on his body, and Orochimaru echoes the sentiment, claiming that that degree of dense chakra should weigh him down. As Naruto swallows the chakra balls, the increased density does indeed cause him to sink into the ground; nonetheless, he fires the Tailed Beast Bomb as a beam towards Orochimaru. The Sannin tries to block the move by summoning Triple Rash\u014dmon, one of his highest defensive techniques, but the Triple Rash\u014dmon is completely obliterated by the Tailed Beast Bomb. At the end of his rope, Orochimaru resorts to using his Sword of Kusanagi in an attempt to impale Naruto. While the sword does hit him, it does not impale; instead, Naruto is send flying through the air and into a wall near the bridge.

Sai is observing Orochimaru, unaware that he is being watched by Yamato's wood clone. Orochimaru states that Gen'y\u016bmaru's body is beginning to reject him and that he is at his limit right now, though he comforts himself over the thought of still having Sasuke.\n\nKabuto states that he is surprised that Naruto would go this far to save Sasuke, claiming that the boy is gone and only the monster remains. His words cause Sakura to remember Naruto's promise to her - that he would bring Sasuke back no matter what, and that as his nindo, he would not go back on his promise. Sakura runs towards him in tears, despite Yamato's warning. She attempts to tell Naruto to change back, but Naruto simply smacks her aside with his tail, harming her. Before he can kill her, Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to create tree trunks to bind Naruto. Kabuto heads towards Sakura, and Yamato, believing that he is about to finish off a wounded Sakura, binds him as well. Kabuto tells him that he is actually attempting to save Sakura, and he heals her wounds to the best of his ability. He tells them that they share a common enemy - the Akatsuki - and that he is sparing and saving their lives just so that they can continue to dwindle down their numbers. As Kabuto leaves, Naruto manages to break out of the wooden restraints.

Orochimaru is surprised that Danz\u014d is still alive and agrees to hear the message, but warns Sai to choose his words very carefully, lest he get killed.

The real Sai pops out of the ground, and Orochimaru tells him to prove that he can be trusted. As he attempts to retrieve something out of his pack, he is tackled by Kabuto. Sai's belongings fall out and scatter on the ground, including an envelope. Sai tells Orochimaru that the contents of the envelope is personally addressed to the Sannin by Danz\u014d himself.

Sakura notices that all of Naruto's skin has been burned off and that he is extremely wounded, and uses her Mystical Palm Technique to regenerate his skin. As she heals him, she asks Yamato to teach her his technique, but the captain explains that only he can perform that technique as he carries the DNA of the First Hokage within him. He tells her that the necklace that Naruto wears, which is the First Hokage's Necklace, is made of a special gem that is able to control a jinch\u016briki or a tailed beast when conjoined with the First Hokage's chakra, and therefore only those who have his cells can replicate it, although to a lesser degree than the First could have himself.\n\nSakura manages to regenerate Naruto's burned skin and Naruto regains consciousness.

Since Danz\u014d does not agree with those principles, it is very likely that he is planning to collaborate with Orochimaru to destroy Konoha, so that Tsunade would become ousted as Hokage following the aftermath, allowing Danz\u014d to become the new Hokage and to subsequently rebuild the village as he sees fit. Sakura deduces that while Orochimaru failed last time, Danz\u014d is most likely offering internal support this time around, with Sai being the mutual conduit.

Sai regains his composure and tells Sasuke that he must be the one Naruto is looking for. The mention of Naruto's name piques Sasuke's interest, but the latter merely rebuffs that he sounds familiar.

She goes on to state that his care for the book is due to the fact that is the only thing that reminds him that he has a brother whom he shared a bond with. Sai claims that there was no such bond, and adds that his name isn't even Sai; rather, he has no name and his mere existence is to serve as Danz\u014d's tool.

The demon fox is impressed that Sasuke is able to see him inside of Naruto via his Sharingan and remarks that his physical appearance along with his kekkei genkai being much advanced than his years would belie makes him a spitting image of Madara Uchiha from the elder days. Sasuke manages to burst the demon fox's chakra, telling the fox that he does not recognise the name nor does he care. Both the fox and Naruto are astonished that Sasuke was able to suppress the tailed beast's chakra, but before subsiding, he warns Sasuke not to kill Naruto.\n\nIn the real world, Naruto awakens back in his normal state as Sasuke looks at him. Yamato uses his Wood Release to force Sasuke's Chidori-enhanced katana out of his torso and attempts to trap him using his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall technique to form a wooden dome around Sasuke. Sasuke, however, breaks out of the dome, and Team Kakashi is left marvelling at Sasuke's vastly improved skills and strength.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "53", "Episode Title": "Title", "Japanese Airdate": "3 April 2008", "episode synopsis text": "Naruto and Sakura cry for failing once again to retrieve Sasuke.

Sai is in the Konoha Library reading books on how to create and forge friendships. Sakura spots him in the library and invites him to come with her and Naruto to visit Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, stating that as a member of Team Kakashi, he should meet their leader. Naruto is sitting on some steps, musing over Sasuke's remarks about giving himself over to Orochimaru if it ensured exacting his vengeance upon Itachi. He is broken out of his reverie by Sakura, although he is irritated to see Sai. As Sakura calls Naruto a dummy, Sai remembers an excerpt from the library book that explained how friends use nicknames to breed familiarity and sustain a friendship. He asks Sakura and Naruto if he may enter their conversation, surprising them. He reveals what he was doing in the library, to their astonishment. Sakura is taken aback by his desire to form a friendship while Naruto, who did not think Sai would ever care about their friendship, tells him not to worry and to let it come naturally. Wanting to create nicknames for the two, Sai is unable to find the correct words and is told by Sakura to use personality traits as a basis. After checking Sakura out, which causes her to blushes, he smiles and calls her ugly; Naruto attempts to restrain her, but she proceeds to beat both him and Sai up.\n\nAs they visit Kakashi in the hospital, Kakashi notices that Naruto and Sai are bruised and wonders if the two got into a fight. Naruto attempts to tell Kakashi that they met Sasuke, but Kakashi tells them that he already knows as Yamato had debriefed him. Naruto and Sakura remark that Sasuke has gotten exceedingly strong, the latter even believing that he may be undertaking drug enhancement under Kabuto's supervision in order to accelerate his growth. Kakashi states that the team would simply have to get stronger, especially Naruto, to whom he has devised a new training strategy. When Naruto inquires about the strategy, Kakashi tells him that the two of them will be creating a brand new, unique ninjutsu technique more powerful than the Rasengan that only he would be able to use. Before they can get into the specifics, Asuma and the rest of Team 10 enter the room. Asuma wishes to speak to Kakashi in private while telling Teams 7 and 10 to enjoy a barbeque lunch on his behalf. Ino notices Sai and develops an infatuation on him; Shikamaru and Ch\u014dji also notice and remember Sai, but Sai introduces himself to them and explains the reasoning behind his attack, which was to test Naruto since they were going to be teammates. Shikamaru privately tells Naruto that Tsunade had informed him about his encounter with Sasuke, and now that the Ch\u016bnin Exams were over, he would be free to tag along the next time. He does, however, remark that Naruto has missed the exams due to his mission and therefore is still a genin.\n\nShikamaru excuses himself from the restaurant in order to help the Nara clan with some medicinal task, although his true motive is to join Asuma and Kakashi's conversation regarding the Akatsuki. Asuma states that word of their activities has increased outside of the village, and due to their hunt for tailed beasts, it would only be a matter of time before they reached Konoha. Shikamaru also wonders whether Naruto would be able to defend himself, seeing as Gaara, who is a Kage, lost. Kakashi states that Naruto will get strong enough in time.\n\nAt the restaurant, Ino sits next to Sai in an attempt to be close to him. Ch\u014dji is told by Ino to introduce himself to Sai before eating, and Sai, wanting to create a nickname for him based on personality traits, begins to call him a fatso; however, both Naruto and Sakura predict his choice of words and Naruto gets up and covers his mouth, telling Sai that fatso is not an acceptable word to call Ch\u014dji. Sai realises that certain words are not acceptable to use as nicknames, and after his incident with Sakura, believes that women do not like to be called what they look like; instead, he chooses to refer to women as the opposite of what they are. After looking at Ino, he decides to call her beautiful. Naruto sighs in relief as Sai has finally managed to compliment a girl without her beating him up, but looks to Sakura to see how she would react; Sakura, irked that Sai called her ugly but called Ino beautiful, proceeds to trash the restaurant and pounds Sai.\n\nOutside the village, two grave robbers ransack graves, only to claim that they haven't found whom they're looking for.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "55", "Episode Title": "Wind", "Japanese Airdate": "17 April 2008", "episode synopsis text": null}, {"Episode Number": "56", "Episode Title": "Writhe", "Japanese Airdate": "24 April 2008", "episode synopsis text": "Naruto continues with with his chakra nature training, with Yamato on standby, although he can only manage to cause some leaves to tear.

Not wanting to give up when he feels so close, Naruto uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to resume his training once more, this time with all the shadow clones possessing the prior knowledge and experience. Struck with a thought, Naruto asks Kakashi whether there are any other shinobi in Konoha who possess Wind Release, in order for him to ask them for advice. Kakashi tells him that he does know one person who does, who would most likely be playing sh\u014dgi at the moment.\n\nAt the same time, Asuma Sarutobi and Shikamaru are playing sh\u014dgi, with the winner having to pay for Team Asuma's next post-win barbecue. Asuma loses the game, but Shikamaru's victory is cut short by the arrival of Naruto, who wishes to have Asuma give him tips on wind-natured chakra. Shikamaru is in disbelief that Naruto is attempting chakra nature training, claiming it to be too difficult for Naruto to master. Asuma himself is surprised that Naruto is a wind nature type, but agrees to give advice if Naruto is willing to pick up Team Asuma's tab on their next dinner. After checking Gama-chan, his frog purse, Naruto claims he has just enough money to do so, and agrees. Asuma produces his Chakra Blades, and infuses them with his wind-type chakra. Naruto attempts to do so as well, albeit not to the same degree as Asuma's, the latter claiming that Naruto should grind his chakra against one another. Naruto questions why one would infuse their chakra into blades when the blades are already sharp as is. Asuma tells Naruto to throw the blades at the trees; when Naruto does so, it hits a tree, but Asuma's goes through the tree and penetrates a boulder. He tells Naruto that he was holding back and that he could have gone through the boulder as well. Naruto enthusiastically thanks Asuma for his advice, which Asuma promises to offer if Naruto is willing to pick the team's dinner bill. Naruto dispels himself, much to Shikamaru's surprise, revealing himself to have been nothing more than a shadow clone. Shikamaru adds that Asuma was cruel for passing on the bill to Naruto, due to Ch\u014dji Akimichi's appetite.\n\nIn Tsunade's office, Shizune notifies Tsunade regarding an assault on a neighbouring village in the Land of Fire, which she believes to be the work of Amegakure. Tsuande is infuriated that one of the allied nations would risk starting a war by attacking another nation and asks for Asuma's team. Shizune brings up her concern over keeping Naruto in the village in the event that it was the Akatsuki, and Tsunade decides to send him out on a D-ranked mission regarding grave robbers. Meanwhile, The Naruto shadow clone returns to the clearing and shares the advice with the other Naruto's, unaware that Sai is watching him and drawing his likeness. Naruto manages to use Asuma's advice to grind his chakra against one another, and him and his shadow clones manage to tear their leaves in two. Feeling elated at his success, Naruto dispels the clones to acquire their experience, although the combined fatigue causes him to pass out. Kakashi catches the unconscious Naruto, and Sai, along with Sakura, who had joined at the last moment, come rushing out. After asking if Naruto is alright, Sakura notifies Kakashi that the team is wanted by Tsunade.\n\nAt the Yamanaka flower shop, Asuma buys a bouquet of flowers, although he doesn't reveal to whom. Ino tells him to say hi to Kurenai for her, causing Asuma to go red and wonder how she found out. Shikamaru and Ch\u014dji also see Asuma step out of the store with flowers and they tell him to wish Kurenai well. Asuma asks how they know, and Shikamaru tells him that despite his efforts to hide their relationship, everybody is already aware of it. Ch\u014dji prods Shikamaru to move on to more pressing matters, and Shikamaru notifies Asuma and Ino that the entire team is being tasked to go out on a mission by Tsunade.\n\nTeam Asuma arrives at Tsunade's office, where the Hokage debriefs them on their mission and notifies the team that the Akatsuki may be involved. She tells them all to take great care, and dismisses them. On a rooftop, Asuma stares longingly at Kurenai, who is in her room, but decides against approaching her and instead prepares to set off with his team. They notice Naruto, Sakura, Sai and Yamato heading off on a mission as a well, with Naruto being irritated that his training was interrupted for a mission. Konohamaru and the rest of Team Ebisu pass by, having caught another cat as per their mission. He wishes Naruto and Uncle Asuma well on their mission, prompting to Naruto to wonder why Konohamaru referred to Asuma as his uncle. Shikamaru notifies him that Asuma is the Third Hokage's son and hence Konohamaru's actual uncle. Naruto is surprised to learn of this, as are Ino and Ch\u014dji. Asuma dismisses his parentage as no big deal, but Naruto tells him that he feels like he has a special bond with Asuma since they share the same chakra nature type, and that the bond is strengthened by the fact that Asuma is the son of the Third Hokage. As Team Yamato begin to depart on their mission, Asuma reminds Naruto of his advice and asks Yamato to protect Naruto.\n\nBack in Tsunade's office, Kakashi reports on Naruto's training methods and is given a separate mission by the Hokage.

He tells them that a shinobi's corpse holds a wealth of information that would be considered a gold mine by interested parties.\n\nThe next morning, Naruto notices leaves flying in the wind and decides to stop and practise his training. As he is hunched over, Sai notices Naruto trembling and believes that Naruto is still scared by Yamato's story the other night, when Yamato had stated that the graves could have been disturbed by the very ninja who rested in them, having returned back to life. Naruto succeeds in tearing his leaf into a perfect half, and is ecstatic about his progress. When they reach their meeting point, Yamato is unable to locate any of the monks from the Fire Temple who were supposed to meet them there. Yamato and Sakura head off to locate them while Sai and Naruto are told to wait in case any of the monks arrive. When an owl in a tree frightens Naruto, Sai consults one of his books, which states that if a friend is frightened, they should show some tenderness by putting their arm around them. Sai gets up and sits next to Naruto, and proceeds to pull him into a one-armed hug, disturbing Naruto. Sai notices Naruto's perturbed facial reaction and attempts to use his other hand as well, leaning in for a hug. Naruto breaks free and berates Sai for his actions, claiming he does not like Sai like that. Sai attempts to explain his actions to Naruto and finds an excerpt in his book about being misunderstood by a friend, but Naruto runs off, deciding to find Sakura instead. \n\nOn his walk, he hears rustling in a bush, and believing it to be the grave robbers, throws a shuriken at it. The rustling turns out to be the work of a boar, who proceeds to chase Naruto. Naruto manages to avoid the boar, who drops a barrier seal, and stumbles upon one of the Fire Temple's hidden tombs. After entering the tomb, he notices that the coffin is gone. His sojourn in the tomb is interrupted by Sora, a monk-in-training. Each of them believes the other to be a grave robber, and the two engage in a fight, nearly destroying the tomb. Despite Naruto using both his Shadow Clone Technique and his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the shadow clones are easily defeated by Sora's Beast Tearing Palm technique, which he channels through his Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw. Naruto recognises Sora's attack as a Wind Release technique and tries to discuss it, only for Sora to attempt to kill him. Their scuffle, however, is stopped by the other monks and the rest of Team Yamato. After clearing up their confusion, the other two monks notify Chiriku, another monk, that the coffin has indeed been stolen, and he orders them to tighten up security on the other hidden tombs. He also explains to Sora, who protests Konoha's involvement, that Konoha shinobi are needed to deal with grave robbers who are skilled enough to break through their barrier seals.\n\nAs the monks and Team Yamato head to the Fire Temple, Naruto attempts to ask Sora about his wind techniques, only for Sora to ignore him.

This further's Naruto's irritation towards Sora, but stops when he notices all the glares the other monks give Sora, which seems familiar to him. In the Fire Temple, monk Chiriku explains that the men whose graves were robbed were all fallen members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, shinobi who were sworn to protect the Land of Fire's daimy\u014d. Naruto is confused over the existence of the Guardian Ninja, wondering why they would be required to protect the Land of Fire if the shinobi of Konohagakure, a village located in the Land of Fire, are also sworn to protect it. Yamato explains that the shinobi of Konoha protect the nation as a whole with the Guardian Ninja are tasked with protecting only the daimy\u014d, the feudal lord who is the head of the Land of Fire. He also reveals that Asuma was once one of the twelve guardians.\n\nNaruto and Sakura are impressed, and Chiriku hopes Asuma is still well. Chiriku divulges more about the Guardians, explaining that once long ago, all twelve were assigned to protect the daimy\u014d; however, six of them wished to have all the neighbouring lands under the Fire Daimy\u014d's control in the Land of Fire and attempted to invade them. Once the daimy\u014d had caught wind of their plans, he had ordered the other six to eliminate the conspiratorial half, in which a battle ensued, leaving only Asuma and Chiriku as the survivors. Sai realises that this means that the men whose tombs were defiled and whose bodies were taken were friends and comrades of Asuma and Chiriku, thus making the issue personal for them. Sai drives his point home when he compares it to what Naruto and Sakura must feel if the same ever happened to Sasuke. Naruto gives Chiriku his word that they will apprehend the grave robbers once and for all.\n\nOutside the temple, the team witnesses the monks sparring, and Naruto notices that Sora is holding back. Entering the sparring match himself, Naruto and Sora begin exchanging blows, although Sora's attacks are much more forceful. Sora tells Naruto that he would bestow a new name upon the genin for the afterlife, but after noticing all the other monks staring at him, Sora becomes enraged and his attacks lose focus, allowing Naruto to easily dodge all of them; Naruto manages to land a kick in Sora's face as Chiriku ends the match. As Sora storms off, under the glare of the other monks, Naruto retreats to treat his bruise; Sai attempts to wipe his brow, an idea he picked up from his book.

Naruto inquires him over his usage of Wind Release, and Sora retaliates by attempting to hit Naruto; Naruto easily avoids and blocks all of Sora's moves. Sora asks whether Naruto was always this annoying, and Naruto responds that people always thought so; he also deduces, based on the glares Sora gets, that Sora must also feel the same. Sora admits that nobody likes him, but that out of everyone, he dislikes himself the most. He blames it on a hidden power he possesses inside of him, one that he believes he cannot get rid of but needs in order to avenge his father's murder. Before he can continue on any further, he notices a patrol bird from one of the hidden tombs and he, along with Naruto, return to the temple.

Wanting to end the fight, Asuma stops their attacks with his mere hands while Shikamaru freezes them in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique; however, Ch\u014dji, who was mid-air, is unaffected by it and ends up hitting Shikamaru in the face. Asuma then tells the team to go have some barbecue after their bout. Sora attempts to refuse the invitation by claiming that he is not hungry, but his grumbling stomach betrays him.\n\nAt Yakiniku Q, Sora attempts to ask Asuma if he knew Kazuma, his father. Asuma attempts to steer the conversation in another way, and Naruto takes the opportunity to ask Asuma to teach Sora his technique, since all three of them possess Wind Release. In the woods, Asuma unveils his chakra blades and, infusing his chakra with his wind nature, has his blades go through a tree and strike the boulder behind it. Using their kunai, Naruto and Sora decide to attempt the same thing.

Naruto and Sora do not wish to waste time learning team formations when they would rather use their time to continue their Nature Transformation training. However, Naruto asks Yamato regarding the five elements and asks whether it would be possible for him to learn a secondary type, such as Water Release, by the time he became J\u014dnin. Yamato explains that one does not learn new chakra types, but must be born with the affinity to use it; however, their dominant affinity would make the other types significantly weaker. Naruto asks how one who possesses all five would be able to use them successfully, to which Yamato tells them that there has never been a shinobi who has possessed all five. This leaves Naruto to muse how F\u016bka was able to do so, but his thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. Interrupting their session, he reminds Yamato that Sora would not remain a member of Team Kakashi for long, and therefore learning team formations would be useless. On top of that, neither Naruto nor Sora would actually take the time to learn and utilise the formation, as they both possess strong techniques and would rather enter a battle headfirst, and instead advises Sakura and Yamato to back them up. With that in mind, Yamato calls off their formation training session, although he reminds Naruto and Sora that Asuma is on standby and thus is free to take over their nature transformation training, much to the latter's chagrin.\n\nin Tsunade's office, she alerts Yamato to a message she had received from Chiriku, notifying them about a secret regarding Sora. About a decade ago, Sora had unleashed some mysterious power that nearly destroyed the Fire Temple, wounding many monks. While he was subjected to medical tests, the cause of his true power was undetected and the temple kept the boy under constant surveillance. However, Sora never had another episode. Despite that, those who witnessed the attack despises Sora, hence Sora's feelings of the Fire Temple not being his true home. Chiriku had found the matter important to share with Tsunade, and Yamato remarks on the further coincidences that both Sora and Naruto share.\n\nIn the woods, Asuma watches over Naruto and Sora attempting to master their Wind Release ability. After a few hours, he tells the two that they should continue their training tomorrow as it is getting late, but the two believe that Asuma would be training them again the next day and rejoice. The next day, Naruto and Sora continue using their kunai to destroy a tree. Asuma is surprised that the two are able to create their current level of damage without using chakra blades, further demonstrating the pair's strength. Asuma performs the same technique with a kunai; it punctures the tree but does not create a hole around it. He tells the two to concentrate on their wind chakra instead of distracting themselves with the idea of destroying the tree. As he marvels on the duo's stamina levels, he notices Sora's backpack. He then calls for a lunch break and treats the two at Ramen Ichiraku. As Naruto rushes off after lunch to resume training, Asuma pulls Sora aside and presents the latter's Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw, which Asuma had reforged with the same metal as his trench knives. Sora does not thank Asuma and runs out after Asuma claims he does not have time to oversee their training any longer. Asuma recalls how it was he who killed Sora's father, Kazuma, after Kazuma decided to murder the Hokage in an attempt to bring all of the neighbouring lands under the control of the Fire Daimy\u014d. His thoughts are interrupted by Kurenai, who is able to tell that there is something bothering him due to the recent increase in his smoking habits, suggesting that he should quit.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsunade is notified that Danz\u014d Shimura has somehow escaped, managing to slip away from the Anbu sent to keep him under watch. Strolling through the village, Sora sees a father and son, who after buying food, reminds his son to thank him. Sora recalls Asuma repairing his claws and the fact that he did not thank Asuma. Naruto locates Sora from a bridge, but he is not the only one who has found Sora; Furido, the mastermind behind the grave robberies, has managed to track Sora to Konohagakure. He ambushes Sora when the monk-in-training is alone, and reminds him to use his hidden power for the greater good of the Land of Fire. Giving Sora two king pieces from a sh\u014dgi set, he reveals to Sora that it was Asuma who had killed his father.\n\nFollowing this reveal, Sora retreats to the woods, where he is joined by Naruto. Rejecting Naruto's attempts at conversation, Sora channels his anger into his chakra and throws his kunai at a tree, causing the kunai to go through it and shatter the boulder behind it.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "64", "Episode Title": "The_Jet-Black_Signal_Fire", "Japanese Airdate": "3 July 2008", "episode synopsis text": "Danz\u014d is caught by the Anbu meeting with an Amegakure ninja in the woods. Both of them are chained and brought back to Konohagakure in order to be interrogated by Tsunade. At the Konoha Hospital, Naruto visits Sai, reading his books while Sai repeats Sakura's advice about gaining real-life experiences. Looking out the window, Sai is stunned when he spots Danz\u014d being detained and brought into the village. As Danz\u014d and the spy, Tatsuji, are brought into a secret meeting place, Tsunade summons Asuma and Yamato to the meeting as well. Sora, who was tailing Asuma, follows him to the meeting and hides in the rafters.\n\nTsunade asks Danz\u014d to explain himself, asking why he would meet with an Ame-nin when tensions are so high after Amegakure was suspected of being responsible for attacking numerous villages. Danz\u014d states that Tsunade is incompetent as Hokage if she did not even know that Amegakure were not the culprits. Yamato reveals that he recognises Tatsuji as a member of the Anbu that went missing on a mission years ago. Tsunade moves on to Tatsuji, bringing in Ibiki Morino to torture him until he gave up information. However, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, the village elders and members of the Konoha Council, state that Tatsuji was a spy sent by Danz\u014d into Amegakure and that he was not only reporting information back to him, but to them as well. In an attempt to make Tsunade look inept, Danz\u014d takes the opportunity to discuss the grave robberies near the Fire Temple and how Tsunade welcomed Sora to the village with open arms, despite Sora possessing a dangerous power that nearly destroyed the temple. When Koharu states that Sora should be kept under lock and key, Danz\u014d states the best thing to do would be to eliminate him, unaware that Sora himself is eavesdropping from the rafters. However, Y\u016bgao Uzuki and another Anbu member locate him and bring him down to Tsunade's attention.\n\nSora vehemently protests against his capture, blaming Tsunade and Konoha for wanting to kill him due to the power he possesses within him and citing his own fault for trusting Yamato, his team, and the village itself. He then asks Asuma if he had killed Kazuma, and Asuma bluntly reveals that he did. Manifesting his chakra and transforming his right hand into a monstrous limb, Sora knocks out the Anbu members holding him and attempts to attack Asuma, who blocks the former's Beast Tearing Gale Palm with his chakra blades. Their bout destroys the wall, and the fight continues outside. The destruction of the wall sends a plume of smoke into the sky, which Naruto notices. Asuma manages to kick Sora into a wall, but when Sora attempts to get back up and attack again, his arm transforms back into normal. An Anbu member decides to take the opportunity to kill Sora with shuriken, but Naruto leaps in front of its path. When Sora blames Naruto for butting in, Naruto recalls Sora having his back in the cave, and repeats Sora's words. Asuma notices that the Anbu member who tried to kill Sora is from Root, but before anybody is able to interfere, Sora is whisked away by Furido. Naruto then faints from having shuriken embedded in his back.\n\nIn the hospital, Naruto has a nightmare about the monks of the Fire Temple attempting to seal a tailed beast's chakra, although to no avail. As the jinch\u016briki in his dream destroys the Iron Walls of the temple, he seems a glimpse of the Nine-Tailed Fox; Naruto then wakes up. Meanwhile, Shikamaru, Ch\u014dji and Kiba are tasked with locating Sora. On the outskirts of the village, Furido explains to Sora that the Land of Fire could not have two great kings, equal with power; hence, Kazuma, Sora's father, attempted to unite both great kings, the Fire Daimy\u014d and Konoha's Hokage. However, his plan was failed by Asuma, who stood with his Hokage. Furido explains that Kazuma's ultimate goal was for the welfare of the Land of Fire, and that it was he who bestowed Sora's power to him. He asks Sora to help him fulfil Kazuma's wish, and in doing so, he would grant Sora as many opportunities as possible for settling the score with Asuma.\n\nDischarged from the hospital, Naruto goes on a walk with Sakura, with the latter expressing her marvel over Naruto's healing abilities. As the two split up, Naruto senses Sora's negative emotions and malevolent chakra. He senses Sora near Tsunade's office, and heads in that direction. In her office, Tsunade puts down a pen and prepares to sit back and relax as a projectile is headed her way. Before she can be killed, Naruto barges into her office and tackles her, saving her life. Sora jumps in through the window and attempts to use his monstrous arm to finish the job, but is impeded by Naruto.

Sora tells him that Tsunade tried to kill him, so he attempted to do the same before she could finish the job. Naruto is unable to believe that she would do such a thing, and their bout is interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. When Asuma asks the same question, Sora responds that he was just trying to take down Konoha's king; his usage of the word \"king\" reminds Asuma of Kazuma's exact words. He tells Sora and Naruto that whomever is attacking the village right now will not just kill Tsunade, but destroy the entire village.

Naruto jumps out of the way to escape her Lightning Release techniques, but is confused when she retaliates with her Earth Release: Mud Spore to create a mudslide once more.

After he had cut her, she had switched to another body that possessed Earth instead of Lightning, explaining the difference in technique and the \"healing\" of her wounds.

As Zetsu leaves with Yugito, Hidan and Kakuzu set off towards the Land of Fire to find themselves another jinch\u016briki.\n\nBack in Konoha, Naruto is discharged from the hospital and is ready to resume his training. When Yamato and Kakashi ask him to review over what he learned so far, Naruto uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to create shadow clones and has them all perform the leaf cutting technique.

Using his Earth Release: Earth Spear, Kakuzu breaks down the Sealed Iron Wall of the temple. Inside, the monks alert Chiriku about the Akatsuki's invasion. Kakuzu recognises Chiriku as a monk who possesses the Gift of the Hermit Group's chakra and has a 30 million bounty on his head. Kakuzu and Hidan go for the attack, but Chiriku uses his Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder, the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple, to block and counter all of their attacks. As Chiriku promises them a funeral, Hidan is outraged at the idea of his funeral rites being presided over by another religion, and receives Kakuzu's blessing to kill Chiriku, although he stipulates that Chiriku be recognisable at the end in order to claim the bounty. The notion of killing humans for money is found despicable by Hidan, but he nonetheless charges at Chiriku with his Triple-Bladed Scythe.\n\nAs Naruto wakes up, Kakashi explains that the next stage would be to complete his nature transformation by converting his chakra into wind and stopping the flow of a waterfall. Yamato uses his Wood Release to fashion a bridge; using his shadow clones, Naruto stands on the bridge and attempts to slice the flow of the waterfall, recalling Asuma's advice. Unbeknownst to him, both Sai and Sakura are witnessing his training from the woods.\n\nAt the Fire Temple, Hidan is finishing his Jashin ritual, having killed Chiriku and nearly every other monk, save for Sentoki, who decides to report the massacre to Konoha. Kakuzu takes Chiriku's body before Hidan could finish his ritual and heads to the Land of Fire Bounty Station to claim his 30 million. Hidan takes his Retractable Spear out of his torso, grimacing in pain, as he follows Kakuzu.\n\nBack at the waterfall, Yamato is in place using his Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads to suppress the Nine-Tails' chakra, should it ever leak. Kakashi is lying on a wooden bench fashioned by Yamato, reading his Icha Icha book. Naruto asks for a shortcut, even asking to create more shadow clones, but Kakashi tells him that there isn't any more space left on the bridge to create shadow clones. Yamato tells Naruto that he has exceeded their expectations, as it would normally take one six months to master leaf cutting while he perfected it in mere hours. Kakashi adds that even Sasuke took a few days to undergo his nature transformation so he could convert his chakra into lightning in order to use Chidori. Naruto states that Sasuke is the very person he needs to catch up to; grabbing wind of Naruto's determination, Kakashi instructs Yamato to create two more waterfalls and extend the bridge, allowing Naruto to create more multiple shadow clones in order to accelerate his training.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "74", "Episode Title": "Under_the_Starry_Sky", "Japanese Airdate": "4 September 2008", "episode synopsis text": "Tsunade deploys the Nij\u016b Sh\u014dtai, twenty teams composed of four ninja each, to deal with and exterminate the Akatsuki members in the Land of Fire.

Throwing a kunai with an explosive tag attached, Shikamaru tells him that the only god he needs to worry about is him, since he is the one who will be passing judgment. The explosive tag then ignites and causes the dismembered Hidan to be buried. Shikamaru's deer, Rikumaru, unearths Asuma's lighter, which Shikamaru appreciates. He then exits the woods, only to be found by Pakkun, Sakura and Sai, the former having been summoned by Kakashi to aid the two find Shikamaru. Sakura and Sai are surprised to find out that Shikamaru had managed to defeat an immortal Akatsuki member on his own, and the latter credits it due to him having a personal motive. With that, the four set off towards the clearing in order to provide Teams 10 and 7 with backup.\n\nAt the clearing, Ino remarks how she viewed Naruto differently for a few seconds until his jutsu dissipated, while Ch\u014dji remarks that based on the name \"Rasenshuriken\", he thought Naruto would have thrown it. Yamato clears up his confusion, stating that the techniques require a frontal attack. When Naruto decides to have another go, Ch\u014dji offers to back him up, with Kakashi stating that it would be for the better as they outnumber him by four; Naruto, however, brings up Kakashi's words about Naruto being the only shinobi who could surpass the Fourth Hokage and asks for another chance to go solo and prove his worth. Kakashi and Yamato grant Naruto the opportunity, and creating more shadow clones, Naruto prepares his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken once more.\n\nSeeing Naruto getting ready to attack. Kakuzu unleashes the full power of his Earth Grudge Fear ability and rushes towards the Naruto holding the Rasenshuriken, believing the others to be mere shadow clones that will be dispelled once the original dies. He impales Naruto and snuffs out the Rasenshuriken with his black threads, but is surprised when \"Naruto\" is dispelled, proving itself to be none other than a shadow clone. The real Naruto, along with two shadow clones, attack him from above with the Rasenshuriken; Kakuzu is surprised that Naruto hid amongst the shadow clones, and having no way to escape, is forced to take the brunt of the attack. The impact of the Rasenshuriken dispels both shadow clones and sends Naruto flying while propelling Kakuzu a few feet away in mid-air, the attack undoing his threads and bursting all of his hearts. With no more hearts or threads to maintain his body, Kakuzu falls to the ground, defeated. Meanwhile, Ch\u014dji, Ino, Yamato and Kakashi marvel at Naruto's success, with the latter being genuinely surprised that he was unable to track the Rasenshuriken's movements with his Sharingan and that Naruto was able to successfully master what he and the Fourth Hokage could not - combining their chakra nature with the Rasengan. \n"}, {"Episode Number": "89", "Episode Title": "The_Price_of_Power", "Japanese Airdate": "18 December 2008", "episode synopsis text": "Ino notices that Naruto has yet to stand up after using his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken and rushes over to heal him.

Team 7 and Team Asuma then return to Konoha to report to Tsunade, with Kakashi having brought back Kakuzu's corpse. Tsunade orders everyone to take a few days off to rest but places Naruto at the Konoha Hospital to have his arm wounds checked out.\n\nOn their way back home, Shikamaru decides to stop by at Asuma's grave, placing his lighter there. Kurenai is also there, and he tells Kurenai that Asuma was the best role model he ever had, and that he would like to be the same for their child, revealing Kurenai to be pregnant. Shikamaru then returns home, where he plays sh\u014dgi with his father Shikaku, with the former claiming that the latter is better at it than Asuma. While playing, Shikamaru asks his father if he knows who the \"king\" of Konoha is, and tells him that Asuma told him that it was the next generation of shinobi, who would bear the burden of the village's safety on their shoulders.\n\nAfter examining Kakuzu's corpse, Tsunade has Shizune summon Kakashi and Yamato to the coroner's office, where she tells them that Rasenshuriken is more like a poison, working on a microscopic level to cause cellular damage. She explains that Kakuzu's entire Chakra Pathway System had been severed and that Naruto has the same injuries to his right arm, albeit to a lesser degree. Tsunade adds that damage done to the cellular level cannot be treated by her medical ninjutsu and thus labels the technique a kinjutsu, asking Kakashi to make sure that Naruto understands that he is never to use the technique again, while Yamato muses that such a powerful technique does come with the associated risks.\n\nAt the hospital, Naruto thanks Sakura for taking care of him, although she attempts to convince him not to use the Rasenshuriken anymore unless as a last resort. He fails to understand why, claiming that she could heal his arm every time after, but she reminds him that even her medical ninjutsu can only heal so much. Naruto, however, adds that he prefers the path they are on right now, where the two of them are working together and getting powerful in order to catch up to Sasuke.\n\nElsewhere, Sasuke prepares his Chidori in front of dummy targets, although by partially activating his Cursed Seal of Heaven, he is able to slice the heads of the dummies without striking them physically with his Chidori. At the same time, Kabuto notifies Orochimaru that Naruto and his team had managed to kill both Hidan and Kakuzu, with Orochimaru being appreciative of the fact that they had spared Naruto's team after all and hoping that Naruto continues to thin the Akatsuki's ranks even further, going as far as mocking the Akatsuki for having lost two members in the same fight. However, he is also aware that they are in possession of the Two-Tails and thus asks Kabuto to fetch a woman named Guren for him, much to Kabuto's dismay.\n\nKabuto heads out to fetch Guren, a Crystal Release user, who attempts to strike at Kabuto using her Crystal Release: Crystal Needles as well as Crystal: Hexagonal Shuriken: Wild Dance. Kabuto uses his Chakra Scalpel to cut the hexagonal shuriken while berating Guren for attacking him; Guren, nonetheless, states that she believed it was an intruder and that if Kabuto was defeated by her attack, then he would not be worthy to be the right hand man of Orochimaru.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "90", "Episode Title": "A_Shinobi's_Determination", "Japanese Airdate": "25 December 2008", "episode synopsis text": "An Anbu member seemingly manages to locate the general area of Orochimaru's hideout and sends a message to Konoha to notify Tsunade, before eliminating all traces of his body.

Jiraiya enters through her window, telling Tsunade that he had popped in to see what Naruto was up to, and Tsunade fills him in on what he had missed.\n\nAt Ramen Ichiraku, Naruto struggles to eat his miso pork ramen with his dominant right arm in a cast and is nearly fed by Sakura, only for Sai to offer to feed him first, angering Naruto. Kakashi enters the restaurant and attempts to feed Naruto as well, much to the latter's irritation. Kakashi notices Naruto's upset mood and reminds him that he cannot use the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken again and that he considers Naruto his equal, and that Naruto would find a way to use much more powerful techniques. As they exit the shop, Naruto is confronted by Konohamaru, who has perfected the Shadow Clone Technique. With his shadow clones, Konohamaru shows Naruto his new Sexy: Girl on Girl Technique.

Inside Orochimaru's chambers, Orochimaru reveals that Guren was to be his candidate for a new body but due to time restraints, he was forced to choose Gen'y\u016bmaru. Orochimaru then reassures a worried Kabuto that Guren is the perfect woman for their upcoming task. Outside, Sasuke is practising his Chidori using the chakra from his Cursed Seal of Heaven. After finishing the technique, he is stunned when he realises he is being watched by a young boy named Y\u016bkimaru. Sasuke tells Y\u016bkimaru to go home, but Y\u016bkimaru tells him that he has no home and asks Sasuke if he has a home, to which the latter claims he does not. Before their conversation can carry any further, Kabuto comes to whisk Y\u016bkimaru away, apologising to Sasuke for the interruption.\n\nIn her office, Tsunade assigns Kakashi as the leader of a search team she had chosen to locate Orochimaru's hideout. Kakashi reads the file and tells her that he could not think of a better team for this mission. As he heads towards the front gate, the search team is revealed to be none other than Team 8. Shino tells Kakashi that he will use his parasitic insects to locate the enemies' chakra, after which Kiba states that he and Akamaru would be able to locate their scent; Hinata adds that her Byakugan will ensure that they locate the hideout. However, she mentions the fact that they may run into Sasuke at the hideout and inquires as to why Naruto is not coming along. Shino explains that Naruto would not be able to contain himself, a sentiment Kiba echoes, and Kakashi confirms that Naruto is being kept in the dark about this mission.\n\nAt the top near Hokage Rock, Naruto is saddened over the fact that his Rasenshuriken has a self-inflicting drawback. Jiraiya tells him to be proud of it, as he was able to master what even the Fourth Hokage could not, and subsequently tells Naruto that all he needs is more training, offering Naruto another chance to hit the road with him and train.

Hinata is able to tell that something is on Kiba's mind and Kiba relays his thoughts to them, although he quickly remarks that if Shikamaru and Naruto were able to take out two members of the Akatsuki, then he should be able to prove himself against one of Orochimaru's underlings. Shino also voices his desire to prove himself on a mission, and Kiba chalks it up to Shino's irritation of not being a member of the Sasuke Recovery Team. Shino explains that his disappointment is not just because he was not available to participate in the Sasuke Recovery Mission, but also because Naruto did not recognise him when he returned to Konoha. Privately, Hinata remarks on how she too wishes to prove herself so that Naruto may finally acknowledge her, while Kakashi reflects on how far the team has matured.\n\nBack at the hideout, Guren tells the survivors of the massacre to stop their slaughter and to follow her if they wish to live. At a spa, Jiraiya is shocked to find out that the bath is not a co-ed one and is stuck there with Naruto. Naruto sees the scar on Jiraiya's chest and recalls when he had wounded the sannin in his four-tailed form. Naruto expresses his frustration of how he does not want to use the Nine-Tails' power since it hurts those around him and how he wishes to find another way to gain strength. Jiraiya remarks that Naruto sounds like a veteran shinobi, and reminds him that he must heal his broken arm first.\n\nThe Orochimaru Search Team manage to track an enemy's scent to Orochimaru's hideout, where they find a man asking for help, riddled with Orochimaru's cursed seal, before he succumbs to his injuries and dies.

Before they can get answers, a timed trap is sprung. Though the team manages to evade it, all traces of Orochimaru's hideout, including the bodies, are eliminated.\n\nIn their hotel room, Jiraiya attempts to goad Naruto by calling him weak, but is surprised when Naruto simply smiles and takes it in stride. Remembering Naruto's desire to save Sasuke three years ago and how Naruto felt the same way he did when he was unable to prevent Orochimaru's desertion, Jiraiya asks whether Naruto still feels the same way. After realising that Naruto is still adamant on rescuing Sasuke, Jiraiya decides that Naruto should learn a new technique.\n\nAfter escaping the trap, Shino and Kiba manage to pick up the scent of whomever set the trap. Meanwhile, Guren, along with her twenty-one followers, set off towards Orochimaru, only for sixteen of them to revolt and try to kill her. She easily defeats all sixteen of them with her Crystal Release: Crystal Pentagonal Prison technique. The other five then pledge their loyalty to Guren, and now with her newfound team, she sets off. Team 8 manages to track Guren's scent all the way to a meadow, where they are shocked to find people encased in crystal, which then disintegrates, killing the people trapped within. Shino's bugs are encased as well, and Kakashi is stunned to realise that it is none other than Crystal Release.\n\nIn a clearing, Jiraiya asks Naruto whether he remembers their last training session, which involved toads. Naruto remembers and claims that he does not want to do that again, but Jiraiya claims he is now ready for it. He explains that Naruto would be learning a Cooperation Ninjutsu, citing his Fire Release: Flame Bullet and Gamabunta's Toad Oil Bullet as an example, as both their moves combined creates the more powerful Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet technique. Naruto tells Jiraiya that he had done something similar to Yamato, when the captain had combined his Water Release: Tearing Torrent and Naruto's Wind Release: Rasengan to create the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique. Upon realising that Naruto has aided in a cooperation technique before, he claims that Naruto should be able to do the same with a toad, and proceeds to summon Gamariki, a flamboyant toad who dislikes Naruto. Naruto asks Jiraiya why he can't create a cooperation technique with him, and Jiraiya reminds him that he may not always be there, but that he can always summon toads. Jiraiya then demonstrates to Naruto of using a collaboration technique by sending his chakra into Gamariki to power up his Water Release: Water Gun. Naruto, impressed by this, is told by Jiraiya that his Wind Release should cause him to create an even more powerful version of that technique. However, he is stumped as both Naruto and Gamariki find themselves unable to work or get along with one another.\n\nMeanwhile, Orochimaru summons Sasuke to his chambers where he announces his desire to test Sasuke's strength, and remarks that he does not detect a flicker of fear from Sasuke.

The chakra begins to draw out a beast hiding underneath the lake, but Y\u016bkimaru passes out due to exertion before the beast is summoned. Kabuto remarks that Y\u016bkimaru is truly useful to Orochimaru and is content with having located the beast.\n\nIn the woods, Kakashi summons Pakkun. After placing one of the crystals in Pakkun's bandaged paw, he alerts Pakkun that the crystal has one of Shino's bugs encased inside and that it was caused by one of Orochimaru's followers, and asks the hound to bring the crystal to Konoha and relay the situation to Tsunade. Meanwhile, Guren leaves her subordinates at a deserted ruins and tells them to stay put as she heads off towards Orochimaru's hideout.\n\nNaruto is attempting to perfect his coordination with Gamariki but the friction between the pair causes the two of them to land in the hot spring where Jiraiya was soaking and attempting to peep at the women. The impact of their fall washes out the water, much to the sannin's dismay, as the women exit the springs. Jiraiya berates Gamariki and Naruto, and Naruto states that they are not compatible. He asks to use toads that he is compatible with, but Jiraiya tells him that while his idea is a good one, he is unable to summon with his right arm in a cast. Naruto, grinning, reminds Jiraiya that he has underestimated his healing ability and proceeds to break the cast off and use his summoning technique, calling on both Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, who have now grown much larger.\n\nOn the way to Orochimaru's hideout, Guren spots her master and Sasuke himself. She recalls when she rushed into his lair to give her body up for Orochimaru to use as his vessel, only for Kabuto to tell her that she was too late and that Orochimaru had chosen Gen'y\u016bmaru, and that Sasuke was to be his next vessel. Angered at what Sasuke has that she does not, she follows the pair to the edge of the woods, where Orochimaru tells Sasuke that he is now going to prove his strength in a battle; however, his opponent is not Orochimaru, but thousands of armed shinobi. Nonetheless, Orochimaru detects no fear in Sasuke's eyes and Sasuke engages against his opponents with his sword in tow.\n\nOn the cliff top, Naruto is floored at Gamakichi and Gamatatsu's cooperation ninjutsu training, which seems to consist of dance moves and the toads leaping around eating flies. Meanwhile, Sasuke manages to defeat all of his foes without a fatal blow to them. Orochimaru reminds Sasuke that he must be heartless and kill his opponents, but Sasuke retorts that he will be heartless when he kills Itachi. Orochimaru marvels at the sight of Sasuke, as he defeated thousands of opponents without a single drop of blood, and remarks how he was considered a genius in his time but that his prowess does not compare to that of Sasuke's. As Sasuke walks out of the woods, he passes by Guren. The latter is approached by Orochimaru, who asks her whether it is still her dream to be his vessel. When she confirms it, he tells her that he has a special mission for her that only she can complete, and that if she succeeds, he may reconsider choosing her as his next vessel.\n\nOn their walk back to the hideout, Kabuto notices that Y\u016bkimaru is exhausted and needs rest, and stops at a hot springs, which happens to be the same one Naruto and Jiraiya are at. In the springs, Naruto mentions out loud how the toads' training does not cause him to see what's truly in their hearts and souls. Y\u016bkimaru shocks Naruto with his appearance and asks the genin if what he remarked out loud was true. Naruto reaffirms his comment, and tells Y\u016bkimaru that home is where the person who is always on your mind is. As Y\u016bkimaru praises Naruto for his wisdom, Naruto claims that he knows a lot of things; Y\u016bkimaru then disappears, leaving a stunned Naruto to wonder where he went, noticing a single white flower left behind.\n\nIn a cave, Kiba is restless as the Orochimaru Search Team is resting. Shino reminds him that they must wait for his insects to locate the enemy and that they might as well rest while they have the chance. In the meantime, Pakkun reaches Konoha with the message from Kakashi, although he asks for some water first before relaying it. In the hot springs, Gamatatsu and Gamakichi use a shrinking technique to enter the water, although Gamatatsu undoes the technique, causing his weight and momentum to drain the water, chasing the women out once more.

Rinji remarks how Gozu was strong enough to survive the massacre on his own while the others formed alliances and invites him to join their team as a full-fledged member. Rinji then sets out on patrol, where he sees the bat flying above. The bat lands on his arm and uses its ultrasonic mind waves to transmit what it has seen. Knowing that there are enemies out there, Rinji orders the bat to relay a message for him. He is then approached by Gozu, who wishes to go out on patrol with him.

However, Gamatatsu refuses to participate in the training unless he is given snacks, and Naruto gives Gama-chan, his purse, to Konohamaru and asks the latter to buy some snacks.

Nurari is able to evade the technique as Kigiri uses his Destroying Smell Smoke Prison to create a thick smokescreen to rob Kiba and Akamaru of their sense of sight and smell.\n\nNurari attempts to finish the blinded Kiba off, but he is saved by Hinata, who tells Kiba to deal with the others as she deals with Nurari. Nurari is shocked when he realises that Hinata can see him, but is reassured when Hinata's Gentle Fist attacks are unable to harm him. In the meantime, Kakashi continues to fight against Gozu. Using a shadow clone to trick Gozu, Kakashi believes he has the upper hand, but Gozu is able to move at enhanced speed to elude the real Kakashi and proceeds to sneak up behind him and kick him with enough force to destroy a free. Pushed to his limit, Kakashi is forced to use his Sharingan and manages to evade one of Gozu's attacks. He prepares a Lightning Cutter but finds himself unable to pinpoint an opening.\n\nUsing his Slime Suit, Nurari is able to avoid being stuck directly by Hinata's Gentle Fist and he proceeds to attack her. Before she can be finished off, she is saved by Kiba and Akamaru, who uses their Fang Passing Fang through the air and trees to create a windstorm to dispel the smokescreen. With his sense of smell and sight restored, Kiba proudly exclaims that he would be able to handle Nurari before being struck by poison gas emitted from Kih\u014d's Wrist Launcher. Kiba berates himself for being stupid enough to forget that there are other enemies, but before Team Guren can finish the three off, Rinji senses something surrounding them. Deeming it dangerous, he orders the group to retreat. Kiba's confusion over the matter is absolved when he is greeted by Shino, who explains that he was casting a trap around them before Rinji's acute senses picked up on it. Kakashi also stumbles in on them; Kiba asks whether he dealt with Gozu and Kakashi states that he was unable to, although he managed to use his Lightning Cutter to give Gozu a serious arm wound. \n\nKakashi tells them that their fight is far from over and that their enemies are still out there; unbeknownst to him, the entire battle was being watched by Guren via a crystal ball, who is surprised that Kakashi the Copy Ninja was sent to pursue her.

However, once he finds himself secluded, he attempts to continue his training in secret until he notices a light mist settling in and spots Y\u016bkimaru, the young boy he had met at the hot springs. Y\u016bkimaru is cryptic, but after Naruto reaffirms that the people who are thinking about you is where your home is, Y\u016bkimaru disappears, along with the mist.

Guren and her clones arrive to deal with Team 8, generating jade crystal blades from her forearms. Kakashi uncovers his Sharingan to give him an edge, but Guren reveals that her Crystal Release cannot be copied. Elsewhere, Hinata manages to defeat one of the clones with her Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms, though she is encased within a jade crystal prison by another crystal clone. The other crystal clones stop their fight with their respective opponents in order to lure them into a clearing, where Guren warns them that should they interfere any further, the confined Hinata would disintegrate into shards.\n\nOn the outside, Team Yamato finds themselves unable to break through the crystal labyrinth.

Confident that his new technique would do the trick, Naruto summons Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, surprising Sakura and Sai, with the latter asking when he had learned such an impressive technique.

As she uses the crystal dragon to attack the Orochimaru Search Team, Sai uses his ink bird to distract Guren while Naruto has Gamatatsu swallow the crystal-confined Hinata in order to take away Guren's leverage.

However, Hinata's crystal shatters, although Hinata survives. Hinata explains to the group that she began to emit chakra from all of her chakra points before she was crystallised, notifying Kakashi that Guren's Crystal Release is unable to crystallise chakra.

In the meantime, the rest of the search team continues to travel through the woods, with Naruto expressing his annoyance of avoiding bats. Shino proposes that they use the bats to find their enemies, as the bats are awaiting their detection before returning to their master. Although Naruto does not understand the plan, Kakashi asks him to create three shadow clones and have them run throughout the woods. Naruto complies, although he wonders why he did so as the bats have detected his clones. Kiba explains that once the bats detect his shadow clones, they would fly back to their master, and that the team would simply follow the bats to find their enemies' hideout.

Naruto reveals to Guren that he is responsible for Y\u016bkimaru's attitude towards her, but that was only because he did not know he would consider a subordinate of Orochimaru's as his home. Guren retorts by stating that Orochimaru has need for one who could control a tailed beast and that Konoha is hypocritical, as they already possess the power of the Nine-Tails via a jinch\u016briki and simply want Y\u016bkimaru to increase their military power. Naruto tells her that Konoha has no need for the Three-Tails and surprises Guren by telling her that he is the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails. Although Guren is conflicted with her loyalty towards Orochimaru, she tells Naruto that Y\u016bkimaru is the one who thinks of her and therefore he is the one she would return to. Naruto, filled with a resolve that they both escape together, explains that they should split up to cover more ground as they need to find a way out.

Hiruzen had told him that the white snake's skin was rare and that it was renown as a sign of good luck and renewal, possibly meaning that his parents may be reborn someday. Years later, during a mission, he witnessed Tsunade's brother Nawaki dying and remarked that the lifespan and vulnerability of humans were weaknesses, and eventually began seeking out a reanimation technique.\n\nSome time later, he had gained Anko as an apprentice, who had noticed the white snake skin Orochimaru had kept. He had told her that he was experimenting not only with reanimation but also with regeneration. During this time, he also witnessed Itachi Uchiha's prowess with the Sharingan and began to covet the power of the Uchiha clan's kekkei genkai. Soon after finding various scrolls in a tome, he had realised that there was no way one could learn and master all the forbidden techniques in a single lifespan and thus focused on mastering the Living Corpse Reincarnation technique in an attempt to gain immortality. However, he had later been caught doing experiments with the dead by the Third Hokage, and thus fled Konoha, although not before engaging in a battle with his old teammate Jiraiya.\n\nAfter having escaped from Jiraiya, Orochimaru had joined the criminal organisation known as the Akatsuki and was pleasantly surprised to have learned that their new member and his partner was none other than Itachi himself. He had then attempted to use his transference technique in an attempt to steal Itachi's body, only for Itachi to effortlessly trap him in a genjutsu with his Sharingan.

He had repeated Itachi's words to Orochimaru on how his Sharingan was able to see through any of his techniques, and proceeded to absorb Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto is shocked to discover that Orochimaru is now effectively gone, while Sasuke triumphantly leaves the hideout with a smirk on his face.\n\nIn Konoha, Naruto, Tsunade and Jiraiya notice the blood red sunset and consider it a bad omen; while on a mission, Anko hears a rustling sound and throws a kunai in its direction, only to pin and kill a white snake.

J\u016bgo claims that he cannot leave the Northern Hideout without Kimimaro and continues to attack Sasuke. It turns out that in the past, it was Kimimaro who had recruited J\u016bgo to join Orochimaru and had promised to restrain J\u016bgo's murderous impulses with his Shikotsumyaku acting as a cage. Suigetsu arrives, and is told by Karin that J\u016bgo is bipolar and relied on Kimimaro to help him, and thus had joined Orochimaru willingly in order to find a way to repress his urges. As Sasuke attempts to avoid J\u016bgo's attacks, Suigetsu interferes, blocking the strike with his Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d. J\u016bgo retaliates with his Destroying Axe Fist but the pair are stopped by Sasuke's Binding Snake Glare Spell, asking them if they both wish to die.\n\nThe restraint causes J\u016bgo to revert back to normal and he rushes into his cell, asking Sasuke to lock the door and leave, as he does not want to kill people anymore. Sasuke tells J\u016bgo that he would not kill people as he would protect J\u016bgo and act as his cage, mirroring Kimimaro's words. When J\u016bgo reminds Sasuke that he cannot leave without Kimimaro, Sasuke tells him that Kimimaro had died for him. J\u016bgo then recalls the last time he had seen Kimimaro, when the latter told him that he was heading to retrieve Sasuke, who was to be Orochimaru's vessel. As only he and Sasuke were considered to be Orochimaru's prime host bodies, Kimimaro told J\u016bgo that he considered Sasuke as his \"reincarnation\". J\u016bgo then opens his cell door and exits. Outside, Sasuke tells them that his goal is to murder Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki and that they are to help him reach his goal. However, he offers them all the choice to join him. Karin tells Sasuke that she has nothing else to do, while Suigetsu chides her for hiding her true feelings about wanting to be around Sasuke; however, he too agrees to join as he wishes to fight Kisame Hoshigaki and claim his Samehada. J\u016bgo joins the team as well, wanting to see what kind of shinobi Sasuke is, as his best friend Kimimaro considered Sasuke his \"reincarnation\". Sasuke then dubs their team as \"Hebi\".\n\nIn Konoha, Jiraiya tells Naruto that Sasuke would not be returning to the village as his goal is still to exact vengeance upon Itachi.

In order to celebrate Kakashi's promotion, Minato gives Kakashi a Flying Thunder God Kunai while Rin gives him a specially made medic-kit. Obito, however, has forgotten to bring a gift for Kakashi and is vexed when Kakashi states that it would have been useless anyways.\n\nMinato tells them that as they are involved in a war, Iwagakure has invaded Kusagakure near the Land of Fire and that Kakashi's team are to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in order to cripple their efforts. Meanwhile, he would engage in combat in the front lines in order to provide a suitable distraction. On their way, Kakashi spots Mahiru, an Iwa-nin who is conducting surveillance. Minato notices that Mahiru has employed about twenty shadow clones while Kakashi tells him that he has a new technique that should be able to deal with them all. With his Chidori, Kakashi plows through the shadow clones and rushes towards the real Mahiru; however, Kakashi's Chidori causes him to have tunnel vision and thus does not see Mahiru pull out a sword. Before Mahiru can kill Kakashi, Minato manages to save him from the blow whilst simultaneously marking Mahiru's foot, although Kakashi ends up being slashed near his underarm. \n\nAs Rin tends to Kakashi's wounds, Minato uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to appear before Mahiru, placing a kunai next to the Iwa-nin's throat. Mahiru expresses his regret for recognising Minato as the famed \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\" and for not retreating as per Iwagakure's rules; Minato then kills Mahiru. As they camp that night, Obito expresses his displeasure of being a failure from the elite Uchiha Clan while having to deal with Kakashi's genius. Minato reveals that Kakashi is the way he is because his father Sakumo, who was known as the \"Konoha's White Fang\", had once broken the law by choosing to save the lives of his comrades over completing the mission and was thus vilified by both the village and the very friends he had saved. Unable to cope, Sakumo took his own life. Since then, Kakashi had chosen never to speak of his father and vowed to uphold the rules and regulations of the shinobi world.\n\nThe following morning, Minato sets off on his own mission while Obito decides to pledge his loyalty to his new captain, Kakashi, much to the team's surprise. On their way to the bridge, they are spotted by two enemies from Iwa. While one of them distracts Kakashi and Obito, the other uses a camouflage technique to abduct Rin. Obito claims that they should go and save Rin, only for Kakashi to remind him that the law is to complete the mission even at the expense of their comrades, and that they should not let emotions cloud their judgment. Obito declares that he will not follow Kakashi's orders, and as he walks away, he tells Kakashi that he personally views the White Fang as a hero; he also adds that while shinobi who break the rules are considered scum, those who abandon their friends are worse than scum. The duo then part their separate ways.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "120", "Episode Title": "Kakashi_Chronicles_~_Boys'_Life_on_the_Battlefield_~_Part_2", "Japanese Airdate": "30 July 2009", "episode synopsis text": "As Kakashi heads through the woods to Kannabi Bridge, he flinches in pain from his wound.

Taiseki decides to deal with Obito while Kakk\u014d continues using his Interrogation Genjutsu on Rin in an attempt to break her. Using his Hiding with Camouflage Technique, Taiseki sneaks up on Obito and prepares to kill him with a kunai, only for Kakashi to interfere and slash at Taiseki with his White Light Chakra Sabre. Seeing the sabre and the white hair, he wonders whether Kakashi is the Konoha's famed \"White Fang\", only to realise that he is just his son. As Obito questions why Kakashi would come and save him, Taiseki uses his camouflage technique once more and sneaks up on Obito; Kakashi attempts to save him but ends up getting his left eye slashed. As Kakashi reels in pain, Taiseki rushes towards Obito, only for Obito to turn around and stab him with a kunai. Kakashi and Taiseki wonder how Obito was able to see the latter, and Obito realises that he has finally awoken his Sharingan. Using the med-kit given by Rin, Kakashi bandages his left eye and the two head inside the cave to save Rin.\n\nInside the cave, Obito is able to use his Sharingan to keep up with Kakashi and avoid being struck by Kakk\u014d, and the duo manage to defeat him. As they rush to free Rin, Kakk\u014d uses the opportunity to cause a cave-in. As Team Minato attempt to run out of the cave, Kakashi is struck by a falling rock. Obito picks Kakashi up and notices a big boulder above their head, and throws Kakashi out of the way, taking the brunt of the boulder's impact on himself. As Kakashi and Rin come to, they discover Obito pinned underneath the boulder, the entire left side of his body crushed. Kakashi begins to cry, as he believes he could have prevented this had he chosen to follow Obito at the beginning and that it did not matter that he was j\u014dnin and thus captain of the team. Remembering that he had not given Kakashi a gift for his promotion, he asks Rin to transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi's left eye socket. With the transplant completed, Kakashi rushes outside the cave and uses his White Light Chakra Sabre to attack Kakk\u014d. As Kakk\u014d destroys the blade, Kakashi uses his Chidori to strike the Iwa-nin and kills him. As the other Iwa-nin arrive, one of them uses his Earth Release: Tearing Earth Turning Palm cause the entire cave to collapse; Kakashi escapes with Rin as Obito is buried in the rubble, where he muses in his last moments that he is saddened to die right when he and Kakashi had finally begun to get along and that he never told Rin that he loved her. Outside, Kakashi and Rin are ambushed by the surrounding Iwa-nin, and Kakashi tells Rin to flee while he fights them off, as he had promised Obito that he would protect Rin with his life. Kakashi tells Rin that Obito had loved her and that she was everything to him, as Rin attempts to tell Kakashi that she has feelings for him. As Kakashi prepares his Chidori, they are saved by the arrival of Minato, who uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to defeat all of their enemies.\n\nAs he comes to, Kakashi asks how Minato had arrived to save them and Minato reveals that the marking on the Flying Thunder God Kunai he had given Kakashi allows him to teleport to that location; he also adds that Rin had told him what had transpired.

Itachi tells Kisame that they are to head to the hideout immediately so that they can begin sealing both the Three-Tails and the Four-Tails. As they reach the woods, they are both telepathically summoned to their leader's hideout.\n\nAt the hideout, their leader summons the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the surviving members take their respective places. Before they begin the sealing process, the leader and Zetsu notify the Akatsuki members that Orochimaru has been killed. Deidara voices his discomfort over the news, as he wanted to be the one to kill the sannin. Kisame claims that Orochimaru's death is not their concern as he left the Akatsuki ten years ago, and that he himself did not care for the deaths of Hidan and Kakuzu, and wonders who finished them off. Zetsu tells them that it was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki and his team who defeated Kakuzu and Hidan and that it was Sasuke Uchiha who killed Orochimaru. The leader also adds his fear that Sasuke may wage war against the entirety of the Akatsuki soon, while Zetsu notifies them that Sasuke has formed a team, whose members include Suigetsu H\u014dzuki of Kirigakure. Knowing that Sasuke is after Itachi and that Suigetsu is after Kisame, the leader tells the pair to be on their guard; they then begin the sealing process of the two tailed beasts in their possession.\n\nAfter the sealing process is complete, Deidara contemplates who his target shall be, claiming that he wishes to settle the score with Naruto for punching him in the face as well as Kakashi for having removed his right arm, and that he wishes to take out Sasuke as punishment for robbing him of the chance of eliminating Orochimaru. Meanwhile, Sasuke's team Hebi make their way to an Uchiha Clan munitions base, run by an old woman who goes by Nekobaa. Nekobaa expresses her thoughts over Sasuke and Itachi fighting each other to the death, as she had known both of them since they were young.\n\nIn Konoha, Tsunade contemplates Naruto's idea to apprehend Itachi in order to bring Sasuke back to the village.

Unbeknownst to her, Sakura is in the same village, with Bisuke and Shiba managing to locate Sasuke's scent, which is coming from Karin. However, Karin and Sakura pass each other and the scent is lost. Naruto, Yamato and Hinata are ambushed by Kabuto, who gives them Orochimaru's gathered intelligence on the Akatsuki. When asked why he would give up such a thing, Kabuto tells Naruto that he is grateful towards him; ever since Kabuto was a child, he was used as a spy and thus moved from village to village until he became Orochimaru's subordinate. After Orochimaru had died, he felt as though he had lost his purpose and identity until he realised that Naruto had forged his own identity when the villagers thought he was no more than a human variant of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Kabuto reveals the left side of his body to the trio, which resembles Orochimaru, and explains that he had grafted portions of Orochimaru's corpse onto himself as a way of clinging to his dead master and that he plans to avenge Orochimaru by eliminating Sasuke. With that said, Kabuto flees, evading capture.\n\nIn a clearing, Sasuke senses Tobi's presence and notices Deidara flying above him, the latter dropping two C1 bombs on him.

Using his sword, Sasuke rushes at Deidara and Tobi; Deidara leaps on a tree branch to evade the attack while Tobi is sliced through, although he is unharmed by the attack. Using his explosive clay to create C1 clay spiders, he attacks Sasuke, who uses his Chidori Senbon to take out the spiders. Deidara then ups the ante by using Explosive Clay Dolls. Sasuke attempts to impale them with his sword, only for the sword to get stuck. Relying on taijutsu for a while, Sasuke applies his Lightning Release to his sword to slice through both clay dolls. However, the bisected dolls begin to reemerge as smaller versions, all of them chasing Sasuke through the forest. As they envelop Sasuke, Deidara detonates them, but Sasuke evades the blow with a Body Replacement Technique.\n\nDeidara decides to use his C2 and moulds his C2 Clay Dragon, regurgitating C2 landmines and taking flight. In an attempt to ground the bird, Sasuke attempts to impale it with his Chidori Sharp Spear, only to be out of range whilst simultaneously revealing its five metre limit to Deidara. Deidara accuses Sasuke of using Kakashi's technique, although he gives credit for the shape transformation Sasuke had applied to it. Tobi, under Deidara's command, places Explosive Landmines all around the ground while the C2 dragon fires clay missiles towards Sasuke, forcing the latter to enter into the second stage of his cursed seal in order to use the wings it grants to fly away from danger. \n\nNoticing that Sasuke's leg seems injured, Deidara fires another projectile missile at Sasuke, who uses his left wing to shield himself from it, albeit losing the wing in the process. Seeing as Sasuke is unable to fly without his wing, Deidara lowers his altitude slightly while Sasuke uses the Manipulated Shuriken Technique to throw two giant shuriken at him, who dodges it. Throwing his sword with precise accuracy to impale the ground, Sasuke uses it as a foothold and then leaps into the air, using the height gained to further the reach of his Chidori Sharp Spear, successfully slicing Deidara's C2 Clay Dragon in two. Pulling the wire threads he had used to manipulate the two shuriken, Sasuke impales both of Deidara's forearms, pinning him to the dragon which then explodes.\n\nDeidara survives the explosion, having created a clay bird, and glares at Sasuke and his Sharingan. He recalls when he was coerced into joining the Akatsuki by Itachi, and how he had developed a hatred for both the Sharingan and Itachi since. Deidara then uses the most powerful clay in his arsenal, the C4, and fashions it into a giant clay version of himself, while musing that his original intention was to use the C4 Karura to kill Itachi.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "124", "Episode Title": "Art", "Japanese Airdate": "27 August 2009", "episode synopsis text": "Unleashing his C4 Karura, Deidara unleashes miniature nano-sized explosive clay bombs that disintegrate cells from within, thus instantly killing the individual. He believes that he has killed Sasuke in that manner, only for Sasuke to have used Genjutsu: Sharingan to trick Deidara. Having entered into the second stage of his cursed seal, Sasuke strikes Deidara from behind with his Chidori, intentionally missing Deidara's vital spots in order to question him about Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara inquires as to how Sasuke had evaded the attack, Sasuke reveals that his Sharingan sees chakra as colours and thus was able to see the nano-bombs.\n\nHowever, the Deidara Sasuke has in his grip is none other than a Clay Clone, while the real Deidara pops out of the clay bird and holds Sasuke's feet. Using his mouth to create another C4 Karura, Deidara has Sasuke trapped inside while leaping off the bird. Sasuke uses his Chidori to escape the Karura, although the C4 nano-bombs are already within Sasuke's system; Deidara then denotaes the C4, believing he has finally killed Sasuke.\n\nSasuke, nonetheless, survives the attack and punches Deidara, demanding to know Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara questions how he had survived, Sasuke explains that he had seen Deidara's hand signs with his Sharingan and thus realised it was an Earth Release technique, which is vulnerable to Lightning Release. Sasuke reveals that he had tested the theory out when he had struck Deidara's clay spiders with his Chidori Senbon; however, due to Tobi being near the spiders' range, he was not sure whether it was his attack or Deidara that had prevented the spiders' detonation. Hence, he had tried it once more when he had infused his Chidori into his sword to pierce a landmine, which was not under Deidara's control. When the landmine did not explode, Sasuke's theory was confirmed, and thus he had struck himself with his own Chidori to disable the nano-bombs in his system; he also takes the opportunity to correct Deidara by telling him that he uses the Chidori, not the Lightning Cutter, which Deidara had been referring to it as during their battle. Along with that, he also reveals even if it didn't work, he has another hidden technique to be used, leaving Deidara in begrudging shock of Sasuke's abilities.\n\nHowever, Sasuke has ran out of chakra and collapses after negating a surprise attack from Deidara, who delightfully laughs as he still has some Explosive Clay left and declares this fight as his but is left incensed that Sasuke remains unworried. His composure utterly broken, Deidara shouts on how he despises Sasuke and Itachi for their cool and calm demeanour and how they used their dojutsu to just so easily handle and judge his art, which doesn't faze Sasuke, who simply asks him where Itachi is and even went as far as to deactivate his Sharingan, leaving Deidara even more furious. Deidara proceeds to pull his shirt off and uses the teeth in his palm to pull apart strings located above his heart, revealing another mouth. Ingesting his C0 clay, Deidara decides to detonate himself, telling Sasuke that the range of his attack goes up to 10 kilometres and that both he and Sasuke would die as a result, taking gleeful joy that while he would be remembered for his explosive art, which would cause a crater in the very earth itself, Sasuke would be forgotten.

Zetsu reports this to the other Akatsuki members and the Akatsuki leader asks them to mourn. Kisame expresses that while he misses Tobi, at least Deidara had taken Sasuke out with him. As the other members leave, Itachi walks outside in the rain, where Kisame states that it looks like Itachi is crying, and offers his condolences regarding Sasuke's demise. Itachi, however, tells Kisame that Sasuke is still alive.\n\nSuigetsu, noticing that the snake on a scroll Sasuke had given him has disappeared, uses a drop of Sasuke's blood he has on his person to summon Manda, one of Orochimaru's snakes. Sasuke exits from the snake, revealing that he had summoned Manda and had jumped inside of it to escape Deidara's blast radius, although they both got hit before teleporting away. Manda curses Sasuke with his dying breath for using his Sharingan to control him and use him as a shield.

Tsunade reminds Jiraiya how their sensei, the Third Hokage, had wanted Jiraiya to succeed him as the Fourth only for Jiraiya to refuse, and how Jiraiya felt despair after being unable to prevent Orochimaru's decline into darkness, hence why he had monitored his old teammate's activities for years. Jiraiya replies spitefully that he does not need to worry about that no more and Tsunade muses on how she never thought Orochimaru would die.

Tsunade retorts that Jiraiya has the very same expectations for Naruto, having taught him the Rasengan. Jiraiya explains that he only did it for nostalgic purposes as Naruto reminds him of his student Minato Namikaze, who became the Fourth Hokage. Tsunade muses how Naruto reminds her of his father Minato due to their looks, but that his personality is more akin to his mother Kushina Uzumaki, a kunoichi from Uzushiogakure.

Following the battle, the Sannin notice that they are being followed by a trio of orphans, consisting of Yahiko, Konan and Nagato. Though Orochimaru suggests killing them to put them out of their misery, Jiraiya decides to stay behind in Ame with the three until they are strong enough to fend for themselves. While working on his novel at their hideout, Konan rushes in to notify Jiraiya that something terrible has happened to Yahiko and Nagato. When Jiraiya arrives, he sees a dead ch\u016bnin from Iwagakure, who had been murdered by Nagato after attacking Yahiko. Jiraiya wonders how Nagato managed to kill a ch\u016bnin without even knowing ninjutsu and is shocked to see that Nagato wields the Rinnegan, a mythical d\u014djutsu wielded by the Sage of Six Paths, which is said to have the power to either stabilise the world or annihilate it. Believing that Nagato might be the Child of the Prophecy, Jiraiya trains the three in ninjutsu for the next three years while also writing his first novel.\n\nAfter Yahiko, Nagato and Konan manage to defeat Jiraiya's shadow clone, he leaves them and returns to Konoha, confident that they are now able to handle themselves. As the war is still raging, the Sannin continue to gain victories in battles against numerous opponents, using their Summoning Technique to call forth Manda, Katsuyu and Gamabunta. After one such battle, Jiraiya is notified by a toad that the three Ame orphans have died, prompting him to reconsider whether the decisions he has made throughout his life were correct. Eventually, the Third Shinobi World War comes to an end due to the actions of another one of Jiraiya's pupils \u2014 Minato Namikaze. Sometime after, Minato reads Jiraiya's novel, The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi, and asks Jiraiya for permission to name his unborn son after the protagonist of the story, Naruto, a name which his wife Kushina Uzumaki likes.

He attempts to ask her of the whereabouts of Ame's leader, Hanz\u014d, only for Tezuna to tell Jiraiya that Hanz\u014d is not around anymore and that their village is ruled by Lord Pain. Using his Summoning: Toad Shop Technique, Jiraiya lures Tezuna's husband Ry\u016bsui and his partner Y\u016bdachi into what they believe is a bar, which in actuality is the stomach of a toad. Trapped within the amphibian, Jiraiya attempts to extract information from them; when Y\u016bdachi refuses, turns him into a frog.\n\nThreatening Ry\u016bsui with the same fate, Ry\u016bsui reveals that Hanz\u014d, the previous leader, had been killed by Pain himself.

Jiraiya claims that Naruto would need the key someday, while Gerotora reminds Jiraiya that the last time Jiraiya had convinced him to loosen Naruto's seal, Naruto had entered into his four-tailed form and succumbed to the Nine-Tails' influence, nearly killing Jiraiya. Jiraiya retorts that Naruto's father Minato, the Fourth Hokage himself, had sealed the Nine-Tails into Naruto for a reason and entrusted him with the key, in the belief that Naruto would one day be able to control that power. He adds that he believes that the Nine-Tails' attack that happened fifteen years prior was no accident, and that he believes it was manually summoned, like Madara Uchiha once did in the elder days.\n\nJiraiya proceeds to exit the belly of the frog while masquerading as Ry\u016bsui, unaware that he is being observed by Konan.

Since Fukasaku was able to deduce that the three Paths shared the same vision through their Rinnegan eyes, Jiraiya has the toads lure them with their genjutsu, which involves croaking frog sounds that reveal their location to Pain.

Sasuke wonders why Itachi would have done such a thing, and Tobi replies that he knows many things about Itachi that Sasuke does not, including the fact that Itachi was trying to protect Sasuke.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "140", "Episode Title": "Fate", "Japanese Airdate": "17 December 2009", "episode synopsis text": "Sasuke finds it hard to believe that Itachi was protecting him, telling Tobi that Itachi was the one who murdered their clan. Tobi tells Sasuke that Itachi did not cause the massacre single-handedly, revealing that he helped and that he is none other than Madara Uchiha. He asks Sasuke to remember the memories of his brother when he was younger, causing Sasuke to remember talking to Itachi when they were younger as to why the crest of the Konoha Military Police Force bore the insignia of their clan. Unable to process the information, Sasuke lashes out at Madara and passes out soon after.\n\nAs he wakes up, Sasuke finds himself bound. Madara tells Sasuke that Itachi's fate is linked to the events of the Warring States Period as Itachi's decision to murder their clan was in actuality a mission given to him by the higher-ups in Konoha, and that it is a tale that he believes Sasuke should know; he adds that Itachi had passed down his Amaterasu to prevent Sasuke from hearing the story. Sasuke agrees to listen, and Madara begins his tale. Back during the era of the Warring States, where many villages attacked one another in an attempt to increase their borders or military strength, two clans stood out as the most powerful clans \u2014 the Uchiha clan and the Senju Clan. The Senju clan was led by Hashirama Senju, whom Madara had fought many times. One day, after a long time of fighting, both the Uchiha clan and the Senju came to a peace treaty, with only Madara being against it. However, as leader of the clan, Madara went along with the clan's wishes and together they formed Konohagakure.\n\nHowever, when it came time to choose the Hokage who would rule the village, Hashirama was chosen, leaving Madara incensed that he was not. He attempted to convince the Uchiha clan to protest the Senju government, but was shunned by his own clan for wanting to start another conflict; to make matters worse, the clan believed that he had killed his own younger brother and had stolen his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan, with Madara revealing to Sasuke that his brother had given them willingly. In an attempt to get revenge on the village, Madara fought with Hashirama using the Nine-Tailed Fox at what would later become known as the Valley of the End. Many shinobi, Hashirama included, believed Madara had died during that final conflict.\n\nOver time, Hashirama's younger brother Tobirama Senju was chosen to be the Second Hokage, and as an act of \"trust\" towards the Uchiha clan, he had delegated all of them to the police force, thus barring them from high-ranking positions within the Senju government. Some of the Uchiha clansmen began to inherit Madara's will and ideology and did not like the idea of being the Senju's lackeys. Nonetheless, the Uchiha clan did nothing about it until sixteen years prior, when the Nine-Tails attacked Konoha. Since the Sharingan is able to control the tailed beast, the government had placed the Uchiha clan under suspicion of the attack and had forced them to relocate on the outskirts of the village. Thus, the Uchiha clan began to plan a coup d'\u00e9tat in order to overthrow the Senju government. Madara reveals that except for the Third Hokage, the other members of the government approved the decision to keep the Uchiha clan under observation. He reveals Itachi was an Anbu tasked with spying on the Uchiha clan who was eventually ordered to exterminate them, and that the only people who knew the truth were Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado (the two advisors of the Konoha Council), Danz\u014d Shimura of the Anbu and the Third Hokage himself.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "141", "Episode Title": "Truth", "Japanese Airdate": "24 December 2009", "episode synopsis text": "Madara Uchiha continues to tell Sasuke about the truth behind Itachi's actions. When Itachi was four, he had witnessed the deaths of many during the Third Shinobi World War, and thus developed a pacifist nature. Sasuke and Itachi's father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the coup d'\u00e9tat that would have had the Uchiha clan overthrow the Senju government. \n\nIn order to aid in his coup, Fugaku had Itachi placed within the Anbu so he would serve as a spy for them. However, Itachi's loyalty was not towards his clan, but towards the village, and wanted to do what was best for Konohagakure. Thus, the Konoha Council and Danz\u014d Shimura had exploited that trait and had Itachi spy on the Uchiha clan for them. When the Third Hokage was unable to come to a peaceful negotiation with the Uchiha clan, the elders decided to eliminate them. Itachi was tasked with a hard decision \u2014 allow his clan to carry out its coup, causing the destabilisation of their village, deaths of countless innocent people as well as incite neighbouring nations to invade them, potentially starting the Fourth Shinobi World War, or to exterminate his clan in order to prevent a war and the numerous casualties that would come with it.\n\nMadara tells Sasuke that around that time, he had infiltrated Konoha in order to have his vengeance on the village itself as well as the Uchiha clan who had shunned him. Itachi was the only person who had known he was still alive and had managed to locate him, and had proceeded to offer him a counter proposal \u2014 he would help Madara extinguish the Uchiha clan in exchange for sparing the village, which Madara had readily agreed to. However, while Itachi had managed to murder his father, his mother, and his lover, he was unable to kill his little brother, and thus had spared Sasuke's life. Following the clan's massacre, Madara and Itachi had split their ways while Itachi, reporting the mission's success to the village, had left Konoha; however, he had asked the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe from harm and threatened to leak the village's intelligence to unallied nations otherwise.\n\nSasuke refuses to accept Madara's story, claiming that Itachi had murdered their clan to test the limits of his abilities, that he was nothing more than a criminal who joined the Akatsuki, and that Itachi had no reason to protect him, citing that Itachi would not have used his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan against him if he was not trying to kill him. Madara reveals to Sasuke that Itachi's goal, other than implanting the Amaterasu within Sasuke, was to seal away Orochimaru as well as Sasuke's Cursed Seal of Heaven, a feat that was only capable if he had reduced Sasuke's chakra levels to their bare minimum. Madara also divulges that following the Konoha Crush, Itachi's true motive for returning to the village was to make sure that Sasuke would be kept safe from the likes of Danz\u014d following the Third's death, and that he was also spying on the Akatsuki from within for Konoha's sake.\n\nAs Madara finishes his tale, Sasuke stands on a cliff, noticing at a hawk flying around. Tears streaming down his face, he recalls the memories of his brother he had before the clan's massacre and how much he had loved and respected Itachi. He then declares that he is renaming their team from Hebi to Taka, and that their new mission is to destroy Konohagakure, awakening his own Mangeky\u014d Sharingan in the process.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "142", "Episode Title": "Battle_of_Valley_of_Clouds_and_Lightning", "Japanese Airdate": "7 January 2010", "episode synopsis text": "As the Eight Man Squad stand on the ruins of the Uchiha Hideout, Kakashi orders them all to fan out and track Sasuke's lingering scent. However, the scent is too faint and, unable to locate Sasuke and their mission to find Itachi being a failure, Kakashi decides that they should all return back to Konoha.\n\nElsewhere, Tobi finds Sasuke staring up at a full moon, the latter claiming that every time he does so, he is reminded of that fateful night. Sasuke tells him that he is able to access repressed memories of that night, including awakening his Sharingan for the first time and chasing after Itachi, who looked back at him as tears fell down his face. Sasuke had believed that he had imagined it, but the memory of the tears convinces him that the story he heard was true. Meanwhile, Tobi manages to locate Kisame, who had decided to leave the Akatsuki following Itachi's death. Tobi, however, changes from his goofy voice and demeanour to a more serious one and removes his mask, and Kisame recognises him as Madara Uchiha, the former Mizukage himself. Surprised that Tobi is actually Madara and that Madara is pulling the strings, Kisame decides to rejoin the Akatsuki. \n\nIn their hideout, Tobi asks Sasuke what his intentions are, and Sasuke responds that he plans to kill the elders of Konoha to avenge Itachi and their clan but does not care what happens to the villagers. Tobi then proposes to Sasuke and his team that they work together to find the tailed beasts in order to achieve their goals. Madara explains that there are nine of them, whom the First Hokage used to control and use to settle conflicts. As a sign of the nations' alliance, the First Hokage had given a tailed beast to every nation. Madara asks Taka to join the Akatsuki since they are low on manpower, following the recent deaths of their many members, and tasks Taka with capturing the Eight-Tails while the Akatsuki capture Naruto, the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails.\n\nOutside, Madara has a conversation with Zetsu and expressed his gratitude that Itachi is dead, since without him around to stop them, they may finally invade and destroy Konoha. Zetsu inquires as to why Itachi would have passed down his Amaterasu to Sasuke if he did not know that Madara knew the truth, to which Madara responds that it was most likely to prevent Sasuke's induction into the ranks of the Akatsuki. Madara claims that with Itachi gone and Sasuke taking his place, his plans are finally coming to fruition.\n\nOn their sojourn to find the Eight-Tails, Sasuke uses his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan's genjutsu to interrogate Kiyoi Yotsuki, a shinobi from Kumogakure, who reveals that the Eight-Tails' jinch\u016briki is a man with a tattoo on his right shoulder and numerous blades in his possession, and that he is at the Valley of Clouds and Lightning. After arriving at the valley, they find themselves face-to-face with a rapper named Killer B, who is the jinch\u016briki of the Eight-Tails. Suigetsu attempts to attack him with his Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d, only for Killer B to use his strength to pry the blade away from him; J\u016bgo attempts to attack as well, but Killer B uses the Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d to defeat him. Seeing his defeated teammates, Sasuke decides to step up and handle the jinch\u016briki himself, claiming that he wishes to acquire the tailed beast in order to use the Akatsuki in his quest to destroy Konoha.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "143", "Episode Title": "The_Eight-Tails_vs._Sasuke", "Japanese Airdate": "14 January 2010", "episode synopsis text": "With his Sword of Kusanagi in hand, Sasuke goes up against Killer B, the jinch\u016briki of the Eight-Tails. Killer B, in possession of Suigetsu's Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d, attempts to strike at Sasuke, only for the latter to pin his sword into the ground to balance himself as he kicks Killer B in the neck. Sasuke manages to loosen Killer B's grip on the Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d and returns it to Suigetsu.\n\nWith the Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d being taken away from him, Killer B unleashes his seven swords and wields them using various parts of his body. Sasuke attempts to hit Killer B with his Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana, only for Killer B to infuse his own Lightning Release into his swords, blocking the attack. Sasuke continues to go on the offensive, using his Sharingan to keep track of the swords, but nearly misses Killer B attempting a heel kick; Sasuke avoids the kick but ends up being severely impaled by two of his swords.\n\nKarin tells Sasuke to bite her, her chakra healing Sasuke's near-fatal wounds, as Killer B attempts to take the opportunity to kill Sasuke; however, Suigetsu blocks the attack with his Kubikirib\u014dch\u014d. Killer B's Lightning Release swords begin to slice through Suigetsu's blade, but Sasuke recovers enough to use his Chidori to counter Killer B's chakra. As Karin sits out, exhausted from healing Sasuke, the others decide to attack Killer B in tandem, with Suigetsu advising that they not hold back. Killer B manages to use his Disturbance Taijutsu to land a hit on Suigetsu, grinding his fist into the other's chest, only for Suigetsu to trap Killer B's fist with his Hydrification Technique. With Killer B unable to move out of the way, Suigetsu tells Sasuke to hit them both, and Sasuke uses his Chidori on Killer B as he is wet, the water conducting the electricity and shocking both of them.\n\nAs Killer B lays there dazed, J\u016bgo attempts to hit him from above, only for Killer B to jump out of the way. The jinch\u016briki states that he has had enough with the battle and decides to go out for a drink. Using her Mind's Eye of the Kagura technique, Karin spots Killer B's location as Sasuke rushes towards him. Realising that his foes are troublesome, Killer B goes into his Version 1 form, growing chakra tails; Sasuke recalls when Naruto did the same during their battle. Using his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan, Sasuke is able to dodge Killer B's tailed form, only for the jinch\u016briki to go after the other Taka members. Entering into a partial transformation, J\u016bgo uses his jet boosters to save himself, Karin, and Suigetsu, though the latter falls into the surrounding body of water.\n\nThe result of Killer B slamming into the ground causes large clouds of smoke to appear before them. Killer B attempts to rush at Sasuke, who uses his Mangekyo enhanced genjutsu on him. However, Killer B snaps out of the genjutsu instantly and uses his Lightning Release: Lariat to punch Sasuke, rupturing his neck, chest, and his organs. Killer B muses how genjutsu does not work jinch\u016briki who have complete control of their tailed beast since the beast's chakra could snap the host out of any genjutsu. \n\nAs Sasuke lays there dying, J\u016bgo uses his Piston Fist: Style One to punch the jinch\u016briki and proceeds to use his Cellular Regeneration Ejection to heal Sasuke, claiming that Sasuke would not die from it since he is compatible with the cursed seal; however, the process causes J\u016bgo to regress in physical age, giving him the appearance of a young child. Meanwhile, Killer B enters into a full transformation, unleashing the Eight-Tailed Ox from within. As he attempts to attacks them, Suigetsu uses the surrounding water to create a form that resembles a demon-like fish, and blocks Killer B's attack. In this form, Suigetsu is able to face the Eight-Tails head on while Sasuke, Karin and J\u016bgo try to flee. In order to prevent their escape, Killer B fires his Tailed Beast Ball at them, although Suigetsu's form is able to absorb all the damage himself, saving his teammates. \n\nShocked at the fact that Suigetsu was willing to risk his life for him and recalling how Karin and J\u016bgo had healed him from fatal injuries at their own expense, Sasuke is reminded of Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura. Wanting to protect his teammates, Sasuke's left Sharingan transforms into the Mangeky\u014d and proceeds to use Amaterasu, setting the tailed beast on fire. Killer B attempts to use a tentacle to crush Karin but Sasuke uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to slice the tentacle off; however, another tentacles manages to swat Karin and she is engulfed in the black flames as well. Desperate to save Karin's life, Sasuke's left Mangeky\u014d manages to extinguish the flames, much to his surprise. Realising he can control the flames, Sasuke puts out the Amaterasu, revealing an unconscious Killer B.\n\nWith his eyes bleeding from using the Mangeky\u014d, Sasuke asks J\u016bgo to retrieve Karin as well as Killer B. Unbeknownst to them, they are being observed by J and K, two shinobi of Kumogakure. Noticing the Akatsuki robes as well as Sasuke's Uchiha clan crest, and remembering how Yugito Nii, another jinch\u016briki from their village, was killed by the Akatsuki, the two shinobi decide to report their findings to the Raikage, who happens to be Killer B's brother.\n\nJ\u016bgo and Sasuke begin their walk back to their hideout, carrying an unconscious Karin and Killer B, as well as Suigetsu, who has been rendered to a jelly-like state. J\u016bgo asks if Sasuke is okay physically, as he had lost his Cursed Seal of Heaven in his fight with Itachi and subsequently did not recover completely from said fight. Sasuke admits that he did not expect a fight of such magnitude, but states that at least they managed to succeed in their mission.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "144", "Episode Title": "Wanderer", "Japanese Airdate": "21 January 2010", "episode synopsis text": "On a cliff, a young lady named Hotaru sits on the edge overlooking the mountain when she is approached by a young man named Utakata.

She asks whether he remembers the first time he met and he had saved her life, using his Soap Bubble Ninjutsu to kill enemy shinobi who were after her. Utakata reveals that they were after him, as he is a wanted man, and that he was only saving himself; his only reason for coming with her to their fort was to throw off his trail. Hotaru does not care, and cries for her \"master\" to train her. Angered at being called master, Utakata lashes out, only for Naruto to interfere. Using his shadow clones, Naruto attempts to defeat Utakata, who uses his Drowning Bubble Technique to take out the shadow clones.

He remembers when he first met Hotaru, and how she begged him to be her master. Having been irritated at the word \"master\" (due to his own master abusing him), he refused; Hotaru, however, reminded him that he was getting free food and a room and that he should pay them back by teaching her. He told her that he would consider it if she is able to walk on water. When Hotaru failed, Utakata claimed that he cannot teach anyone ninjutsu if they cannot manage to walk on the surface of water.

Itachi had asked Naruto what he would do if Sasuke were to attack Konoha, since Naruto views Sasuke as his brother, and asks if Naruto would kill him. Naruto replied that he would save the village without murdering Sasuke in the process. Itachi calls him a childish fool, claiming that shinobi must make hard decisions, prompting Naruto to remember when Jiraiya had told him to give up on Sasuke since shinobi must make such decisions. Naruto promptly told Itachi that he would not give up on Sasuke as it was part of his ninja way; Itachi proceeded to smile and stored his crow inside Naruto, telling the former that he was sharing some of his power with him in the event Sasuke did decide to attack the village.

Sasuke had responded that he held the two members of the Konoha Council and Danz\u014d Shimura responsible and thus would kill them, as those three were the ones who ordered Itachi to murder his own clan, including his mother and father. Sasuke told Madara that Itachi was unable to kill him that night because Itachi viewed Sasuke's life as more precious than the village's; similarly, Sasuke finds that Itachi's life is more precious than the village's, and wishes to slaughter everyone who lives in Konoha, stating that they are all equally as guilty for living in the safe and peaceful environment that Itachi had sacrificed everything for. Having noticed Madara's unresponsive manner, Sasuke reminded the Uchiha that while the former may write him off as an emotional brat, he does not care for anyone who thinks of him in a different manner and that his love for Itachi and the subsequent inconsolable grief that came after his death would cause him to assassinate anybody who stood in his way.

With the other Paths unable to see through the dust cloud and the Animal Path unable to see inside Gamabunta's mouth, Naruto uses his remaining senjutsu to form his Spiralling Serial Spheres and rams it at the Animal Path, destroying it. Gamabunta then regurgitates the destroyed Path as well as Naruto, whose Sage Mode is deactivated as he has run out of natural energy. \n\nThe Deva Path begins to attack Naruto, believing it to be an easy fight now that Naruto is not in Sage Mode. Naruto tosses his scroll to Fukasaku, who summons a Naruto shadow clone that was gathering natural energy back at Mount My\u014dboku.

Fukasaku explains to Shima that since they could not fuse with him due to the Nine-Tails rejecting them, Naruto had come up with that creative, ingenious solution to circumvent Sage Mode's five minute duration.

Seeing the look on his sensei's face, Naruto asks how come everyone looks at him in that manner and runs away, vowing never to return to the Academy. \n\nThe following day, Iruka runs into Kakashi, who notices that his eyes are now lifeless. In the past, Kakashi was the squad leader on a mission Iruka was sent on, and the mission was endangered by Iruka's compassionate nature towards enemy shinobi. Deciding to use his compassion for good, Iruka asked the Third Hokage to have him appointed as an Academy instructor so that he could pass on the Will of Fire to the next generation. Kakashi remarks how Iruka's eyes held a spark that day, but that they are now dull. Iruka tells Kakashi that he cannot tolerate Naruto, albeit knowing that it is not Naruto's fault for housing a demon within him and that Naruto is just too troublesome to handle.

As the kids' parents come, a mother reprimands her child for playing with \"that kid\", something Iruka and Shikamaru both notice. As the kids and parents leave, Naruto grows sad at the fact that he has no parents to go home to and that the other parents do not like their kids playing with him.

Unable to tell Naruto the truth, Shikaku merely tells his son to ignore how the others treat Naruto and to treat Naruto in whatever way he wishes to treat him.\n\nThe next day, Hibachi tricks Naruto into heading to the back hills where enemy corpses are laid, promising to be his friend if he does so. Naruto, ecstatic at the prospect of finally having friends, rushes to the hills. In class, Iruka notices that Naruto is still absent and asks Hibachi if he had seen him, to which Hibachi lies and claims that he did not.

The woman, Hanare, was actually a spy for the J\u014dmae Village, and was taken in for interrogation with Ibiki. Fruitless with his results, Ibiki went to find Inoichi who was able to get into her mind and find out all that she found out about Konoha and J\u014dmae Village, but Hanare used her technique against him, to find out all that he knows about Konoha. Since Inoichi found a memory of a young Kakashi, he went to find him. When Kakashi and Hanare stop to look at the clouds after taking a walk, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who were eavesdropping on the conversation, fell out of a tree, causing Kakashi to fall on top of Hanare, making them accidentally kiss. Knowing about Hanare's assumed lack of any information on Konoha, the Third Hokage assigns the ninja team to go rescue Riichi from the J\u014dmae ninja, in exchange for Hanare. The exchange happened at the centre of the bridge, but when Riichi was on Konoha's side of the bridge, Kakashi blew the bridge up, unwilling to let Hanare go. Hanare ran away, with Kakashi in pursuit, until they reached a cliff, where Hanare said that she wanted to die by Kakashi's hands, and that she already removed all that she had learned about Konoha from her mind. He told her that he would never kill a ninja that had lost their honour, and told her to leave. As Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura found them, Kakashi claims that Hanare jumped off the cliff.

She tells Naruto that she has grown to love him and has given up on Sasuke, who is nothing but a mere criminal who has joined the Akatsuki.

Using his Mind Puppet Switch Cursed Seal Technique, F\u016b transfers his consciousness into a puppet he leaves lying in a tree, which he rigs to attack Ao in order to use it as a medium to perform his Mind Body Switch Technique on the Kiri-nin. With Ao's consciousness confined to the puppet, F\u016b attempts to extract the Byakugan with a kunai, but Ao's talisman earrings form a barrier around the eye. Ao tells F\u016b that only he and certain Kiri-nin can undo the barrier seal. Undeterred, F\u016b decides to decapitate \"himself\" on the blade of the sword, cancelling his Mind Body Switch technique at the last second, as his original body is given the same injuries as his host body.\n\nAs he jumps off a tree and prepares to slice Ao's head off, he is saved by the Fifth Mizukage. \"Ao\" tells her that he was under the enemy's Mind Body Switch technique and apologises for being careless. The Mizukage offers to undo the barrier seal, and \"Ao\" thanks her. At that moment, the Mizukage tightens the ropes on Ao's hands and tells Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d to hand her his Hiramekarei.

Although he manages to severely wound Kisame, Kisame's blade once again devours his chakra, instantly reverting Killer B into his Version 1 four-tailed form. Siphoning the chakra his blade stole, Kisame uses it to heal the injuries sustained from the Lariat. He muses that he is known as the tailless tailed beast and proceeds to utilise his Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave to create a giant water dome. \n\nKisame fuses himself with the Samehada, sprouting gills and furthering his shark-like appearance. As the Eight-Tails realises that the dome moves in conjunction with Kisame's movements, the beast suggests that Killer B move in the opposite direction as Sabu and Ponta.

Killer B enters into a partial transformation, morphing the lower half of his body into octopus tentacles to bind Kisame. B manages to get loose as Kisame drains his chakra and shoots out ink to cover his tracks, although Kisame is able to sense his chakra and attacks him until B's chakra is at its lowest. Bursting the dome of water, Kisame prepares to cut off B's legs to prevent him from running away. However, the Samehada blade grows a liking to Killer B's chakra and refuses to sever his legs, instead choosing to transfer back the chakra it stole.

However, Sai responds that it is because she loves him that she has agreed to eliminate him, and adds his personal conjecture that he believes that she is planning to kill him herself, much to Naruto's shock. Sai tells Naruto that the only reason Sakura \"confessed\" was to alleviate Naruto from the promise he made, but when Naruto was steadfast in his decision to save Sasuke regardless, she could not bring herself to tell him of their plan to terminate him. He also adds that the reason Sakura is doing all of this is because of what Sai said to Sakura back in Konoha, unintentionally guilt-tripping her into doing this.

Seeing this, Torune, who had removed his shirt, unleashes his rinkaich\u016b. However, Madara had tricked them into thinking he would manifest and Torune's attack hits F\u016b instead. As Torune heals F\u016b, Madara realises that F\u016b and Torune are from Konoha's Yamanaka clan and Aburame clan, and compliments Danz\u014d for his choice in subordinates.

Danz\u014d rushes forward in a burst of speed to attack Sasuke, but the attack is blocked by the latter's Susanoo. Trapped within the Susanoo's grip, Sasuke asks whether Danz\u014d had really ordered Itachi to slaughter his own clan. When Danz\u014d remarks that he never pegged Itachi as the type to divulge secrets before dying, Sasuke accepts it as acknowledgement and crushes Danz\u014d, seemingly killing him.\n\nHowever, Danz\u014d reappears right behind Sasuke, and attempts to stab him with a kunai, only for the Susanoo to shield him once more. As Danz\u014d jumps high into the air, Sasuke ascends into the Susanoo's head and incinerates Danz\u014d with his Amaterasu.

Karin wonders why Danz\u014d did not simply use his \"immortality\" technique to avoid the attack like he had been doing all along, noticing that using the tree significantly decreased his chakra levels. Meanwhile, Madara realises that Danz\u014d's ability to use Wood Release means that Danz\u014d had been transplanted with Hashirama Senju's cells by Orochimaru, and that the Senju cells allows him to wield multiple Sharingan eyes and to use Izanagi despite not being of Uchiha blood; additionally, possessing the First Hokage's Wood Release in conjunction with the Uchiha's Sharingan would grant Danz\u014d the ability to control a tailed beast, notably the Nine-Tailed Fox, and thus realises that obtaining Naruto is one of Danz\u014d's goals.\n\nDespite bleeding out of his eye, Sasuke strains himself to fire another arrow, yet Danz\u014d simply uses Izanagi once more to negate its effects.

Using its powerful inhalation, Baku attempts to draw in Sasuke and his Susanoo. Danz\u014d appears behind Sasuke and bombards him with his Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves, which are augmented by Baku's power, to force the Susanoo towards the tapir. Sasuke takes advantage of Baku's inhalation by unleashing his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, which Baku immediately ingests; in pain, it dispels itself out of the battle. As Danz\u014d attempts to strike Sasuke from behind, his attack having caused a weak spot in Susanoo's rear armour, Sasuke turns around and has the Susanoo punch Danz\u014d, who uses Izanagi once more to survive unharmed.\n\nKarin observes that another Sharingan eye has shut itself on Danz\u014d's right arm. She counts the ten eyes and notices that there are only five left and realises that once the remaining five are sealed shut, Danz\u014d would not be able to evade fatal injuries anymore. She attempts to relay her findings to Sasuke, but he merely tells her that he had already caught on earlier and thus had been forcing Danz\u014d the entire time to continue relying on Izanagi until he used up all ten eyes. Infuriated, Danz\u014d uses Wind Waves to attack the oncoming Susanoo; while he does not destroy it, he is able to block it. However, Danz\u014d is punched by the Susanoo once more and uses his seventh eye to utilise Izanagi again. Manifesting himself behind Sasuke, whose Susanoo has faded away, Danz\u014d throws kunai towards him, although Sasuke uses his bracelets to produce shuriken, which he throws back. Unable to evade it in mid-air, Danz\u014d employs Izanagi to elude it, leaving him with only two Sharingan eyes on his right arm.

Sasuke forms his Chidori and begins to approach them, while Naruto creates two shadow clones in response. Kakashi, however, bars Naruto and his clones from engaging in combat, telling him to take Sakura and flee instead since he does not want them to see what he is about to do. Naruto asks if his words imply that he is going to kill Sasuke, but Kakashi merely produces his Lightning Cutter and takes a stance towards Sasuke. Gritting his teeth, Naruto has a shadow clone restrain Kakashi while using the other to form his Rasengan, and rushes towards Sasuke, who is also running towards him.\n\nAs they head towards each other, Naruto recalls how he was treated when he was younger and muses how their roles could have been reversed, imagining himself using Chidori and Sasuke stopping him with Rasengan. The two remember their last battle at the Valley of the End as their attacks once more clash against one another; Sasuke and Naruto look at each other. In his mind, Naruto tells Sasuke that he could have been just like him, as he once hated all the villagers for treating him badly and that he wanted revenge against them too. He credits his change in attitude to Sasuke and Iruka, with whom he formed a bond, the latter even saving his life from Mizuki when Mizuki revealed to him that he was the vessel of the Nine-Tails. Naruto reflects on how he was happy to realise that Sasuke was an orphan like him and thought they could talk and bond over it; however, he and Sasuke had a chasm in skill between them and so Naruto decided to be his rival instead.

He reflects upon the good memories he had, such as when they tried to peek at Kakashi's face, as well as the not so good memory of their fight at the Valley of the End. Sasuke tells Naruto that he would not stop in his quest for vengeance and that Naruto would simply have to kill him or get killed, but Naruto states that he would not let either option happen.\n\nIn the real world, the Rasengan and Chidori clash against one another and explodes, causing Naruto and Sasuke to fall backwards towards the rock walls. Naruto's shadow clone flings Kakashi in Naruto's direction to catch him while one of White Zetsu's parasite clones catches Sasuke. Knowing that Sasuke would not retreat, White Zetsu visits Madara at his base, where the latter has Danz\u014d's corpse as well as various Sharingan eyes stored. White Zetsu notifies Madara that Sasuke is in a bit of a bind, and Madara and Zetsu head to the Samurai Bridge.\n\nWhite Zetsu and his clones prepare to engage in combat against Naruto, but Madara tells him to stand down, alerting him that he would lose and thus he would set up a fight between Naruto and Sasuke in the future in order to obtain the Nine-Tails. Before they leave, Naruto tells Sasuke that if he ever does decide to attack Konoha, he would be waiting there for him, and would shoulder the burden of Sasuke's hatred. In anger, Sasuke lashes out and demands to know why Naruto is fixated on him, to which Naruto replies that it is because they are friends. Naruto asks whether Sasuke remembers what he had said during their fight at the Valley; how two high-level shinobi can reach others' minds when they exchange fists. Naruto tells Sasuke that he has finally understood what Sasuke is going through, and if it means exchanging blows, then he would continue to do so to further understand him. He asks Sasuke whether he read his mind too, but Sasuke shrugs him off and merely states that he does not wish to and that he would kill him. Smiling, Naruto tells him that if they fought, both of them would die; however, he is optimistic that at least in the afterlife they would be relieved of their respective burdens.\n\nKakashi tries to use Kamui to take out Madara, who quickly informs Kakashi that such a technique would not work on him.

She observes Naruto's forehead protector, identifying him as a Konoha-nin, and asks whether he has heard of the legendary sannin Jiraiya and whether Jiraiya had any pupils. Naruto notifies her of Jiraiya's fate as well as the fact that he is Jiraiya's student, only to be stunned by Tokiwa's statement that he must duel and marry Shizuka. She explains that the village is matrilineal and that the law dictates that the kunoichi must marry the man who defeats them in order to have a suitable husband.\n\nNaruto returns to Guy, Aoba, and Yamato, who tell him not to get involved in the village's affairs as they only came to restock on their supplies. Later that night, Naruto spots Tokiwa waiting outside the house they are dwelling in and she tells him how the villager's former leader fought Jiraiya for his hand in marriage. However, Jiraiya stopped the fight and promised that their two students would continue the fight in the future. Tokiwa also explains that once, Shizuka had a lover named Sagiri, although Sagiri was a mere tradesman who the village did not believe was worthy to be the husband of the village's leader. When Sagiri was mysteriously killed in an accident believed to be perpetrated by the village elders, Shizuka locked away her heart and decided never to love again.\n\nThe next morning, the four Konoha shinobi set out towards the Land of Lightning, unaware that the Naruto on board is a mere shadow clone.

Enraged, Naruto cuts the chakra threads with his kunai and strikes him in the torso with his Rasengan, sending him flying away. Shizuka questions Naruto for saving her instead of defeating her, and he reiterates that he does not wish to marry her, adding that he believes one should be in love before getting married. He reveals to her that he is in love with a girl named Sakura, who in turn is in love with someone named Sasuke. Despite the love being one-sided, he tells her that he enjoys the beautiful smile on her face whenever she was near Sasuke and that he would never try to interfere in her love for him since all he wishes is for her to be happy. Shizuka is reminded of her lover, Sagiri, who had said the same thing. Just then, Yamato arrives, intent on punishing Naruto for tricking him with a shadow clone once again.\n\nAs they set off towards the Land of Lightning once more, Shizuka remembers her predecessor mentioning how Jiraiya had revealed to her about his one-sided love for Tsunade, and how Tsunade had suffered so much heartbreak that she had closed her heart off.

Right as the kunai goes through Tobi's head, he materialises in order to grab a hold of Minato; however, Minato forms his Rasengan and teleports to the kunai's location behind Tobi, and manages to land a successful hit, marking him as well.

Awakening back in the Tailed Beast Temple, Naruto mentally communicates what transpired to Killer B via a fist bump, which irritates Yamato, since he cannot understand. He shows his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode to the two, only to immediately sense Kisame's presence within Samehada, shocking the latter since his chakra signature and that of the swords are indistinguishable. Kisame realises that Naruto has the ability to sense his hatred and reveals to a shocked Killer B that the \"Kisame\" he and his brother decapitated was just a Parasite Clone. He attempts to flee with the intelligence he has gathered thus far. Naruto immediately runs and kicks Kisame, his speed stunning Yamato and Killer B, with the latter likening it to the Yellow Flash's. However, Naruto exerts too much power in the kick and sprains his ankle, giving Kisame an opportunity to escape. As Yamato tends to Naruto, Killer B rushes out to intercept Kisame.\n\nMeanwhile, Guy wishes to partake in the same training as Naruto and sits in front of the Falls of Truth in order to encounter his inner self. While he initially meets his other side, one who criticised his desire to stay youthful, he is forced to return to reality when Kisame comes bursting through the waterfall. Believing it to be his true inner self, Guy uses his Leaf Rock-Destroying Rise to kick Kisame into a rock wall, only to be told that it is an Akatsuki member. Samehada leaves Kisame to be with Killer B, but Kisame grabs on to Samehada's handle and siphons nearly all of Killer B's chakra. Aoba tries to paralyse him with his Secret Technique Stone Needles, although Kisame merely drains his chakra as well. Declaring that his chakra reserves have been completely filled, Kisame uses his Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique to encase himself inside of a shark made of water and flies through the air, heading to the ocean. Guy activates his Sixth Gate and is propelled into the air by Killer B, who used what little chakra he had left to transform one of his hands into the Eight-Tails'.\n\nAs he begins to descend prematurely, Guy uses the Summoning Technique to call forth Ningame in mid-air, in order to use the turtle as a stepping stone. Guy manages to catch up to Kisame just as the latter places a scroll containing intel inside of a shark he summoned. Kisame uses his Water Release: A Thousand Feeding Sharks to hide the real shark amongst the other 999, although Guy merely uses his Morning Peacock to dispel most of them. Realising that Kisame and the other sharks have gone underwater, Guy submerges as well, opening his Seventh Gate. Impressed at Guy's taijutsu, Kisame is confident that his next attack would finish his opponent off and employs his Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique, which Guy counters with his Daytime Tiger.

He brings the subdued Kisame back to land, where Yamato restrains him so that Aoba can gather intel on the Akatsuki. Using his Psycho Mind Transmission technique, Aoba sifts through Kisame's memories.\n\nBack when Kisame was a Kirigakure shinobi, he was instructed by his superior, Fuguki Suikazan, who was one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, to serve as a bodyguard for Kiri's Cypher Division. Fuguki explicitly instructed him to do whatever was necessary to prevent their intelligence and secret codes from being leaked to any enemies. Whilst serving as their guard, Miru, a kunoichi from the Cypher Division, asked him to come and eat with the others, while the rest rebuffed him as a cold, callous individual. Shortly after, Kisame sensed the presence of enemies, who were revealed to be the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force, led by Ibiki Morino. As Ibiki's team began capturing wounded Kiri-nin alive, Kisame dropped explosive tags near them or impaled them with his sword to kill them, in order to prevent Konoha from gathering intelligence. After being cornered on a cliff, Kisame killed the remaining three, including Miru. With her dying breath, Miru asked why Kisame would do such a thing, and he explained that he had to do what was necessary to prevent an intelligence leak and that killing his comrades was his specialty. Kisame then jumped off the cliff to elude his own capture.\n\nAfter reporting back to the village, Kisame discovered that Fuguki himself was leaking intelligence to their enemies and killed his own master as a result, as it was his duty to kill fellow Kiri-nin in order to prevent leaks. After killing Fuguki, he took the swordsman's Samehada blade for his own. The murder was witnessed by Yagura, the Mizukage, who commended him for his efforts. Kisame, however, was wary as he believed that Yagura would simply kill him whenever his usefulness ended and mused that he had no sense of identity and wondered what he could do to achieve peace, instead of being stuck in a cycle of killing and deceit. To his surprise, a man emerged from behind Yagura and offered him the chance to join him as a comrade in order to obtain true peace. Kisame was shocked to see that the man possessed a Sharingan, which he had been using to control Yagura. Knowing that the shinobi in front of him must be quite formidable to not only control a kage but also a jinch\u016briki, as Yagura held the Three-Tails within him, Kisame demanded to know who the man was. The man declared himself to be none other than Madara Uchiha, and emerged from the shadows in order to show his face and prove it. \n\nWanting to protect his leader's identity, Kisame bites through his tongue, disrupting Aoba's technique, and proceeds to break out of his wooden restraints. Knowing he is too weak to fight the shinobi before him, Kisame traps himself inside his Water Prison Technique and recalls when he first met Itachi when they were partnered together, and how Itachi told him that a man does not know his true nature until he reaches the end of his life. Realising that he would rather die in order to protect the Akatsuki, Kisame summons three sharks and commits suicide by allowing the sharks to devour him. Naruto and Yamato are shocked, while Killer B confirms via Samehada that it is not a trick and that Kisame has actually died. Remembering Nagato and Konan, Naruto states that even in the Akatsuki, shinobi would sacrifice their lives in order to protect their comrades. Guy remarks that it is an honourable thing for a shinobi to do so, and declares he would never forget Kisame so long as he lives.\n\nGuy picks up the scroll containing the intel Kisame had gathered and opens it, only for it to be rigged.

Kabuto asks Tobi where he is going, wanting Tobi to trust him since they are allies. Tobi merely remarks that Kabuto has only joined them to fulfil his own ambitions but notifies him that he is heading to Amegakure as Kabuto smirks.\n\nIn Amegakure, Konan stands outside Pain's Tower and smiles at the rain falling down on her village, reminding her of a time when the three Ame Orphans return to their hideout to see Jiraiya dressed as a frog, and how they laughed. Her happiness quickly dissipates by the arrival of Tobi, who wishes to know where she buried Nagato, as he requires the Rinnegan. Using her Dance of the Shikigami technique, Konan splits herself into several flying origami birds and heads out to lake. Tobi joins her at the lake, and asks why she and Nagato had betrayed the Akatsuki; more specifically, he inquires as to why Nagato used the Outer Path \u2014 Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive the fallen Konoha civilians when the technique was supposed to be reserved for his use, adding that both she and Nagato had approved of his Eye of the Moon Plan.\n\nKonan recalls when Naruto had convinced Pain that he would find the path to true peace no matter what, and how she had told Naruto that he now embodied both Nagato and Yahiko's dreams. Tobi realises that Naruto had swayed Nagato, but remarks that he did not think Konan would be easily affected by the musings of a na\u00efve child. Konan assumes a defensive stance, and Tobi reminds her that the Akatsuki does not tolerate traitors and that he finds it amusing that she still wears the Akatsuki robes despite betraying them. Konan responds that the Akatsuki was formed by Yahiko, with the red clouds representing the bloody rain that fell upon Amegakure, and that Tobi simply retooled the organisation for his own machinations; additionally, the Rinnegan was awoken by Nagato who wished to use it for the welfare of the village, and that she would not allow it to fall into his hands. To her shock, Tobi reveals that he was the one who goaded Yahiko into founding the Akatsuki and that it was he who bestowed the Rinnegan to Nagato.\n\nThinking back to when Yahiko had considered himself to the pillar that would support Nagato, whom he believed to be the Saviour of this World and the bridge to true peace, and how Nagato had instead believed Yahiko to be the bridge, Konan remarks that this time, she would be the pillar that held up the two bridges that were her best friends. She sends various sheets of paper serving as projectiles towards Tobi, who merely becomes intangible and allows the attack to pass right through him. As Konan rushes towards him, he grabs onto Konan and uses Kamui in an attempt to transport her elsewhere; however, the sheets of paper have explosive tags on them, which detonate. Using Kamui, Tobi manages to pull himself and Konan from the centre of the blast, although his mask partially breaks and he loses his right arm as a result. Konan, who has lost the lower half of her body, suspends herself in mid-air and uses her Paper Person of God Technique to split the very lake underneath Tobi into two, creating an abyss.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "253", "Episode Title": "The_Bridge_to_Peace", "Japanese Airdate": "8 March 2012", "episode synopsis text": "Konan traps Tobi in the chasm created by her Paper Person of God Technique, remarking that she studied his abilities the entire time they were comrades and that his Kamui ability only works for five minutes, hence why the explosive tags on her sheets of paper are set to detonate for ten straight minutes. However, Tobi is revealed to have a Sharingan eye in his left eye socket and uses Izanagi to materialise behind Konan, who believes she has killed him. As he stabs her through the back with a metal rod, she asks who he is and how he could have survived. As a favour to her since she helped with the Eye of the Moon Plan during her tenure with the Akatsuki, he reveals the true nature behind Izanagi, likening it to the Sage of Six Paths' Creation of All Things Technique and reaffirms that he is the one and only Madara Uchiha, the self-proclaimed second Sage of Six Paths.\n\nKonan pulls herself off the rod and hobbles away, before noticing that the rain has stopped. Tobi wonders how the perpetual rainfall of Amegakure could end so abruptly, while Konan, seeing a rainbow and remembering how Yahiko told her how he hated the rain as it made it seem like the village is crying, declares to Tobi that Nagato and Yahiko are giving her strength and that Naruto is the true bridge to peace. She forms and fires a Paper Chakram towards Tobi, who is fighting with only one eye and an arm left. Nonetheless, Tobi is able to surpass her defences and chokes her, placing her within a genjutsu to find out Nagato's whereabouts as she passes away from her wounds.\n\nTobi makes his way to Nagato and Yahiko's Shrine, where he remarks that Nagato performed admirably well with the Rinnegan, declaring him to be the third Sage of Six Paths. As he notices Nagato's white hair, Tobi muses how much he must have strained himself to lose his red hair, the trademark of the Uzumaki clan from whom he is descended. Tobi then uses Kamui to transport himself and Nagato to Kamui's Dimension. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper on Konan's body, which is floating on the water, is soaked red with her blood and begins to drift away.\n\nIn the past, Jiraiya had enforced a Water on a Frog's Face Training, which utilised a \"hop-in\" card system which the Ame Orphans would use whenever they left their hideout. Whenever one member was out of the hideout they were to turn the card onto the side with the frog so that the others would be aware that they were not there, and while they were in the hideout, the card should be on the red side. If one of them was gone but that person's card was still red, it would signify that he or she had been captured and something was wrong and if it should happen that a plank is turned on to the white side yet the person is in the hideout it could mean that an enemy has transformed into said person and has infiltrated the hideout. Jiraiya explained that this was done as a precaution because Amegakure was still war torn and politically unstable. Konan's memories with Nagato and Yahiko are shown, including the formation of the Akatsuki and her first kiss with Yahiko, and how the three orphans were forced to flee their hideout, albeit promising to one day return along with Jiraiya. The blood-red sheet of paper floats all the way to the hideout, where it places itself on Konan's card, signifying that the four have been reunited at last in the afterlife.\n\nDiscarding his torn Akatsuki robe and damaged mask, Tobi dresses himself in a new robe, with the Uchiha clan crest on the back, along with a mask depicting the three tomoe design of the Sharingan, although with two eye holes this time.

Kabuto smirks as he responds that Orochimaru had done his research, and Tobi agrees to allow Kabuto to venture forth on his quest, promising him Zetsu if he can capture the two jinch\u016briki.

Popping his head out from atop the pyramid, the Second greets his opponents serenely before ducking back in to avoid a volley of shuriken launched at him. Commenting that this was a good spot to hide, the Mizukage tells the Kazekage and Tsuchikage that he would no longer divulge the mechanisms behind his techniques, because if they were unable to defeat him, they had no hope of taking on the opposition's leader.

However, since Kamui shares the same dimension, the lightning-enhanced kunai that Kakashi warped away, passed through the \"intangible\" part of Tobi's body and ended up in the other dimension and scratched the part of his body that was sent there in order to make him appear intangible. When questioned by B how it was possible that their two techniques were linked to the same dimension, a hesitant Guy began to question Kakashi, but the latter cuts across him to ask Tobi directly where he got the Sharingan from.

There, he notices the clone from earlier and realises that Kakashi did not just teleport the Rasengan but the clone itself. With little time to react, Tobi is hit by Naruto's Rasengan; his mask shattered into pieces. Watching on, Kakashi and Guy are shocked to see that the masked man is their former comrade, Obito Uchiha.

Madara tells the jinch\u016briki that the Kage were probably not doing well much to the latter's enragement. Elsewhere, Tsunade, who had been split into two, managed to summon Katsuyu. Katsuyu was distressed at Tsunade's condition and immediately wanted to piece her back together. However Tsunade told the giant slug to bring the other Kage to her as there might still be time to save them. Back on the battlefield, Obito returned Madara's gunbai to him in time for the famed Uchiha to block a volley of black receivers which Naruto had sent flying at the two of them. After hearing the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara asked Obito why he started the plan half-way through without the Eight and the Nine-Tails being captured and deemed his actions as hasty.

There, they meet with a group of people, who want to attack Iwagakure but the Akatsuki insists solving the issue through peace talks instead with the villagers refusing. This effort is in vain as the Konoha Anbu disguised as Iwa-shinobi refuse to negotiate and assault the three.

With Madara having overheard the brothers' conversation, Hashirama agreed and he became the First Hokage. Later, Madara brought Hashirama to the Naka Shrine, as the first outsider to see the Uchiha stone tablet.

Not understanding Madara's true agenda, Hashirama attempts to persuade him to not leave the village but is unsuccessful. Since then the village has prospered, and the other Great Nations as well as some of the smaller nations have copied the village system.

When Itachi was four, he had witnessed the deaths of many during the Third Shinobi World War, and thus developed a pacifist nature. Sasuke and Itachi's father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the coup d'\u00e9tat that would have had the Uchiha clan overthrow the Senju government. \n\nIn order to aid in his coup, Fugaku had Itachi placed within the Anbu so he would serve as a spy for them. However, Itachi's loyalty was not towards his clan, but towards the village, and wanted to do what was best for Konohagakure. Thus, the Konoha Council and Danz\u014d Shimura had exploited that trait and had Itachi spy on the Uchiha clan for them. When the Third Hokage was unable to come to a peaceful negotiation with the Uchiha clan, the elders decided to eliminate them. Itachi was tasked with a hard decision \u2014 allow his clan to carry out its coup, causing the destabilisation of their village, deaths of countless innocent people as well as incite neighbouring nations to invade them, potentially starting the Fourth Shinobi World War, or to exterminate his clan in order to prevent a war and the numerous casualties that would come with it.\n\nMadara tells Sasuke that around that time, he had infiltrated Konoha in order to have his vengeance on the village itself as well as the Uchiha clan who had shunned him. Itachi was the only person who had known he was still alive and had managed to locate him, and had proceeded to offer him a counter proposal \u2014 he would help Madara extinguish the Uchiha clan in exchange for sparing the village, which Madara had readily agreed to. However, while Itachi had managed to murder his father, his mother, and his lover, he was unable to kill his little brother, and thus had spared Sasuke's life. Following the clan's massacre, Madara and Itachi had split their ways while Itachi, reporting the mission's success to the village, had left Konoha; however, he had asked the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe from harm and threatened to leak the village's intelligence to unallied nations otherwise.\n\nSasuke refuses to accept Madara's story, claiming that Itachi had murdered their clan to test the limits of his abilities, that he was nothing more than a criminal who joined the Akatsuki, and that Itachi had no reason to protect him, citing that Itachi would not have used his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan against him if he was not trying to kill him. Madara reveals to Sasuke that Itachi's goal, other than implanting the Amaterasu within Sasuke, was to seal away Orochimaru as well as Sasuke's Cursed Seal of Heaven, a feat that was only capable if he had reduced Sasuke's chakra levels to their bare minimum. Madara also divulges that following the Konoha Crush, Itachi's true motive for returning to the village was to make sure that Sasuke would be kept safe from the likes of Danz\u014d following the Third's death, and that he was also spying on the Akatsuki from within for Konoha's sake.\n\nAs Madara finishes his tale, Sasuke stands on a cliff, noticing at a hawk flying around. Tears streaming down his face, he recalls the memories of his brother he had before the clan's massacre and how much he had loved and respected Itachi.

Not wishing to damage the world with more fighting, Kaguya teleports everyone, including herself, to a lava-filled dimension. While she hovers above, Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, Sakura and an unconscious Obito begin falling towards the lava. Sasuke saves himself by summoning Garuda to fly on it, then has Garuda catch Naruto.

Iwabee is frustrated he can't graduate only with shinobi related subjects. After a solid strike on him, Iwabee begins using Earth Release, creating an earth hammer. Inojin takes the hammer out of his reach with his drawings, and points out Iwabee broke his own rule on not using his weapon. Iwabee realises his mistake.

Metal Lee practices with ease at first, but when Inojin and Shikadai notice him, he becomes self-conscious, his performance suffering. Boruto throws a f\u016bma shuriken at the target. Lee thinks he can deflect it, but with eyes on him, he falters, instead getting his foot stuck on the shuriken and getting dragged by it. Shikadai asks Boruto where he got a f\u016bma shuriken, as they're not supposed to be using that yet. Boruto says he got it in a locker, which turn out to be Iwabee's. Shino calls everyone involved to his office, where he commands the ones involved to do voluntary work. They're assigned to help repair Naruto's face at the Hokage Rock, which Boruto damaged. After a break, they notice only Lee's part is missing, and getting anxious, he messes up his carving, causing more damage to Naruto's face. At the end of the day, Shikadai points out to Lee it's obvious he makes mistakes when nervous, and that sometimes it makes things worse for others. At home, Shikadai is scolded by his mother for getting into trouble. Shikamaru isn't as concerned, and considers getting in trouble part of becoming a shinobi. Temari scolds him as well.

While they practise summoning sealed weapons instead, the class soon becomes divided as the girls argue with the boys over maturity. While Konohamaru and Shino ponder what to do about the constant outbreaks of infighting, the class almost breaks out into another boys vs. girls battle at lunch. Shino intervenes just in time and instead gives the two sides the task of playing capture the flag within the Academy while he assesses each ones strengths and weaknesses. Things come to a head as both teams make their way to the rooftop: Boruto, who has stolen a scroll from the Academy once again attempts the Summoning Technique intending to summon a small toad to scare the girls. Instead, an unknown creature appears and strikes at Ch\u014dch\u014d throwing her off the building. Boruto, Inojin, and Shikadai are able to catch her, but the beast sets its sights on them while they helplessly dangle from the roof. Konohamaru arrives in time to defeat the beast with his Rasengan and Sumire silently steals the flag winning the match for the girls.

Sumire asks the students not to talk over Shino. Mitsuki sits by Boruto, striking up a conversation. During class, Boruto solves a problem on the board with ease, surprising Iwabee. Shino tells Boruto to solve the problem as instructed, but Boruto prefers doing it his way, and mockingly asks for something more advanced. Shino gives him a much tougher problem to solve, and Boruto accuses him of being a sore loser. Mitsuki solves the problem, impressing the others. He and Shino briefly discuss if students should help each other or learn to solve problems by themselves. During sparring, Iwabee and Boruto are paired off, and Iwabee manages to best him.

The students talk about Shino, unimpressed by him, which he overhears, getting him in a sullen mood. After first period, Shino asks for time off. A ruckus starts happening at the Academy,  as one of the repairman begins rampaging, destroying what's left of the Academy under the influence of the dark spectre. Mitsuki comments on Boruto's ability to see it, piquing Shikadai's interest, who speculates that Mitsuki is the reason people are acting out. Sarada distracts the repairman, allowing Shikadai to pin him down for Iwabee to strike. However, he doesn't go down, so Boruto tackles him, and the two fall over a balcony.

As they escape again, Shikadai notices the insects avoid water when he runs through a stream. Mitsuki regroups with them, claiming to have gotten lost. He asks Boruto about other people who went berserk after being possessed by the shadow only he can see. Shikadai grows suspicious of Mitsuki. Mitsuki suggests they kill Shino, as he wants to do the same to them.

Iwabee already asked Sarada to be on his team, Boruto considers asking Lee, and Mitsuki wishes Sumire could be on theirs. Boruto shushes him, as others don't know about Sumire's involvement in the incidents. Shino asks Iruka what will happen with Sumire, and insists he will watch over her if she returns. Boruto is surprised to see Naruto home early. They discuss Sumire. Shino visits Sumire, and offers to set up a place outside the village where she can figure herself out. Inojin tells Shikadai and Denki his father got files on other villages' academies, and figures Sumire is being transferred. Shino has the students catch a flag again.

Denki keeps trying to climb the wall later, and is approached by Metal, who offers to help him train. Metal takes him rock climbing. Denki loses his footing, but Rock Lee catches him when he falls. Iwabee struggles with arithmetic, despite having help from Boruto. Inojin and Shikadai conclude Denki would be a better teacher, but find it unlikely Iwabee would consider learning from him after his earlier comment. Denki spends the day failing at climbing with Metal and Rock Lee. Iwabee receives a low test score, and notices Denki still trying to climb the wall. Iwabee offers him advice on how to climb the wall, and Denki improves. Later, Denki asks why Iwabee helped him, despite his earlier comment. Iwabee lost all his friends when they graduated without him, and he doesn't wish that on others. Denki offers to tutor him, but Iwabee claims to be studying as well. Denki sees his low test score, and Iwabee confesses he doesn't want Denki to tutor him if it will interfere with Denki's own training. Denki reveals that meeting Boruto has changed his opinion on ninjutsu, now wanting be a shinobi just like them, and with Iwabee as well. The two decide to help each other out. When Iwabee struggles with studying, Denki decides to have him study while infusing chakra to stick to the ceiling, as his concentration improves when doing that. On the day of the test, Denki and Iwabee come by a building on fire. Iwabee goes in when he hears a woman despairing about her children in the building. Denki figures a building like that should have a sprinkler system, and finds it unusual it's not activating. Iwabee has to block an exit so the fire won't reach him and the children, and starts working on a wire box. At the Academy, Boruto worries about the two not showing up. Worried about Iwabee, Denki climbs the side of the building and enters through a window. He finds Iwabee's Earth Release wall, just as Iwabee finishes fixing the sprinkler system. The two take the children and climb down the side of the building. Boruto asks Shino to wait for Denki and Iwabee. The two arrive late. At Shino's office they explain why they were late. Shino decides they won't take the test, as tests are used to make sure they have the skills and knowledge for when something real happens, which they just did, prioritising human lives over a test.

Sakura notices a teddy bear that was supposed to have been picked up for one of her patients is still there. As she has no time to deliver it, Sarada offers to take it. At the train, Sarada gets distracted reading a note from her mother, and forgets the teddy bear on the train when she gets off.

The beasts were created centuries ago when the Sage of the Six Paths split up the immense power of the Ten-Tails. If Tobi recombines the tailed beasts into the original Ten-Tails and seals the Ten-Tails within his body, he will be able to place an illusion over the entire world and end all wars.

After the revolution is done, Shizuma plans to install Kagura as Mizukage, so Yagura's blood would rule over Kirigakure again, as a place that accepts him.

He decides to impose a gag order on the situation, and have them executed should they attack villagers. Boruto and Sarada reach Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Mei, and Boruto tells him Kagura went along with the plan so he'd be spared. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d states that as a shinobi, Kagura knows the consequences of breaking the rules. Boruto suggests they downplay the situation to an incident between kids who don't know better. When Mei expresses disagreement, he implies he'll play up the injury he sustained from Shizuma to stir a diplomatic incident.

Shikadai and Inojin find this sketchy, and decide not to ignore it. Iwabee finds and presses on Tsurushi for information. Meanwhile, Mitsuki tells  Suigetsu he knows he's been followed. Suigetsu passes on instructions for Mitsuki not to get further involved so Kirigakure doesn't learn of the connection between them. Suigetsu dislikes having to stay hidden after being away from home for so long, and decries the new group calling themselves swordsmen despite having no war experience. Mitsuki decides to do as he pleases. Shikadai and Inojin watch the exchange, but are discovered by Suigetsu.

Boruto reminds Kagura what he said about being the only one who decides how he lives, and Kagura responds that he's there because Shizuma acknowledged him. Boruto is unconvinced due to Kagura's expression. Boruto feints with three clones and distracts Kagura using his jacket, landing a hit. Boruto continues to dodge and block Kagura's attacks.

They also learn that Samehada is also absorbing their chakra from their wounds through the red mist. Boruto attacks with clones, and Mitsuki manages to get close enough to cut Shizuma's throat, but it's only a water clone. The deception lets the real Shizuma pin Mitsuki down with water spikes, but Mitsuki manages to avoid a fatal hit with Wind Release.

At the end of the day, Sai explains to him the jutsu failed because of the copies, but refuses to elaborate further, and suggests Inojin enter an art competition. Inojin deduces Sai knows why his jutsu is failing, but Sai is certain him just telling Inojin the reason won't fix it.

Sai is concerned Inojin won't be able to use Super Beast Imitating Drawing anymore, and suggests him look at how Inojin and Himawari's drawings differ.

She asks Mitsuki about what missions he likes to do. He tells her he's happy doing whatever Boruto is doing, prompting her to ask if he does something of his own will. He explains he chose that of his own will, and thinks back to his past. He remembers waking up under Orochimaru's care, and dropping a cup of medicine when taking it. Orochimaru instructs Suigetsu to escort him when he's fully awake. Mitsuki has no memory of who he was. Orochimaru comments to a hooded individual this is the sixth time something had happened. Mitsuki asks Suigetsu why he was in bed. Suigetsu answers he was injured in a mission with Orochimaru, figuring he doesn't remember the bad parts. Suigetsu suddenly attacks Mitsuki, who immobilises him. Mitsuki almost stabs Suigetsu with the kunai taken from him, but blocks it with his arm when Suigetsu commends him. Suigetsu comments his body remembers he is a shinobi, and breaks free of Mitsuki's hold by liquefying his arm. He explains Mitsuki was captured and had his memories erased, and that Orochimaru would have been disappointed had his abilities also been erased. Suigetsu takes Mitsuki to Orochimaru, who introduces himself as Mitsuki's parent. He explains a certain shinobi they call Log has stolen his memories, and they have to retrieve them. Mitsuki asks why they were after him in the first place, and Orochimaru explains he wants the intel Log has acquired, which is why he has to be taken alive. He dismisses Mitsuki's concern about his memories also being altered, and his question of which parent Orochimaru is. Mitsuki just wants to know who he is. They go after Log. Orochimaru has Mitsuki disrupt Log's barrier, which Log detects. They meet Log, who intended to go after them himself. He tries paralysing them, but it only works on Mitsuki. Log and Orochimaru battle, their speed impressing Mitsuki. Orochimaru attempts to use snakes to poison him, but his armour blocks their fangs. Log uses a jutsu to have his armour cover Orochimaru and hold him in place. Orochimaru tells Mitsuki he can use senjutsu. Log moves in to strike Mitsuki, but is paralysed himself with the venom of a small snake Orochimaru managed to slip through the gaps of his armour. Orochimaru tasks Mitsuki with watching over Log while he goes in search of something. Log asks Mitsuki to take off his mask, and tells him Orochimaru is deceiving him. Mitsuki removes Log's mask, revealing him to be an older version of Mitsuki. Log explains they're both synthetic humans created by Orochimaru. He goes on to say the thing Orochimaru is after is the original source from which both of them were cultured, that he had stolen, but couldn't destroy, as Orochimaru held the key to open its container. Log wants to destroy it as it was created by Orochimaru's narcissism and greed, saying that when he escaped Orochimaru, he just created another. Log wants to destroy Orochimaru. Orochimaru returns, and says the manner of their creation is irrelevant, and that he loves them the same. Orochimaru and Log each press on their opinion onto Mitsuki, causing him to snap and activate his Sage Transformation, stating that as a child, he is not interested in what they, the adults think. He takes the container and the key and leaves. Orochimaru comments Mitsuki's achievement with Log, revealed to be the hooded individual Orochimaru talked to earlier. Orochimaru is glad that on the sixth try, Mitsuki was able to make his own decision, not wanting to erase his memory again for a seventh. Orochimaru hopes that by find a sun who will show Mitsuki the light, Mitsuki himself can be a moon that illuminates the darkness. Inside the container, Mitsuki finds a photo of Boruto.

When Konohamaru explains that as new shinobi fresh from the Academy, they'll only receive low-rank missions at first. Boruto thinks they should just get those missions over with, so they can get higher ranked missions. Naruto overhears him and says no missions is something one just get over with. Their first mission is to expel bandits from a small village called Green Banks. Due to a drought, both Green Banks and neighboring farming villages have had poor harvests, and Green Banks is having its food stolen from storehouses. Boruto still thinks the mission to be easy, and when Konohamaru says the team should take the assignment more seriously, angering Sarada for lumping her with Boruto. Naruto tells them that even as a D rank mission, it is important and that they should give it their all. At home, Boruto asks Hinata about her first mission. She recalls being nervous back then, as there were wars, and missions were more dangerous. She tells him his first mission isn't really something to be excited about. Team 7 departs for their mission. Naruto tells Shikamaru he has filled Konohamaru in on the details of the mission and remembers Shikadai is also having his first mission. His mission is to escort a rich lady around. Shikadai and Inojin carry her purchases, while Ch\u014dch\u014d engages in conversation with her. On the way to Green Banks, Sarada tells Boruto not to do anything that would reflect poorly on her record, as not to hinder her path to becoming Hokage. As the two bicker, Mitsuki comments they get along well; angering both. Konohamaru stresses the importance of what Naruto told them and adds that they should not try resolving things on their own. A rustle nearby gets the genin on edge, but it's just a wild boar, and Konohamaru comments they have a long way to go if they get startled so easily. They reach a suspended bridge to Green Banks and ring a bell to announce themselves. Kiri sees they're children and doubts their skills, but lowers the bridge nonetheless. Team 7 is informed of the recent passing of the previous village leader around the time the attacks started, and that his daughter has taken over his position. They're introduced to Kiri, who informs them that as they've been able to deal with bandits on their own for a while, other villages have also hired shinobi. Konohamaru asks the genin to speak with Kiri in private. Konohamaru tells Kiri that conflict with other shinobi would make it at least a B rank mission, which he believes the genin are not prepared for. While the three discuss the implications of not completing the mission, they hear a commotion, find an enemy shinobi has killed a villager and Boruto engages in combat. Konohamaru interferes when Boruto is attacked, and Ashimaru is told to retreat. Konohamaru tells Kiri to be honest with them, as they can't make a strategy without knowing that the other village is really after. Kiri reveals they want the deed to the bridge. The enemy shinobi are informed about Konoha's involvement. At night, they attack again by setting one of the houses on fire. Boruto saves a villager from being attacked and other villagers start attacking them. Konohamaru determines they're being controlled with genjutsu. The villager Boruto saved holds Kiri hostage. Sarada tries locating the genjutsu user with her Sharingan, but fails. Mitsuki uses his Wind Release to knock down the controlled villagers, figuring anyone strong enough to resist it should be the enemy shinobi. All the villagers are knocked down, and Boruto notices Kiri has been taken, determining the one who got her must be working with the enemy.

Konohamaru confirms the involvement of Pale Blue Valley hired shinobi when a ransom note demands the bridge's deed in exchange for Kiri's life. With Kiri in captivity, Iori confesses to be working for the Pale Blue Valley, having done so since killing her father. He was offered a lot of money for the bridge deed, and counted on Kiri to fail by trying to resolve the issue all by herself, but didn't count on her hiring Konoha shinobi. The Green Banks villagers offer Konohamaru the deed, and ask the team to save Kiri. Team Konohamaru plans on how to rescue her. Iori delivers Kiri to Hidari, and is killed by Ashimaru, telling him they're former shinobi. Hidari proposes trading Kiri for the deed to Konohamaru. Konohamaru makes the trade, but Hidari tries disposing of him with an explosive tag left on Iori's corpse. Hidari and Ashimaru attack Konohamaru, who tosses Kiri aside for Boruto to catch. Konohamaru insists the genin to take Kiri away while he deals with Hidari and Ashimaru. Hidari manages to immobilise Konohamaru with a trap, and sends Ashimaru to deal with the genin. They stop and set up traps so they can tend to Kiri's injury. Kiri explains how her need to do things alone stems from having to live up to her father's reputation. Ashimaru catches up to them, and they decide to fight him. Hidari goes in to kill Konohamaru, who forcefully dispels his jutsu with a Wind Release: Rasengan. Konohamaru deliberately misses his attack, and Hidari faints in disbelief of the damage. Mitsuki and Boruto engage Ashimaru while Sarada analyses him with her Sharingan. She determines Ashimaru doesn't bother dodging attacks, just blocking them and counterattacking. Boruto and Mitsuki employ Wind Release to send Sarada towards Ashimaru at high speeds, her Sharingan allowing her to read his attacks, avoiding his counterattack and landing her own finishing blow. Konohamaru catches up with them, deed in hand. They return Kiri and the deed to Green Banks, where Kiri apologises for trying to take everything on her own.

They return the pet to its owner. Boruto voices his displeasure with the simple, neighbourhood based missions they've been assigned so far. Sarada points out those are the missions usually assigned to genin. At the mission assignment desk, Boruto requests a flashier mission. Konohamaru points out that Boruto probably got the wrong impression about missions, since missions with combat against other shinobi, like his first mission, are very rare in times of peace. Konohamaru points out their former classmates are also doing similarly low-key missions, and adds that through these missions, they get to learn about the village. Boruto asks if Naruto fed him that line. A news report informs them that an armed robbery was stopped by Kiba and Rock Lee. Boruto buys a newly released game, a sequel to a game he really likes, and offers to teach Mitsuki so they can play together. Sarada informs Boruto and Mitsuki they've been summoned by Konohamaru to deal with a bank robber, which sparks Boruto's interest. Boruto is disappointed by the scene at the bank. They're greeted by captain K\u014dtar\u014d F\u016bma of the police force, who is in charge of the situation. There are no hostages, and their mission is to talk the robber out of exploding himself along with the bank. Despite being disappointed by the situation, Boruto is still committed to finish the mission. He goes inside the bank by himself, trying to act as a negotiator, and then as a hostage for the robber, all the while noting the robbers ineptitude. Boruto doesn't find Haguruma to be someone who would rob a bank, and Haguruma tells him how he was fired from his job. He was a game programmer, and after he and his team had to deal with an unforgiving schedule, they decided to file a complaint against their boss. The boss somehow learned of it, and fabricated evidence that Haguruma was selling company secrets to rivals, leading to his firing. After being made an example for the other employees, no other company would hire him, and with no income, his debts piled up. Boruto identifies with Haguruma when he mentions not longer caring about the job since others didn't know what befell him. Haguruma feels better having told Boruto his story, and activates the bomb. He feels blowing himself up the day the last game he worked on is released will be a good final protest against his boss. Boruto reveals he just bought the game, and that he was a great fan of the first one. Boruto's passion for the games moves Haguruma, who gives up blowing himself up. When he can't deactivate the bomb because of issues with the trigger, Boruto instead fries the device with Lightning Release. Boruto comes out of the bank with Haguruma. At the police station, the captain informs the team that after seeing that the device would not have caused any casualties, and that Haguruma was under extreme emotional duress, his punishment is not likely to be severe. When Mitsuki asks what Haguruma will do now, Boruto asks Denki to find him a job at his family's company. Captain K\u014dtar\u014d informs Konohamaru that someone instigated Haguruma into barricading himself in the bank. Just then, a fellow officer gives him surprising news.

Outside the vault, Sarada finds a frozen flower. Five days go by without any developments. Denki explains to Boruto that noble thieves steal from the rich to give to the poor. Boruto asks Shikadai his opinion on it, and is surprised when Shikadai answers they must have their reasons, as there is more to what they know and learned in the Academy. Their talk is keeping Shikadai from understanding a sh\u014dgi strategy he's studying. Sarada makes a breakthrough on the case, and informs Boruto and Mitsuki on her theory on an Ice Release user, who would have brought their body temperature down as not to trigger the thermal sensors. At Boruto's suggestion, they don't report their findings so as to be kept in the loop of the investigation. Boruto takes them to Katasuke to find out more about Ice Release without alerting the investigation. Shikadai saves a child from injuring himself too seriously when playing with explosive tags, and a bystander picks up a sh\u014dgi piece he drops. Katasuke confirms their Ice Release theory, and shows them a more clandestine side of Konoha where they might find the Byakuya Gang. They find a posting about selling the stolen jewels.

Shikadai offers him the set, having more at home, hoping to play against him again the next day. Shikadai asks his father to teach him new tactics, and Shikamaru gets carried away, angering Temari when he ignores her call for dinner. Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki meet with the thief, pretending to be a buyer. The thief they're meeting is a decoy, rigged with explosive tags. The real thief questions their allegiance to the rich, considering them to be thieves themselves. He uses the jewel for a distraction to flee, but leaves them a trail of frozen footprints to follow. They follow the footprints to a water system by a mountain side, and up the mountain side to an impoverished village. The thief traps them with ice, and reveals the jewel was already sold, its profit used to fix the water system for the village. Boruto doesn't pursue the thief when he frees them, and later is conflicted about the case. The thief reports to a partner, who says another plan is already set up. The thief leaves for guard duty.

Iwabee pursues them as they flee, and blocks their escape with earth walls. However, they easily break free, and Metal is injured while protecting Denki from an icicle. At the hospital, Udon lectures Iwabee and tells him to stay home. They watch news reports on the Byakuya Gang, and see they are well-received by poorer populations. At home, Himawari asks Hinata about the gang, and while Boruto agrees with helping those in need, he disagrees with hurting others to do so, and considers Naruto responsible, seeing the social inequities at question to be due to his ineffectiveness.

One day, his father returned home fatally injured from a mission. When Ry\u014dgi's mother tried to help, she was also killed in front of him. The assailant tried attacking Ry\u014dgi, who tapped into his Ice Release abilities to stop him before passing out. When he woke up, Gekk\u014d told him he killed the man who attacked him, and that the funeral for his parents was over. Gekk\u014d offered to teach Ry\u014dgi, who accepted the offer. Gekk\u014d introduced Ry\u014dgi to the Byakuya Gang, claiming it to be the real job he and his father did besides shinobi work. Gekk\u014d claimed that he and Ry\u014dgi's father began questioning their role as shinobi, tasked with only fulfilling missions as ordered by those above them, acting as pawns.

He wants Team 5 to show him flashy ninjutsu, so Iwabee raises the ground, Lee attacks it, and then throws shuriken at Denki, who substitutes out of their way. The director is pleased with the eye-catching footage, but Udon points out they're scaring the civilians, and withdraws Team 5 from the mission. Later, Iwabee tries throwing his forehead protector in frustration, but is stopped by Lee. Udon asks if they want to be suspended again, and Iwabee questions how someone cool like Udon could possibly understand them. Udon shares how he failed to graduate several times, and how he messed up missions as a genin. Iwabee ponders about Udon's earlier words on looking cool on film. At night, determined not to let their efforts go to waste, the filming crew decides to detonate some explosive tags they had set up on a condemned building to get some shots. Not satisfied with the shots, they do inside, and the building starts to collapse on top of them. Lee saves them from falling debris, and Denki analyses the situation. When the roof collapses, Iwabee protects them from a falling crane, and Udon stops the debris with his snot-based jutsu. In the confusion, Iwabee loses his forehead protector, and the filming crew requests them to be the ones on the documentary again.

Mitsuki surmises there's only one White Zetsu, as the flower is dried up, so without chakra, it can't incubate more Zetsu.

Momoshiki and Kinshiki scoff at Naruto and Sasuke's assertion what they use isn't true power. Momoshiki eats a chakra pill, and produces an attack by amplifying the many jutsu he has absorbed. Momoshiki sends a fire pheasant at them, but Naruto blocks it by manifesting Kurama's head and creates shadow clones to protect civilians still in the arena. Momoshiki sends several elemental attacks through the arena. Sasuke armours Kurama's head with his Susanoo. Meanwhile, Urashiki blocks Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d's water spike with his fishing rod, and produces a Lightning Release he absorbed from Mitsuki from his gourd. Urashiki sees through Gaara's sand, and uses sand of his own to counter it. Urashiki produces many fishing hooks to attack Gaara, but is blocked by a massive water vortex Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d created with underground water, which Gaara dug up for him with his sand. Urashiki activates his tomoe Rinnegan and escapes, but not before taunting them with his clansmens' work on the arena. Naruto resists Momoshiki's attack, impressing him, so he consumes more chakra pills, creating a massive attack. Naruto asks Sasuke to protect the children, and fully manifests Kurama's form. He considers using a Tailed Beast Ball to counter the attack, but chooses against it. Sasuke explains to Boruto that Naruto could have easily countered the attack, but doing so would damage a lot of the surrounding area. From all over Konoha, people watch Naruto take the full force of Momoshiki's attack. As it detonates, Boruto experiences Naruto's memories through his chakra, and cries out as the blast reaches him.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "63", "Episode Title": "Sasuke's_Secret_Weapon", "Japanese Airdate": "28 June 2018", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto wakes up in the hospital.

Boruto notices he's still wearing his Shinobi Gauntlet after tripping on a medical kit, and angrily throws it away. Upon waking up, Hinata asks about Naruto, and Sasuke assures her he's fine, and to leave the rest to him. Boruto goes to Naruto's office, thinking about all the times he complained about Naruto. He finds and wears Naruto's old clothes. Sasuke tells Boruto he's in a similar situation Naruto used to be, scorned by others. He reveals he can still sense Naruto's chakra, and that he intends to rescue him with Boruto's help. The other Kage arrive, saying they'll help, so everyone pools all of their knowledge of each of the \u014ctsutsuki's abilities. The Kage question Sasuke's decision to bring Boruto along, but he assures them he has a reason. Sasuke hands Boruto his own forehead protector with Naruto's scratch on it and explains the history behind it. As Sasuke, Boruto, and the Kage prepare to leave, Sarada asks Sasuke to go with them. He instructs her to help Kakashi and Shikamaru protect the village, as she's the only other person with the Sharingan. Boruto tries apologising to Shikadai, but he says they have more pressing matters, and that he'll listen to what he has to say later. Sasuke opens a portal with his Rinnegan. Hinata arrives, and is shocked to see Boruto in Naruto's old clothes. The sight reminds her of her husband when he was younger, and that moves Hinata to entrust Naruto's safety to her son.

Sarada informs Mitsuki of how things turned out after he was attacked. In a wasteland where a God Tree resides, Momoshiki drains Kurama's chakra from Naruto. Kinshiki explains that this God Tree was created from a man who also harboured a Tailed Beast, who Naruto understands to be Killer B. Momoshiki complains about how long the process is taking, having only absorbed half of the chakra in Naruto. Naruto says he won't make it easy for them, that as shinobi, they've had to persevere to develop their abilities. Momoshiki explains how they're able to effortlessly acquire power, which Naruto links to the Shinobi Gauntlet, blaming himself for ignoring Boruto to the point it drove him to rely on the Scientific Ninja Tool. Momoshiki resumes extracting his chakra. The other four Kage arrive, interrupting Momoshiki, and cutting Naruto free from his restraints. The Kage fight Momoshiki and Kinshiki while Sasuke and Boruto check on Naruto. Naruto notices Boruto is wearing his old clothes. Naruto apologises for ignoring Boruto, sharing a bit of his own mischievous past. Boruto asks Naruto to tell him his story after they go back home. In Konoha, Shikamaru instructs other shinobi to make sure no one else is missing, and to be on the lookout for Urashiki. Shikadai asks him if they shouldn't send reinforcements. Shikamaru sees his concern for Boruto is like his for Naruto. He explains their current situation using shogi analogies. Sasuke fights Kinshiki, who has to dodge an attack from Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d instead of landing a hit on Sasuke. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d allows himself to be hit, so a concealed Kurotsuchi can land a hit on him, sending him flying for Sasuke's strike. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Kurotsuchi pin Kinshiki down. The others focus on Momoshiki, Gaara using his sand to offer others footing while pursuing him. Boruto warns Naruto of Momoshiki's ability to absorb and amplify any ninjutsu used against him. Momoshiki notices Kinshiki has been incapacitated, and upon checking Boruto with his Byakugan, notices how Naruto is unable to pass on his power to him, and offers to show how his clan does it. He converts Kinshiki into a chakra edible and consumes it, Sasuke attempts to strike him but fails. Momoshiki's appearance changes, including manifesting a third Rinnegan on his forehead, and tells Naruto he's next.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "65", "Episode Title": "Father_and_Child", "Japanese Airdate": "19 July 2018", "episode synopsis text": "The shinobi are horrified by Momoshiki's consuming of Kinshiki for power, who replies it was the former's wish, and law within their clan. Momoshiki releases a pulse of energy that cuts clean through the God Tree, and pushes everyone back. Momoshiki flies towards Darui and Gaara, kicking Darui away before he can react. Gaara manages to catch Momoshiki with his sand, but Momoshiki uses his hair to bind and strangle him, loosing Gaara's grip on him, allowing Momoshiki to toss him aside. Momoshiki proceeds to knock out Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Kurotsuchi. Momoshiki targets Naruto, and the two engage with taijutsu, and the latter gains the upper hand when he strikes Naruto's tenketsu. Sasuke attacks Momoshiki, who evades his attack, counterattacks, and rams both Naruto and Sasuke on the ground, throwing them against the remains of the God Tree. Naruto and Sasuke go on the offensive, activating their chakra mode and d\u014djutsu respectively, and Momoshiki manifests a weapon to counter them. Sasuke unseals a f\u016bma shuriken, which he electrifies, and guides at Momoshiki with wires. Naruto multiplies them. Momoshiki dodges some, but as he begins to get hit, he unleashes an energy pulse to repel them. Momoshiki narrowly avoids a f\u016bma shuriken that comes from underground, breaking through the God Tree stump they're fighting on. The f\u016bma shuriken is a transformed Naruto, who throws a Rasenshuriken at Momoshiki. Just before it hits, the Rasenshuriken transforms back into Sasuke. Momoshiki binds Sasuke with manifested chains, but Sasuke switches places with Momoshiki, leaving him bound and open to a strike by Naruto. Sasuke uses the opportunity to trap Momoshiki with Chibaku Tensei. Momoshiki breaks free by manifesting a wooden dragon, which Naruto and Sasuke break. Momoshiki lands on the God Tree stump, using it to manifest more wooden dragons. One of them catches Sasuke, and Momoshiki channels an explosion through it. Naruto manifests Kurama and protects Sasuke. Momoshiki coalesces the rocks around into a monkey in retaliation. Sasuke armours Naruto with Susanoo, and they cut through Momoshiki's monkey. Boruto watches the fight in awe. Naruto and Sasuke power down, and the other Kage ask if they're done. Kurotsuchi wants to use a flashy jutsu to end him, but Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Gaara point out he'd absorb them and regain strength. Katasuke arrives with K\u014dsuke, and against the others' warnings, fires several ninjutsu at Momoshiki with the Shinobi Gauntlet. Momoshiki absorbs them, regaining strength, and uses the absorbed jutsu against them. Gaara protects the group with his sand, but before they can strike back, Momoshiki paralyses them with an absorbed Nara shadow ninjutsu, and for extra measure, pins Naruto down with black receivers. Boruto remembers Sasuke's words from before, and on Sasuke's command, throws his Rasengan. Naruto wonders when Boruto learned it, while Momoshiki thinks he should have stayed out of sight. He prepares to absorb it, but it vanishes before reaching him, so he turns his attention back to the shinobi. Boruto's attack connects, breaking Momoshiki's hold on the others. Sasuke explains to Naruto how he trained Boruto on the condition he learned the Rasengan. Momoshiki consumes more chakra pills to power up for decisive attack. Naruto tells Boruto to make another Rasengan, and adds his chakra to enlarge it. Sasuke distracts Momoshiki, throwing his sword and switching places with it to get close. Sasuke's sword is a transformed Boruto, who throws a kunai. Momoshiki catches it, and Sasuke switches it with his Chidori, so Momoshiki strikes his own arm, while Sasuke uses the kunai to stab the Rinnegan on his hand, preventing him from using it to absorb jutsu. Boruto uses clones to distract Momoshiki, allowing his real self to attack with the Naruto-powered Rasengan. Momoshiki counters with a similar attack, but Boruto prevails. As his body is destroyed, Momoshiki's spirit talks to Boruto, recognising that he strongly inherited \u014ctsutsuki powers. He gives Boruto a cryptic information about his future and a warning him that his victory means he can't stay an ordinary human, grabbing his arm before disappearing. Katasuke is confused about recent events, unsure of what happened. Momoshiki's chakra receivers vanish.

Naruto, Sasuke, and Shikamaru discuss how they're still targets of the \u014ctsutsuki, as Urashiki escaped and they still don't know the true extent of his powers. Sasuke says he'll leave to track Urashiki. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss how they still got to see the skills of the participants, requiring meeting with the other villages to discuss the outcome. Shikamaru also points out Naruto has to deal with Katasuke, and informs him that Killer B returned to Kumogakure. Naruto wants to take time off, but Shikamaru advises to finish handling his paperwork first. At the mission assignment desk, Team 7 talks to Team 5, who are glad to see Mitsuki has recovered. Team 10 comes by, having finished a mission. Boruto and Shikadai ride the train, the situation between them awkward. They both apologise to each other; Boruto for having cheated, Shikadai for making Boruto wait so long to talk to him when he said he would after the attack on the exam. They talk about the type of shinobi they want to be. On the train back to Sunagakure, Shinki thinks how Boruto, who he perceives as weak, went against a much stronger opponent and won. Gaara claims responsibility for telling him not to fight, but Shinki says that even if he had fought, he'd have lost. Gaara tells him to focus on his own path instead of the paths of others beside him. Sasuke talks to Boruto, who informs him that he hasn't seen Momoshiki again, nor felt the same paralysis he felt before. Sasuke tells Boruto to keep him updated. Sarada asks Sasuke to help her perfect her Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. A snake clone Orochimaru meets with Mitsuki in person to talk to him about Mitsuki almost using senjutsu in public. Boruto is interviewed for his participation in the fight against the \u014ctsutsuki. Sarada asks if Boruto intends to become Hokage, but he denies it, saying that is her dream, while he wants to become like Sasuke. After she and Mitsuki leave, he undoes his bandages, thinking back to Momoshiki's words, looking at the diamond-shaped mark on his right hand. Boruto arrives home to find Naruto, who brought home a cake to make up for missing Himawari's and Boruto's birthdays. Boruto punches him in the stomach to make sure he's not a shadow clone. When Himawari jumps on the two, Hinata threatens to put the cake away. Naruto and Boruto both wake up late the next day, and fist bump before they head to handle their respective duties. In the dimension where Momoshiki was defeated, Urashiki realises Boruto is the one Toneri was observing, and notes he could pose a threat in the future, wondering if preventive measures should be taken, but sure it'll be interesting either way.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "67", "Episode Title": "Super_Ch\u014dch\u014d_Butterfly_Mode!", "Japanese Airdate": "2 August 2018", "episode synopsis text": "During a training session, Ch\u014dji demonstrates some of their clan's secret techniques to Ch\u014dch\u014d, but she is distracted watching T.V.

Boruto finds it depressing, and the two consider how Mitsuki never spoke of parents and his home village. They see a portrait of Boruto by his bed. Boruto asks the other genin if they've seen Mitsuki. Inojin thinks Boruto would know where to find him. Ch\u014dch\u014d says all the j\u014dnin have been summoned by the Hokage, even when most missions were cancelled that day. Boruto and Sarada inform Konohamaru that Mitsuki is missing, and notice he's hiding something when he brushes them off. Boruto and Sarada eavesdrop on a high-level meeting, where they speculate who might be behind the attack on the guards and why. Tsunade arrives, having heard of the attack. Sai has Konohamaru confirm the forehead protector he found is Mitsuki's. They consider Mitsuki might have been the target, while Tsunade is unaware of who Mitsuki is. Because of the situation, they also call in Homura and Koharu. Ino checks the guards' memories of the attack, and sees Mitsuki leaving with the assailants on his own. Boruto and Sarada don't know what to make of it. Konohamaru considers Mitsuki might have an ulterior motive, and suggests contacting Mitsuki's guardian. Naruto reveals to those who don't know that Mitsuki is Orochimaru's son. Tsunade is angry and the advisers consider Mitsuki to be as dangerous as Orochimaru. Naruto says he's accepted Mitsuki as a shinobi, and Shikamaru adds that Orochimaru's research will be important when fighting the \u014ctsutsuki. Boruto and Sarada discuss Mitsuki's loyalty, and how there is much they don't know about him. Sarada says that as shinobi, they must consider every possibility. Boruto wonders if the Hokage Sarada wants to be just has amazing skills. He then admonishes her for not giving Mitsuki the benefit of the doubt before leaving. Shikadai informs Boruto the village is under increased security alert, that a tracking team is being assembled to look for Mitsuki, and warns Boruto not to do anything stupid. Near the attack site, Boruto finds one of Mitsuki's snakes being attacked by the remnant of one of the attackers. Boruto defeats the remnant, and the snake relays a recorded message to Boruto that this is Mitsuki's will. At night, Boruto prepares to leave for find Mitsuki and confirm his message. Despite the danger, Sarada joins him, and wants to take the snake to Orochimaru to get more information about it.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "73", "Episode Title": "The_Other_Side_of_the_Moon", "Japanese Airdate": "13 September 2018", "episode synopsis text": "While on the way to Orochimaru's lab, Sarada warns Boruto that it's guarded by j\u014dnin, so they have to be careful not to get caught. Yamato informs Orochimaru of Mitsuki's escape, and tells Orochimaru to inform him if Mitsuki makes contact. At Konoha, the leadership discusses the merits of Naruto's decision to allow Mitsuki into the village and to proceed. Udon informs them that Boruto and Sarada have gone missing. As Shikadai is likely to know how Boruto will act, Shikamaru considers having his team go after them. Konohamaru asks to go, as the missing genin are his responsibility. He is conflicted about Mitsuki, and asks Naruto why he placed him on his team. Naruto wanted Konohamaru to get to know Mitsuki without the possible bias of knowing he's Orochimaru's son getting in the way, but regrets that Konohamaru had to find out like this. Shikamaru doesn't allow him to go. Inojin and Ch\u014dch\u014d wonder how Boruto and Sarada came to go after Mitsuki. Shikadai is more concerned with the village turning on them. Moegi arrives and they depart to retrieve Boruto and Sarada. Sarada disguises herself as Mitsuki and draws the j\u014dnin away from Orochimaru's lair, allowing Boruto to slip in unnoticed. While looking for Orochimaru, Boruto finds a tank with a Mitsuki clone growing in it. Suigetsu finds him, and Orochimaru introduces himself to Boruto. Orochimaru explains to Boruto that all the Mitsuki are his experiments. He isn't worried about Mitsuki's disappearance, as if anyone discovers Mitsuki's nature as his experiment, a cursed seal in him will activate, self-destructing Mitsuki so the secrets of his research will remain safe. Boruto is disconcerted about what Orochimaru is actually worried about. The j\u014dnin trap Sarada in a barrier, but Karin rescues her, tells her Boruto is waiting for her, and transforms into Mitsuki to draw the j\u014dnin away from her. Boruto hands Orochimaru the snake Mitsuki left behind and relays the message it gave him. Orochimaru agrees to further examine the snake. Sarada meets up with Boruto, who asks her if she knew about Mitsuki, having been to that lab before, and shows her the Mitsuki clones. Orochimaru discusses Mitsuki with Log. Karin reveals her ruse to Yamato and escapes. Orochimaru informs the genin the snake had no other messages, distressing Boruto, who fixates on Mitsuki. Orochimaru explains it was Mitsuki's decision to go to Konoha, and asks him what he'll do if it's also his decision to leave it. Boruto and Sarada discuss how they've treated Mitsuki. Boruto confirms to Orochimaru he still trusts Mitsuki, so Orochimaru instructs them to take the snake to the White Snake Sage at Ry\u016bchi Cave so they can learn from the snake's own thoughts. Yamato returns to Orochimaru's lab, asking him why he sent Karin. Orochimaru denies it, and also denies that Boruto and Sarada were there when Yamato asks it.

Inojin tries sealing Boruto, while Ch\u014dch\u014d holds Sarada in place. Boruto destroys Inojin's sealing scroll with a Vanishing Rasengan, and Sarada frees herself with a flash bomb. Though they escape, Shikadai is confident he has discerned the pattern of their actions. In Konoha, Temari takes lunch to Shikamaru at work, and questions why Team 10 was assigned to retrieve Boruto and Sarada. Shikamaru says Shikadai has learned from the Byakuya Gang incident, so he'll act even if they're his friends. While Inojin does aerial reconnaissance, Moegi, Shikadai, and Ch\u014dch\u014d discuss Mitsuki, and how Boruto and Sarada going after him reflects on everyone else. Shikadai ponders why Sarada, who's so level-headed, would also go off after Mitsuki. Inojin reports there are two sets of Boruto and Sarada. They split up to go after both sets. Moegi defeats the decoys, and the genin catch up to them, having flown with Inojin's drawn beasts. Shikadai is able to predict their strategy, and through a ruse with Inojin, is able to pin down Boruto and Sarada. Shikadai notices Mitsuki's snake with them. Shikamaru elaborates to Temari that he thinks there's more to Mitsuki's disappearance, and that Boruto and Sarada may have found a clue, so he's counting on Shikadai to discover what it is, and make a decision based on it. Learning of the contents of Mitsuki's message and the circumstances of its discovery, Shikadai decides to join Boruto and Sarada, to everyone's surprise. On her way to the genin, Moegi is attacked by an unknown assailant, and fights back. Shikadai explains how all the inconsistencies of Mitsuki's departure add up. Despite still not being convinced Mitsuki is innocent, he agrees that the best way to learn the truth is from Mitsuki himself. Ch\u014dch\u014d decides to join in so Moegi doesn't yell at her for failing to stop them, and Inojin does it so he won't be the only one left behind. The assailant counters Moegi's Water Release with the very same jutsu, and falls back, leading her to realise he was just stalling for time. Moegi gets exasperated when she finds an apology from her genin. Boruto and Sarada explain to the others where they're going and why.

She notices footprints on the ground, and discerning they're theirs, realises they've been going in circles. Boruto says they have to keep going. They're watched by three ornately dressed women, who upon noting they're not simply lost, decide to check them out. The genin arrive at a richly decorated gate to Ry\u016bchi Cave, finding it not to be what they expected, and are greeted by a hostess. The hostess introduces herself as Tagorihime, who welcomes them to relax. Boruto asks about the White Snake Sage, and Tagorihime says he's in a temple, and can arrange for Boruto to meet him. Inojin and Ch\u014dch\u014d begin to eat, despite Boruto's warnings about what kind of place Ry\u016bchi Cave is supposed to be. Though not as eager, Sarada and Shikadai accept Tagorihime's hospitality, while Boruto remains suspicious. When Tagorihime mentions Mitsuki, Boruto notices they didn't mention the name to her, and alerts the others. Tagorihime's face distorts into that of a snake as she says they should have just eaten the food. The facade of their location dissolves. Tagorihime laments missing out on eating the chakra of children, and a voice in the fog speaks to her, reminding her they didn't fail the test to weed out those searching for Ry\u016bchi Cave. Tagorihime retreats into the fog, telling them not to assume they'll survive until the end. They venture deeper into the fog, towards the next source of light. They get separated in the fog, and Boruto follows another figure into the cave. A door closes behind him, and he notices the door has grooves where stone bits in the room fit. Ichikishimahime congratulates him, always disappearing when Boruto looks at her and reappearing elsewhere. She explains he'll only be able to leave if he fills out all the spaces on the boulder. Revealing her snake face, Ichikishimahime explains she doesn't like fresh chakra, and prefers faint, weak chakra she can drink. Boruto takes his time filling the wall, but there's one groove none of the stones fit into. Boruto doesn't want to waste time there when he can search for Mitsuki. Ichikishimahime asks if Boruto is there to acquire the Sage's power, and he says he's only there to find Mitsuki. Boruto breaks a stone by accident, and thinks to break other stones to make them fit the last groove. Boruto passes the trial, and is bitten by another snakewoman, Tagitsuhime, who says she'll test his heart. Boruto begins to see visions of his friends berating him for being inconsiderate of others and endangering them. Boruto is resolute in finding Mitsuki, and passes the trial. Tagitsuhime says he has earned the right to meet the White Snake Sage, and that his friends are up ahead. He finds them unconscious, but unharmed, and wakes them up. They meet up with the White Snake Sage, and explain Orochimaru pointed them in his direction. The Sage comments on how Orochimaru has changed. The Sage follows up explaining the trials he went through were for learning senjutsu, but Boruto reiterates his goal, something the Sage is uninterested in helping with. However, the Sage agrees to help on the condition of dealing with Garaga, a giant snake that has been troubling the Sage, by bringing to her Garaga's reverse scale.

The genin recall the Sage's explanation of Garaga going into frenzies over having lost an eye in battle. They get startled when coming across some snake statues, and find Garaga, who attacks them. Shikadai tries paralysing him, but Garaga is too big for him and breaks through his jutsu. Boruto spots Garaga's reverse scale, but Garaga moves before he can attack. Sarada is thrown aside by Garaga's movement, and is almost eaten, but another snake intervenes, biting Garaga, giving the genin a chance to escape.

Sarada thinks the blue snake was trying to protect her. The blue snake finds them, and introduces himself as Aoda, a summoning snake who has pledged loyalty to Sasuke. Garaga has a fit over Aoda's interference. The genin explain their situation to Aoda. Shikadai notices Aoda doesn't have a reverse scale, and asks if Garaga's the only one who does. Aoda explains most violent snakes have them, and that they become milder once their reverse scale is removed. Aoda wants to escort them back to Konoha, but Sarada insists on their task.

He saves Boruto from another attack, who thanks him for his quick drawing. Inojin points out he didn't draw that fast, but used the drawing he was riding when he was attacked, which Garaga didn't destroy. This gives Shikadai an idea of how to counter Garaga. Shikadai deduces Garaga is tracking them through heat, which Inojin's drawings don't emit. Using shadow clones to throw Garaga off, Boruto is able to land a Vanishing Rasengan on Garaga's Reverse Scale, giving the others an opportunity to use explosive tags to collapse the ceiling on top of him. Garaga emerges from the rubble, so Shikadai tries holding him with his shadow, while Boruto propels himself to get the scale. Garaga opens his blind eye. Boruto enters Garaga's mind, and learns how Garaga lost his eye, when he acted as a summoning snake for a shinobi. His summoner wanted to retreat during a battle, but he wanted to keep fighting, so his summoner used Lightning Release against him, costing him his eye. Boruto explains why they need his scale, and the two argue about betrayal, Garaga wanting to see how Mitsuki's betrayal will lead to Boruto's death. Boruto decides not to take Garaga's scale by force, but decides to enter a summoning contract with him, so he'll be able to see if Boruto fails to bring Mitsuki back. Garaga agrees, adding that he'll eat Boruto if he fails. They return to the White Snake Sage, Ch\u014dch\u014d restored, and when she asks about the scale, Boruto summons Garaga. The White Snake Sage reveals her true form, and shows them Mitsuki's snake's thoughts. Mitsuki had the snake stop the hearts of the guards to convince the assailants they were dead.

From the normal appearance of things in Iwagakure, Shikadai surmises that Kokuy\u014d was no ordinary shinobi, and is likely affiliated with a clandestine group with no formal ties to Iwagakure. While discussing their next step, Ch\u014dch\u014d's stomach growls loudly, drawing attention from the crowd, including Akatsuchi. They draw attention of a diner owner, and get in to eat so Ch\u014dch\u014d will stop drawing attention. Their knowledge of \u014cnoki impresses the diner owner, and they get him to tell them where \u014cnoki lives. Akatsuchi follows them from a distance. Inojin has the Akuta pick a new name for itself, and it picks Akkun. The genin arrive at \u014cnoki's residence, and are met by Akatsuchi, who informs them the Hokage told them they might show up, and that Kurotsuchi has disappeared, while a cover story was released. He tells them \u014cnoki is probably in the old part of Iwagakure, and that he'll be happy to see someone he invited. Akatsuchi takes them to see \u014cnoki, who is happy to see them, but denies being able to help them. After he leaves, the genin and Akatsuchi are attacked by a group of Akuta.

Naruto calls Kurotsuchi's office, and Kontsuchi picks up, informing him that she still hasn't returned and it might be a while before she does, and that there no new developments that require immediate attention. Kontsuchi is being controlled by Kirara through genjutsu. Naruto and Shikamaru suspect something is up, and hope to hear from Konohamaru. On his way to Iwagakure, Konohamaru finds paralysed Konoha shinobi. Akatsuchi demands explanations from \u014cnoki. \u014cnoki orders K\u016b to release Boruto, who asks what he meant by for the sake of peace. \u014cnoki claims it's to prevent the repeating of a tragedy. Five years prior, Iwagakure was attacked by rogue ninja, and many young shinobi lost their lives. He points out Konoha was also recently attacked, by the \u014ctsutsuki. He wants there to be someone to fight these threats instead of risking the lives of the youth, and that Mitsuki will help him with that. Sekiei meets up with Mitsuki, telling him he has to take him to K\u016b. He shows Mitsuki to his room, and shows them how the Akuta are created. Mitsuki notices there are many, and Sekiei explains they'll soon have more Akuta than there are shinobi in Iwagakure to protect young lives. Mitsuki asks if they'll die in their place. Kokuy\u014d and Kak\u014d arrive, and are displeased with Sekiei showing Mitsuki around. Sekiei takes Mitsuki to see his room, and Kak\u014d volunteers to end Mitsuki already, while Kokuy\u014d wants to wait for further orders. \u014cnoki says Mitsuki will help him with the final stage of their plans, but Shikadai points out that if it gets out that he harmed Konoha shinobi, the Hokage will take action. \u014cnoki says he planned to do everything in secret, and has no intention of hurting them. Boruto begins fighting K\u016b, who has the Akuta attack as well. They discover their masks are their weak spot when one of them collapses when Sarada destroys it. K\u016b imprisons Boruto with an earth barrier, which Akatsuchi breaks with his earth golem. K\u016b destroys Akatsuchi's golem with Dust Release. The genin want to retreat to their rendezvous point. K\u016b exchanges blows with Akatsuchi, sending him flying towards a pillar, which collapses on top of \u014cnoki's vehicle. Boruto saves \u014cnoki. One of the Akuta manages to capture Shikadai. Kokuy\u014d and Kak\u014d hurry past Sekiei and Mitsuki, who finds it suspicious. Mitsuki asks about the drawings on Sekiei's room. Sekiei explains they're his, and that his master created them to protect the people he cherishes. Sekiei wants to create friendships worth protecting so he can get stronger. He asks Mitsuki for confirmation that humans grow stronger when they have someone to protect. Mitsuki is surprised by the question, but confirms it. Sekiei shows him a drawing of them. Shikadai is imprisoned in a cell next to Kurotsuchi. She recognises him as Shikamaru's son, and asks what he'd doing there. Shikadai begins explaining. A doctor arrives for Mitsuki's examination. It reveals the juinjutsu that would destroy Mitsuki to prevent information about Orochimaru's experiments being discovered. Kurotsuchi explains to Shikadai it all started when she rejected one of \u014cnoki's proposals in the wake of the attack five years prior. \u014cnoki created prototype Akuta to protect the village, but they misbehaved and attack them. Kurotsuchi disavowed their development, as the villages agreed to stand by each other in emergencies, and the Akuta development would jeopardise that. \u014cnoki continued his Akuta development in secret, as well as the artificial humans. Kurotsuchi and Shikadai plan to break out. K\u016b grows impatient with the Akuta being unable to find \u014cnoki.

Boruto presses him for further explanation of his plans. \u014cnoki insists it's for the sake of peace, and that young shinobi are now weak and unreliable. Boruto decides to leave him, but \u014cnoki informs him they're in the Sanzu Plains, which is surrounded by a powerful barrier that makes it difficult to leave once one is inside. \u014cnoki explains the plains are a shinobi training ground where one can only leave when they find their heart stone, a simple pebble that requires one to train intensely to find. Boruto tries using shadow clones to find it, but the barrier prevents him from using jutsu, and \u014cnoki explains no one else comes to the plains any more, so they're unlikely to be found by third parties. Kokuy\u014d and Kak\u014d report to K\u016b they have yet to find \u014cnoki. K\u016b wants them to deploy more Akuta for the search, confident that Kirara will be able to keep the villagers from noticing their presence, and dismisses Kak\u014d's suggestion to eliminate witnesses, as that would go against \u014cnoki's plan. Kirara shows Mitsuki her belongings. Kak\u014d passes on K\u016b's orders, and Sekiei explains to Mitsuki Konoha shinobi came looking for him, but K\u016b chased them away.

Sarada and Ch\u014dch\u014d arrive, telling him there are many Akuta around, and are concern when learning that Boruto and Shikadai haven't arrived. \u014cnoki gives Boruto food and water as thanks for saving him, and the two continue to forage for sustenance. \u014cnoki wants Boruto to admit that book learning during times of peace and plenty has made young shinobi weaker, and Boruto asks if he truly believes they were better off during times of war. \u014cnoki stresses that his point is about the value of experience and training, pointing out the presence of powerful enemies like the \u014ctsutsuki Boruto himself has fought. \u014cnoki explains that is why he created K\u016b and the others, K\u016b in particular made from his own cells. He invited Mitsuki to Iwagakure because he was made with similar technology, and could help him further develop synthetic humans to fight instead of risking young lives. Mitsuki meets K\u016b, who wants to analyse Mitsuki to learn more about how he was created. Mitsuki points out the juinjutsu on his heart, but K\u016b explains it's an old juinjutsu they can get around of with time. Mitsuki asks K\u016b about the will of synthetic individuals like themselves, and K\u016b advises him to ask the who created him. The two continue to discuss the nature of will.

While walking through the plains, Boruto stumbles across Sekki, an Iwagakure genin who failed out early in the last Ch\u016bnin Exams. \u014cnoki asks what he's doing there, and Sekki explains he's been looking for his Heart Stone. Sekki asks what Boruto is doing there with \u014cnoki, but before he can explain \u014cnoki's machinations, he assumes \u014cnoki did something heroic. \u014cnoki later asks Boruto why didn't tell Sekki the truth about him, and Boruto says it'd be no use. \u014cnoki tells Sekki Boruto will help him find his Heart Stone, telling Boruto under his breath that if he finds it, they'll be able to leave with Sekki. Sekiei thanks Mitsuki for coming while the two watch over Kirara and Kak\u014d. The doctor reports to K\u016b that the juinjutsu on Mitsuki's heart is making analysis difficult, and that to make use of the technology behind it, they'd need human hearts for each of the synthetic humans.

Konohamaru saves him. Boruto helps Sekki look for his Heart Stone. The two end up discussing, and Sekki attacks Boruto with his technique that doesn't require chakra. Boruto dodges it easily, but later notices the damage it caused to the rock Sekki hit. When \u014cnoki's back gives out, Sekki gives him a back rub, like he used to do for his grandmother. Something in the plains watches the three. Konohamaru determines the area most heavily guarded by the Akuta.

Boruto and Sekki go get more water, and are attacked by a giant wolf. Boruto has Sekki use his technique, and propels him so he can land the hit on the wolf. The stone he was holding during the attack turns out to be his Heart Stone, its side looking like Sekki's grandmother.

Kontsuchi is informed of what transpired while he was under genjutsu, and moves to notify the other villages, but K\u016b and the other synthetic humans have already taken control of Iwagakure with the Akuta. K\u016b is disappointed by Iwagakure's situation under Kurotsuchi, and leaves the Akuta under Kokuy\u014d's command. Kokuy\u014d informs him Shikadai has escaped, but K\u016b is more concerned with finding \u014cnoki. \u014cnoki explains how after the Fourth Shinobi World War, the villages suffered a massive loss of life, but Iwagakure managed to rebuild. Kozuchi was excited to become a genin, and wanted \u014cnoki to live long enough to see him become Tsuchikage. \u014cnoki told him one who is Tsuchikage must never run away and face every adversity. One day, when some shinobi tried to steal village secrets, Kozuchi tried to stop them and was fatally injured. When Kurotsuchi explained Kozuchi tried to stop them by himself until reinforcements arrived, \u014cnoki realised his words were the cause of that attitude, and blamed himself for his death. Wanting to actualise Kozuchi's will, \u014cnoki developed the Akuta to fight instead of risking the lives of young shinobi. One day, \u014cnoki was approached by a doctor who shared his opinion, and had made a discovery that was a breakthrough for his plan. They created K\u016b and the other fabrications to lead the Akuta. \u014cnoki explains he never intended there to be fighting, and will release the Konoha genin after his plan is completed. Boruto asks him what was the sample that the doctor showed him. \u014cnoki reveals it was a White Zetsu. Boruto is incredulous that \u014cnoki risked using something so dangerous, and \u014cnoki agrees there's much they don't know, and that is why they needed Mitsuki, to stabilise them. \u014cnoki assures him that Mitsuki will be free to do as he pleases after they stabilise the synthetic humans. K\u016b has taken control of Iwagakure and imprisoned those who tried to interfere. Five of the captured shinobi are to be used as sources of hearts for them if \u014cnoki approves. Boruto understands \u014cnoki's benevolent intentions, but points out that when he fought the synthetic humans, they had personalities, and wonders if they're really different from humans. \u014cnoki is confident that what Boruto sees as will in the fabrications are merely functions. Boruto asks if he truly believes that, pointing out how strongly \u014cnoki's belief in will is, recalling their conversation in Konohagakure. \u014cnoki is taken aback, but assures him he doesn't know about the fabrications. Boruto counters that he knows Mitsuki, and saw how they interacted, and knows Mitsuki has a will, pointing out \u014cnoki has no real proof the fabrications lack a will of their own.

Naruto prepares to depart, and Teams 5 and 15 request permission to go with him. Naruto refuses to endanger their lives, but they're willing to face the consequences of going without his permission. Naruto appreciates their dedication, and Sai and Shikamaru don't stop them from following. Sarada works on clearing the debris. Boruto admits they should get to know more of Mitsuki, but Sarada says they've done enough. The rest the debris gets cleared by Sekki, who explains \u014cnoki is with him. He asks Boruto to take him to K\u016b. K\u016b is impressed with Mitsuki's Sage Mode, and wants to use his body to create more Fabrications. Mitsuki constricts K\u016b with snakes, but he creates a golem to wield his sword and cut through the snakes, which forces Mitsuki out of Sage Mode. K\u016b prepares to further weaken Mitsuki, but \u014cnoki arrives with Boruto and Sarada. \u014cnoki asks K\u016b when he strayed from protecting the weak, and K\u016b says he's merely a vessel for the hatred \u014cnoki passed down to him. K\u016b prepares to kill the others, but they escape to an underground stream. \u014cnoki recalls Ishikawa's warning of his Will of Stone being replaced with hatred. He wakes up in that same room. Boruto asks Mitsuki if he found what he's looking for. Mitsuki explains what \u014cnoki told him, that he's seen many things since leaving the village, and that while he's not sure if he's empty, he is sure of his will. Boruto says he and Sarada want to know the real him, and gives him back his forehead protector. Mitsuki wants to lure K\u016b away while they take \u014cnoki away, as there are clones of him, but Boruto says the one in front of him is Mitsuki. K\u016b arrives at their location. Boruto distracts him with shadow clones. K\u016b takes control of the debris, using it to destroy Boruto's clones. Sarada destroys a boulder coming at Boruto. The genin struggle against K\u016b, while \u014cnoki despairs at young lives being at risk again. Sarada uses her Sharingan to dodge K\u016b's boulders, and he prepares a Dust Release attack. Sarada and Mitsuki attack it with their own ninjutsu, using its explosion as a smokescreen to get to him, holding his arms apart so he can't weave hand seals. He throws them aside as Boruto throws himself at K\u016b, who punches him with a rock gauntlet, revealing it as a shadow clone, the real Boruto coming after him, and landing a Rasengan on K\u016b's heart. A weakened K\u016b prepares a giant Dust Release to finish them off, but \u014cnoki counters it with one of his own. \u014cnoki admits he allowed his commitment to Kozuchi's will to be twisted, and that he must set it right, his Dust Release overpowering K\u016b's, killing him and taking a substantial part of the building with it. Sekki finds them. \u014cnoki gives them his final words and passes away. Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi arrive with Naruto and other Konoha shinobi by sunset. Konohamaru says he'll give his report to Naruto, and hugs Mitsuki. Mitsuki apologises for giving them so much trouble, thinking he won't be allowed back in the village, but Teams 5 and 15 arrive, all glad Mitsuki is ok.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "92", "Episode Title": "A_New_Ordinary", "Japanese Airdate": "3 February 2019", "episode synopsis text": "The Konoha genin take the Thunder Train back to Konohagakure, while Naruto stays in Iwagakure longer to attend \u014cnoki's funeral.

They ask about Mitsuki, and are told he's still being debriefed, as there's a lot of intel only he knows. Naruto has them leave their forehead protectors. Sai and Konohamaru debrief Mitsuki, and ask him why he chose against informing anyone in the village of his plans. Sarada is concerned Mitsuki will be blamed for the situation in Iwagakure and be forced to leave, or that he might chose to leave on his own. Boruto has faith in Mitsuki. While asleep, he is mentally contacted by Garaga, since Mitsuki being back in the village marks the end of their contract. They exchange words and bid each other farewell. Sarada wakes him up, and informs him Mitsuki's debriefing is over. The two look for him. Mitsuki makes small memorials for the Fabrications. Boruto finds him, and Mitsuki apologises for the hurt he's caused. Boruto recalls \u014cnoki's words, and tells Mitsuki there are many sides to his will, and that his questions are a natural part of it. Sarada arrives and they share a laugh. Orochimaru discusses Mitsuki's development with Log, who informs him the body of the scientist responsible for developing the Fabrications has gone missing. They wonder who might be responsible. Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki walk through the village, and hear the official account of the situation of Iwagakure in the news. Boruto thinks he spots a Heart Stone in the river, but cries when he remembers \u014cnoki's teachings.

Karui doesn't quite remember, and gets angry with him for having eaten by himself the snacks she had bought for them to have together. Karui throws him out when he asks her to buy more chips when she goes out to replenish the snacks. Ch\u014dji and Ch\u014dch\u014d run into Boruto, and they explain their situation. Ch\u014dch\u014d spots an advert for a Parent and Child Day eating contest, and wants to enter it with her father, so he can prove to Karui he's a role model for their daughter. At the contest, they also find Sai and Inojin, Rock Lee, Metal Lee, Shikamaru and Shikadai participating as well.

Boruto recognises Sasuke on the street, who asks him about all the family activities. Boruto explains the new holiday, Sasuke asks about Naruto, and Boruto adds he's with Himawari today, before telling Sasuke where Sarada will be, and suggesting he spend time with her. Waiting by a stream, Sasuke thinks back to times he spent with his father, when he mastered the Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. Sarada is surprised to find him. Sasuke explains he just got to the village, that Boruto told him where she'd be, and invites her to go to festivals. Sarada is happy that Sasuke came to the village, but he explains he dropped by because he had business to attend near the village, cutting down her excitement. Watching other parents with their children, Sasuke struggles to bond with Sarada. The two spot Naruto carrying Himawari as they search for a Kurama doll, Sarada envious of their bond. He thinks back to how he enjoyed being carried by Itachi, and offers to carry her, but she finds it embarrassing and walks off. Kakashi approaches Sasuke, pointing out all his time alone have dulled his social skills, and suggests Sasuke take hints from the Icha Icha books. Sasuke comes across Shino dotting on his Kurama doll, and after an awkward silence, he asks about Sarada. Shino comments on her talent and the difficult path she has chosen. Sasuke asks about any parasites on her, which Shino misunderstands as a negative comment on insects. When he talks to Sarada again, he tries using Kakashi's advice from the books, but ends up further antagonising her. Boruto finds Sarada training by herself, and asks her about Sasuke. She confesses she doesn't think her father knows her at all, but Boruto surprises her asking if she knows Sasuke at all, and that she should tell him if there's something she wants to do. Sasuke complains to Kakashi about his advice, and the two come across Sakura. At home, the two talk about how Sarada perceives Sasuke, and Sakura explains Sarada wants to be Hokage.

Taking notice, her team-mates cover their ears, and Namida cries out, knocking out all their enemies, and the merchants they're supposed to protect. The three praise her jutsu, but Namida gets flustered. In the Information & Receiving Centre, Wasabi and Sumire inform Namida the doctors have cleared them, and Team 7 congratulate them for defeating the Garakuta Gang. When Wasabi and Sumire don't respond, Namida explains they lost their hearing because of her jutsu. Mitsuki points out that if this keeps happening, Namida might get her team-mates killed, prompting her to decide training with new jutsu. Namida practices Water Release, surprising her team-mates, but her jutsu lacks the power to even damage the target. Sumire suggests reevaluating using her Calling on Tears Technique, but Namida insists on using new jutsu and asks Hanabi for help. Hanabi considers chakra control to be the issue and has Sumire use her own Water Release, which does destroy the target. Hanabi explains that when her emotions take over and she begins to cry, that disrupts her focus. She asks Hanabi to teach her. Hanabi has Namida try to mould her chakra while dodging her attacks, using her Byakugan to evaluate her chakra control, but Namida is unable to do it. Next, she has Namida try increasing the distance of her attack, Wasabi and Sumire slightly scared of Hanabi. Hanabi explains how she can modify her jutsu and her Water Release's reach increases. Next, Hanabi wants Namida to knock over a thick log, to train the power behind her jutsu. Sumire and Wasabi decide to train harder as well in solidarity to Namida. The next day, Namida spars against them and continues to improve. Their next mission is once again to guard the same merchants, who are now in possession of a historical document by the First Hokage.

Namida is frustrated that her Water Release was useless against them. One of the merchants reveals they still have the First Hokage's document, but the Garakuta leader reveals himself, glad to have stuck around. Sumire wants to the other two to run away with the merchants, but Namida intercepts a shuriken meant for her. The Garakuta leader sinks them into the ground with an Earth Release. Namida blames herself for their situation, but her team-mates point out she has gotten stronger. The gang leader takes the document and considers it lucky Namida didn't cry. Namida decides to cry, so the gang leader runs away. Wasabi encourages her to cry, and remembering the focus of her training, she applies it to her Calling on Tears Technique, increasing its power and reach, and narrowing its focus, managing to hit the Garakuta leader. Free from his jutsu, Sumire summons Nue, whose disappearance alerts Hanabi of their fight. Wasabi and Nue attack the remnants of the gang, who try to flee. Namida tries using her jutsu again, but having spent so much chakra, she's unable to focus it again, knocking everyone out. Hanabi thinks Namida still has ways to go.

He explains the birds infected with the cursed seal have red eyes even before getting violent. They ask Tosaka about the cursed seal, and he says that because the species is very territorial, finding out where they come from should give them a hint.

Mitsuki informs them Sumire is awake. Sumire tells them of the twins with cursed seals wearing collars, who Boruto remembers as part of the Land of Rivers research them. Sumire speculates they're doing something they don't want discovered. Suigetsu believes they're after J\u016bgo's cursed seal. Karin decides everyone should collaborate, lest unfavourable reports are made to Konoha, that would eventually reach Orochimaru due to their involvement. Sarada and Karin will lure the twins away, so the others can go in and rescue everyone else. Momo and Sasami boast about their cursed seals to a restrained Wasabi and Namida. The research leader tells them to clean up their mess, and sends them after Sumire. They spot her, actually a transformed Sarada. Sumire will look for her team-mates, Mitsuki will look for Konohamaru, Boruto and Suigetsu will look for J\u016bgo. Sasami finds Sumire's movements suspicious. Boruto and Suigetsu run into Tosaka, Sumire finds the girls, who inform her the serum on the desk will remove their cursed seals. Boruto updates Tosaka and asks where J\u016bgo is. The Land of Rivers research leader tries to assassinate Konohamaru, but Mitsuki got to him in time. Sarada drops her disguise and is joined by Karin, but only Sasami reaches them.

He explains the mission was a lie from the start, as he had no choice but to join them, the men he had sent before being captured at the border. Tosaka is glad to have been able to observe J\u016bgo up close, his goal being acquiring J\u016bgo's cursed seal. Boruto admonishes Tosaka for treating J\u016bgo like a research subject, who in turn retorts Boruto himself stressed to importance of dreams, his being creating the ultimate cursed seal weapon. Suigetsu covertly turns his arm into water while Tosaka is distracted. Tosaka explains he had to bait J\u016bgo out, so he infected the birds. Suigetsu attempts to free J\u016bgo, but is tasered by other Land of Rivers researchers before succeeding. The head researcher announces preparations to leave with J\u016bgo. As a demonstration for Boruto, Tosaka injects J\u016bgo with a special drug. Sumire baits Momo with a water clone and attacks him from a distance. Momo points out she left her friends vulnerable, and striking the ground, sends a lot of debris their way. Sumire protects them with a water wall, but a few rocks go through it. Momo criticises her split focus, and tells her to use her summon. Sumire summons Nue, but it's still small due to her depleted chakra. Sarada warns Karin that Sasami's bite will infect her with a cursed seal, and tracks Sasami's movements with her Sharingan. Sumire protects Nue from Momo, distracting him long enough for Namida to hit him with her improved Calling on Tears Technique. Wasabi joins in the attack with her Cat Covering, exciting Momo with the prospect of a more interesting fight. Sarada struggles with depleting chakra, but Karin is able to lock on Sasami's chakra, showing them where Sasami will attack from. Sasami still knocks Sarada out, but Karin uses her chakra chains to restrain her. Karin wants Sarada to bite her for healing, reasoning that her chains won't hold forever, wanting Sarada to still be able to fight. Karin reveals that long ago Sakura saved her life, and uses Sarada's reaction to it to make her bite her arm, asking Sarada to tell Sakura she has repaid her debt. Karin informs Sarada where Sasami will attack from, allowing Sarada to land a full hit on her, defeating her and destroying her cursed seal collar. J\u016bgo slowly transforms, and Tosaka explains the drug he used is meant to trigger his transformation, as he wants to witness his full power, despite Boruto's warning that not even he will be safe. Mitsuki reports to Konohamaru, who decides against regrouping, and instead wants to go to the alleged researchers' boat downriver, where he believes they can find something to stop the infection. Momo defeats Namida and Wasabi, so Sumire distracts him with a water clone again to get them to safety. Despite Sumire's reservations, she agrees to let Namida and Wasabi have their chakra drained by Nue, so it can grow big again, strong enough to defeat Momo. A restored Nue goes up against Momo, with an assist from Sumire. They're able to defeat Momo and break his cursed seal collar. Sumire has to stop Nue from draining Momo's chakra. The other researchers check in on Tosaka, and attempt to kill J\u016bgo to prevent his transformation. Tosaka kills them instead with his cursed seal. On their way to the village, Sarada notices dawn is approaching, and changes course, concerned the wild geese will start to migrate, spreading the infection. Boruto can move again and begins to free J\u016bgo. Tosaka attempts to stop him, but is stopped by Suigetsu's enlarged arm. Commenting on his jutsu, Tosaka tasers Suigetsu again.

Sarada informs Karin the infected birds have red eyes, and the two begin trying to isolate them. Team 15 arrives by the lake, and Sarada requests their help. Boruto tries following J\u016bgo, but is still feeling the effects of the tranquilliser, so Tosaka overtakes him in the pursuit. J\u016bgo arrives at the lake shore, followed by Tosaka, who is ecstatic at the prospect of the birds spreading the cursed seal, which would give him more samples to study. Boruto arrives with shadow clones, attacking Tosaka with explosive tag kunai, but he shrugs them off, fully transforming, and capturing Boruto and his clones with extra arms and a tail. Tosaka begins losing his patience waiting for J\u016bgo to fight him, and dismisses Boruto's concerns about J\u016bgo. J\u016bgo fully transforms, makes short work of Tosaka, and absorbs his cursed seal before tossing him aside. Karin, Sarada, and Team 15 struggle to find all the infected birds, and Karin says they should consider just killing all the birds. J\u016bgo continues to rampage and attacks Boruto. Suigetsu drags himself to the lake, still weak from the tranquilliser and taser shocks, complaining that J\u016bgo should rampage closer by. Tosaka tells Boruto J\u016bgo will probably rampage until he dies. Nue saves Boruto from J\u016bgo's attack, and keeps on attacking him, against Sumire's orders. She tries to intervene, but Boruto warns her she'll get caught up in the attacks, and that they have to find a different way. Tosaka continues to muse of genetically determined fates, but Boruto ignores him. Karin is concerned Sarada can't bring herself to cull the birds, but Sarada says she should be the one to do it, as the mission was assigned to her team. Boruto tells Sumire that Konohamaru managed to revert J\u016bgo's transformation by inflicting significant damage with his Rasengan, and that he doesn't think he can make one strong enough to cause such damage. Boruto notices the speed J\u016bgo is charging at in his attacks, and speculates that if he comes at him at that speed, he might damage him enough to revert the transformation. J\u016bgo tosses Nue aside, and Boruto draws his attention. Boruto builds up speed using one Boruto Stream on top of another, and lands a Rasengan, but J\u016bgo's transformation doesn't revert. The domesticated goose flies by at the last second, and J\u016bgo's transformation recedes. Tosaka passes out considering it ridiculous. The sun comes up, and Sarada prepares to kill the birds. Mitsuki stops her, and Konohamaru arrives with Suigetsu, showing her the serum to neutralise the cursed seal they stole from the enemy's base. Suigetsu consumes the serum, merges with the lake's water, and rains it down on the birds, curing them. The domesticated goose struggles and manages to fly with the wild ones. Sumire makes a decision, and informs Namida and Wasabi she intends to join the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team to find a better way to synergise with Nue through science, and asks them not to tell the others yet, wanting to do it herself. Konohamaru considers the mission a success, but is exasperated when Mitsuki informs him Karin and Suigetsu took Tosaka with them when they left. Suigetsu teases Karin about feeling maternal towards Sarada. Sarada tells Boruto he was reckless, and Boruto retorts it worked.

Sarada's building doesn't allow pets, and Boruto has to ask his mother permission, so Mitsuki ends up responsible for the kitten. On his way home, a passerby tells Mitsuki should hold it in a gentler manner. Sarada and Boruto discuss whether Mitsuki will know how to take care of it, Sarada wishing Boruto had taken it. He says he might convince their parents if Himawari supports him. At Mitsuki's home, the kitten quickly gets stuck in the window blind strings, and knocks a portrait down. It insists on sleeping with Mitsuki on his bed until he relents. The next day, K\u014dtar\u014d informs Konohamaru none of the men they apprehended had the stolen jewel, so they can't hold any of them. K\u014dtar\u014d orders two other cops to keep an eye of them.

The veterinarian, who is the same men who advised Mitsuki how to hold Mikazuki, informs him the kitten will be fine. At the park, Mikazuki's parent shows up, and the two leave together. Boruto and Sarada ask if Mitsuki is fine, but he says he doesn't feel anything, and that Mikazuki will be happier with its parent.

Shikamaru asks her if she's using Asuma's chakra blades, which she confirms, but adds she can't use them like Shikamaru does. Shikamaru points out she shares Asuma's chakra nature, so she shouldn't have difficulty mastering the blades. Mirai offers Shikamaru an answer to a quiz he made her, but it's a wrong one, and Shikamaru points out she's overthinking it. After the Nara leave, Mirai tells Boruto of her mission. Arriving at the gates, Mirai is disappointed by the casual and leisurely attitudes of Kakashi and Guy. They point out she's supposed to blend in as civilian. Mirai mistakes their casual conversation as an advanced form of blending in, and continues working herself up, even mistaking an old man on the road for a potential enemy. They arrive at their destination, and go on several shops. A pickpocket tries to steal Kakashi's wallet, but Kakashi immobilises him. The pickpocket throws the wallet to his partner, who Mirai chases and stops with her genjutsu. She hands the pickpockets over to the police. Mirai is upset for letting the pickpockets getting so close, and that Kakashi was so carefree. Kakashi points out the wallet he allowed to be stolen was a fake, and that there are other ways of dealing with problems than power.

Curious about their reaction, Mirai asks them what the books are about, but they refuse to say anything due to her age. They take a photo to remember the occasion. They talk about the vacation, and when Mirai asks about the mission, she learns there's no actual mission, much to her shock. At night in a hotel, Mirai watches from afar as Guy and Kakashi have dinner. Kakashi notices her, and invites her in. She insists on taking her mission seriously, even when he suggests her soaking in the hot springs, and he reveals her awkward attitude reminds him of Asuma.

Noticing the people wearing dog and cat masks, Kakashi recalls what the festival is about, and explains to Mirai the town's origins, and how different people celebrate different dog and cat deities, depending on which version of the town's origins they believe, and about a third destruction deity, neither cat nor dog. Cat lovers and dog lovers from various lands come to the festival, culminating in a shrine fight.

Mirai wonders if they should try to reconcile them, but Kakashi and Guy point out their matter is a private one. They figure that being able to stay in the town depends on making peace between the dog lovers and cat lovers, making the issue part of the mission.

He considers the currently peaceful era to be a waste, which mirrors Mirai's concerns that the challenges they face won't allow them to surpass the previous generation. Ry\u016bki seemingly slashes Mirai, acquiring her blood, and controlling her. Damaging the puppet, Ry\u016bki appears to use her blood to acquire immortality, but everything fades as Mirai reveals her genjutsu. Ry\u016bki is confused as he tasted her blood, but Mirai reveals it was just the iron-rich water from hot springs. Ry\u016bki is convinced what he sees now is a genjutsu, and charges at her. Guy and Kakashi watch as Mirai strikes back at him, seeing Asuma in her as she defeats Ry\u016bki. He and his cultists are apprehended, and Mirai explains what happened to Tatsumi. They talk about having memories of their loved ones and looking to the future. Kakashi and Guy exchange words and discuss Mirai's growth. They part ways with Tatsumi and go back to Konohagakure. Mirai is sceptical that they came across such an operation by accident, and they explain their mission was to investigate the missing girls, while Mirai's was to protect them, Kiba, Ch\u014dji, and Tenten having been sent to gather intel while acting as tourists. As they arrive, Mirai realises they've been giving her all the details so she can write the mission report. Boruto greets her as she arrives, and is shocked when she tells him what happened. Later, Mirai plays sh\u014dgi with Shikamaru, and says she figured out the \"king\" is the future generations.

Shikamaru stresses that ch\u016bnin are team leaders, and should be chosen based on their ability to discern battle situations and make decisions. Naruto and Shikamaru review the sections of the exams and those who passed them, discarding them as they analyse how they fought and strategised their battles. They eventually narrow it down to Sarada, Sumire, and Denki, and Naruto decides to promote Sarada, as while she's on par with Denki and Sumire in terms of strategy, he finds her to have the better fighting skills among them. Sasuke arrives, feeling the need to report in. He says he hasn't been able to find Urashiki, but has discovered evidence that Urashiki had been around in several locations before Momoshiki and Kinshiki arrived, and Shikamaru speculates he was gathering intel. Seeing Sarada's photo, he deduces Naruto wants to promote her, but having learned from Sarada's desertion after the exams from Sakura, voices his concerns over who should be promoted.

Moegi arrives to give him his first mission as team captain. She claims the mission is easy, but Shikadai is suspicious of her coming all the way to his house to tell him if that was the case. Because the mission was sudden, they had to put together a team with the available genin. Shikadai meets with Iwabee and Wasabi at the gates, who begin arguing with each other. Boruto arrives late, and offers him condolences for his team. Their mission is to retrieve a flower that grows at the top of a mountain. The genin question the mission, and Shikadai explains it's a rare flower that blooms only once every four years, and due to its medicinal properties, is sold at high prices, so they should also be on the look out for bandits. Wasabi asks how they'll find the flower, and Shikadai presents them Tonsuke, a pig with a great sense of smell that'll act as their guide, much to their shock. Because he's the only pig who can find the flower, he's been spoiled rotten, and has to be fed special food regularly. Because one of the pigs who was being trained was stolen, they need to carry the pig as extra security, a task that falls to Iwabee. At night, they come across wolves. Wasabi scares them away, but also scares Tonsuke, who flees. Shikadai retrieves him, noticing his snout-shaped birth mark. Boruto attempts to reassure Shikadai while Iwabee and Wasabi argue over whether they should cross a bridge or go to a detour. Shikadai decides they should cross the bridge, but when Wasabi and Iwabee begin arguing again, the bridge starts swaying, and it scares Tonsuke, who almost falls, if not for Boruto and Shikadai. Shikadai forbids Iwabee and Wasabi from talking to each other for the rest of the mission. They come across bandits, and Iwabee and Wasabi both charge. Boruto warns Shikadai about a trap, but Shikadai injures his leg, and Tonsuke escapes. The bandits are defeated, and Boruto recovers Tonsuke. Shikadai decides to finish the mission by himself. Tonsuke suddenly starts eating forest mushrooms, much to Shikadai and Boruto's surprise. Shikadai notices the lack of the birth mark, and deduces the pig was switched with the stolen one during the skirmish with the bandits. They find the bandits, but can't give chase because of Shikadai's leg injury. Wasabi and Iwabee discuss Shikadai's decision, and Iwabee spots Shikadai's blood on the trap. Boruto attempts to make bridge with his shadow clones to cross a ravine, but the gap is too big. Shikadai wants to jump the ravine even with his injury, but Iwabee arrives and uses his Earth Release to make a bridge. He and Wasabi apologise for fighting. Boruto wonders how to find Tonsuke, and Shikadai says Tonsuke will signal them. As he hasn't been fed in a while, Tonsuke starts crying, allowing Wasabi to pinpoint him with her cat hearing. They're able to ambush most of the bandits with Boruto and his shadow clones. Shikadai lures Tonsuke with his food, allowing Iwabee to separate him from the bandit leader with Earth Release, and pins the bandit leader with his shadow. They find the flower and succeed on their mission.

While comparing new cards, the boys run into Shino, who gets uncomfortable learning Kiba and Akamaru are featured in the cards while he isn't. The three know how strong Shino is, and Boruto wants to make him a card, pointing out the Kaminarimon Company manufactures them. They manage to get an audience with Denki's father, who shows them a list of the next card series, which still has an open spot. Denki's father has such respect for shinobi he's having a hard time picking a final one. They advocate for Shino's inclusion, but Metal Lee ends up suggesting his own father, also not present in the list. Denki's father can't make up his mind, so Denki suggests they pick the one who'll make a bigger profit. The company will make a survey and let the customers decide who'll get the final spot. Boruto and Shikadai campaign for Shino with shadow clones and distributing leaflets, and Metal and Denki, who Rock Lee once trained, put advertisements on the trains. Checking on the current tally, Rock Lee is leading the votes, so to raise Shino's profile, Boruto has Iwabee make a Shino stone face near the Hokage Rock with his Earth Release in exchange for one of the super rare Seventh Hokage duplicate cards Boruto has. Metal uses taijutsu to try carving Shino's face into his father's. Boruto creates shadow clones to use Wind Release: Gale Palm to carve Shino's face back. Shikadai thinks it'll all end in trouble and leaves. Boruto and Metal end up carving the giant stone face into a small statue, and are stopped by Shino and Rock Lee.

When the second series is released, Boruto calls Shikadai out for just abandoning their efforts. When they open their packs, there are both Rock Lee and Shino cards.

The woman is astonished by the view while Konohamaru carries her jumping between buildings, and thanks him when they land. She introduces herself as Remon Yoimura. Boruto asks her why she was being chased. She claims she came to Konoha for sightseeing, ran into them when getting lost, and thinks she upset them.

Remon had never eaten a burger before, but loves sour foods. She enjoys it so much she decide to live in Konohagakure. At their suggestion, Konohamaru tries the burger, but doesn't like the sourness.

Boruto asks Konohamaru about the situation, but he says nothing. On their way home, they find a girl from Remon's village who cannot remember her way home, so Konohamaru insists on taking her to the village. Kankitsu questions Remon about her attitude, telling her not to worry about the handkerchief, offering to buy her everything. Remon wants to retreat to her room, but Kankitsu has her confined to a new, secure building. Remon feels like a prisoner, but seeing how sad other villagers are about it, and Kankitsu reminding her it's for the good of the village, she relents.

At Konohamaru's request, she tells the legend of her village. Four centuries prior, Daidai Village was almost destroyed by S\u014dma, a demon who consumes memories, leading them to waste away. She draws them a picture, a horned skull spirit. At the time, a shrine maiden, Kuen, battled S\u014dma, who came close to possessing her, but she managed to seal it in a rock. However, a portion of S\u014dma stayed within her, resulting in a curse that was passed down to her descendants. When bearers of the curse reach age twenty, the curse manifests a mark on their hands, signalling they connect S\u014dma with the outside world, and they slowly have their memories drained. Remon explains that she and Kankitsu are both descendants of Kuen through different branch families, and that every hundred years, the seal restricting S\u014dma weakens. Boruto notices Remon is not losing her memories, and she explains that her hairclip is a tool created by Kuen that protects against S\u014dma's power, given to the female descendants who inherit the curse. When S\u014dma gets stronger, its horns begin growing from the rock, signalling it is time for the seal to be repaired. At that time, a man and woman who bear the curse are wed and reapply the seal. Boruto questions why can't the seal be applied without them being married. Remon explains Kankitsu is losing his memories, and the only way to break the curse is through marriage. Boruto says they'll defeat S\u014dma, but she explains it doesn't have a physical form, so it can't be attacked with weapons or ninjutsu. Konohamaru confirms the existence of such beings, evidenced by the one his grandfather made a contract with. Kankitsu leaves at night, and the old woman wonders where he goes. Remon says Kankitsu wasn't this cold when they were younger, but Boruto is still against her marrying someone who will not make her happy. She explains that the story of Konohamaru's grandfather gave her strength to go through with it. He returns her handkerchief, then leaves. As Boruto argues against leaving Remon in this situation, they're approached by the old woman, Asaki of the Yoimura family. She confirms Kankitsu's change in personality, and asks them to confirm where he goes at night. He visits Remon, finds she has her handkerchief back, and stays put for the night.

Kankitsu surmises he has to do more than erase her memories, and moves in to finish her. Boruto forces his retreat with thrown kunai. He refuses to explain his intentions, adding Boruto would only forget them anyway, and produces several will-o'-the-wisps that follow Boruto around.

Shinki begins fighting Urashiki's remaining puppet. It manages to hit Shinki with poisoned needles. Shinki feigns a hit from a sword with a clone, while the real Shinki anchors the puppet to the ground with Iron Sand and continues on his way, his arm paralysed. Shukaku teases him slightly that he might have been able to avenge his uncle if Boruto had been there to aid him in the fight. They arrive at a crevice, and Urashiki's puppet catches up to them, but so does Boruto, who lands a hit on it. Temari and Shikadai also arrive, giving Boruto and Shinki an opportunity to retreat. Boruto apologises for dismissing Shinki's feelings, but adds his friends are important as well. Shinki berates Boruto for being emotional, and Shukaku laughs, comparing Boruto to Naruto. Boruto goes back to help Temari and Shikadai, and Shukaku sneaks away from Shinki after Boruto as well. The puppet releases poison gas, but Temari blows it away, throwing the puppet into the crevice. Boruto arrives, and the puppet climbs back up. Shinki berates Shukaku for watching the battle, and Shukaku points out they do have to deal with pursuers. The three go against the puppet, and while Shinki thinks their fighting is inefficient because of their emotions, Shukaku points out they're able to coordinate just fine, and adds that while he did compare Boruto to Naruto, Shukaku considers Boruto smarter and more skilled than Naruto was. Shinki takes Shukaku and continues to move away from the battle. The puppet pressures the shinobi with multiple arms, chakra blasts, and attacking after burrowing itself under the sand. Temari unearths the puppet with her Wind Release, but it's able to dodge her attacks in the air, sending attacks of its own. Temari gets injured protecting Shikadai from an attack. Temari tells them she'll buy them time to leave, but they refuse. Boruto creates clones to form a perimeter and manages to land an explosive kunai on the puppet without detonating it, allowing Shikadai to uses Temari's fan to unearth the puppet again. In dodging Boruto's Rasengan, the puppet is caught by Shikadai's shadow, allowing Boruto to land his Rasengan, which along with the explosive kunai detonation is enough to destroy the puppet. Temari tells Boruto to catch up to Shinki, while she and Shikadai recover and look for Kankur\u014d. Urashiki catches up to Temari and Shikadai, having watched them fight through the puppets, and steals both their chakra. He muses it'll be bad if Shukaku reaches Konoha, but he does want to enjoy himself. Boruto catches up to Shinki and Shukaku, updating them on the puppet's defeat.

Urashiki intercepts them. Shinki is incredulous that Urashiki broke through Gaara's seal, and wonders how he tracked Shukaku when the kettle should suppress their chakra. Urashiki explains he watched them through the puppets, and reveals his Byakugan. He is pleased with taking Temari and Shikadai's chakra, which riles Boruto. Shinki stresses they have to keep a cool head, as neither Sasuke nor Gaara are there. Shukaku asks Shinki to unseal him, so he can fight. Shinki has a plan, and asks Boruto to buy him time. Urashiki attacks. Shinki blocks with his Iron Sand, and Boruto counterattacks with shadow clones. Boruto feints an attack disguised as a kunai, which Urashiki also avoids. Boruto signals to Shinki, who attempts to seal him with his puppet and Iron Sand. Urashiki is bored by yet another seal. They flee, and Shinki leaves several Third Eyes behind to keep track of Urashiki, certain that his seal won't hold as long as Gaara's. Boruto is concerned about the Byakugan, and Shinki changes their direction. Urashiki breaks free and resumes pursuit. Having put enough distance between them, Urashiki continues on the shortest route to the Land of Fire, unaware the genin and Shukaku have changed course. They can't rush to the Land of Fire, afraid they'll get in range of Urashiki's Byakugan, so Boruto suggests vising Goj\u014d, who has a transmitter. Shinki struggles, having spent a lot of chakra with his Puppet Technique and Third Eyes. Boruto helps him. They arrive at Goj\u014d's house, but it's been attacked. Isago tries to get her father from under the debris. Shinki is more concerned with knowing if Urashiki is the one who attacked them than with helping Goj\u014d, earning Boruto's censure. Shinki rescues him. Goj\u014d informs them who attacked them, confirming it was Urashiki looking for them. Their transmitter has been destroyed, so they can't ask for backup. Looking at a map, Shinki sees only one way to the Land of Fire, through a bridge, where Urashiki is sure to be on the lookout for them. Goj\u014d says there's a longer path known only to locals, but Shinki is sure Urashiki will find it if he stays waiting long enough. Boruto suggests using both routes, one of them carrying a decoy kettle on the route Urashiki is watching, buying time for the other one to use the long route with Shukaku. As Boruto can do shadow clones for decoys, he think the logical decision is for him to be bait for Urashiki. At the bridge, Urashiki attacks Boruto, causing debris to fall into the river. At the longer route, Shinki notices the debris, and Shukaku talks to him about regret. In another dimension, Sasuke's chakra begins to replenish, enough for him to try getting back.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "125", "Episode Title": "Boruto_and_Shinki", "Japanese Airdate": "22 September 2019", "episode synopsis text": "Shinki continues towards the Land of Fire, while Shukaku wonders how Boruto is doing. Boruto attempts to hide from Urashiki to buy Shinki time, but Urashiki finds him with his Byakugan. Shinki arrives at the Land of Fire border, but is stopped by Mirai, who recognises him as Gaara's son. He doesn't attack, but stresses the urgency of his mission to speak with the Hokage. He can't share the details with anyone lower than ch\u016bnin, so Sai offers to hear him, having been sent to investigate Sasuke's lack of communication. Shinki informs him of the situation. Sai orders border patrol to be on high alert, Mirai and Shinki to stand by, while he takes Shukaku to Naruto. Urashiki attacks Boruto, destroying the clone disguised as Shinki. Using Shikadai's chakra, he pins Boruto with his shadow, and discovers the kettle with him is a decoy. Urashiki intends to use Boruto as a hostage and trade him for Shukaku. Boruto manages to land a superficial hit with a clone. Urashiki attempts to steal Boruto's chakra, but is blocked by Shinki's Iron Sand. Shinki tells Boruto he's guaranteed Shukaku's safety, and proceeds to attempt crushing Urashiki. Urashiki breaks free of the Iron Sand, switches to the Rinnegan, and attacks. Boruto sends a Lightning Release shuriken, which Urashiki blocks, but the charge goes through his fishing rod just the same. He evades their attacks by teleporting. Boruto's eye activates, which Urashiki recognises. He uses Temari's chakra as a distraction to attack Shinki, but Boruto's eye allows him to detect where Urashiki's portal will appear. Using clones as bait for Urashiki to destroy, they manage to corner him and land attacks, managing to break one of his horns. Urashiki strikes to kill, but his attack is blocked by Sasuke, who was able to track Urashiki through his constant use of Space-Time Ninjutsu through the fight. Sasuke attacks, but changing his eyes again, Urashiki disappears, but not through a portal, leaving behind crane origami of the same red energy that comprises his fishing rod and hook, which disappear shortly after. Sasuke is out of chakra, unable to pursue him, and Boruto and Shinki pass out from exhaustion. Gaara wakes up in a Sunagakure hospital, to Yodo and Araya's relief. Kankur\u014d is battered up, but alive. A search party finds Temari and Shikadai, and informs them of Kankur\u014d's status. Naruto is informed of the situation by Shukaku, wanting to leave immediately, but Sasuke arrives and stays his hand. Three days later, Naruto discusses the issue with Gaara, who wants to warn the other Kage. Shikadai informs Boruto that Shinki has been discharged, and Boruto rushes to the train station to say good bye. Shinki asks Gaara what he meant before, as he feels he has learned nothing from Boruto. Boruto arrives, and reprimands Shinki for not saying good bye to his friend.

They're concerned about the other tailed beasts, now that they know Urashiki wants to collect massive quantities of chakra. They wish to convene a Five Kage Summit. Shukaku complains about their situation, and Naruto explains they'll stay with him. Shukaku only agrees because Gaara asked them, feeling uncomfortable with sharing a roof with Kurama. Kurama and Shukaku exchange insults. Naruto arrives home with Shukaku, explaining they'll stay with them until an official safehouse is picked. Boruto and Shukaku greet each other, and Himawari is instantly taken by how cute she finds Shukaku. Boruto asks Naruto and Shukaku about the tailed beasts. Naruto gives them a brief history of tailed beasts and jinch\u016briki. He later meets with the tailed beasts in their mental plane, though Matatabi, Koku\u014d, and Ch\u014dmei decided not to participate. They talk about their protection, and the others comment on Shukaku's absence in the meeting, which Kurama teasingly attributes to their current situation. While tucking Himawari in, Naruto and Kurama recall how she knocked them both out when she awakened her Byakugan. Shukaku overhears it and becomes intrigued. The next day, they all leave together, Shukaku eager to learn how she knocked Kurama out so they can tease Kurama about it. They spend the day together, and ultimate end up at the Senju park, where Naruto takes a nap. Shukaku sees nothing unusual about Himawari, so they ask her aside and questions her about it. She doesn't remember any of it, and Shukaku disregards her. Shukaku falls asleep, and their kettle is picked up, being mistaken for trash. Boruto and Himawari ask a park employee, who explains the trash was taken to a scrap yard. As they watch a trash compactor, Himawari blames herself for not watching Shukaku closely. The stress of the situation triggers her Byakugan, allowing her to find Shukaku's kettle. Shukaku awakes from the ruckus, and sees Himawari with the Byakugan. When it deactivates, she has no memory of it. Boruto breaks their fall. At night, Shukaku and Kurama actually bond over how the Uzumaki's drive them crazy, and are never boring. Shukaku figures Kurama actually likes them. The next day, Naruto takes Shukaku away, who waves Himawari and Boruto goodbye with their tail. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss the tailed beasts' safehouses, and Shikamaru muses at how Shukaku sleeps so carefree, and how he doesn't understand tailed beasts at all.

He asks about the tailed beasts the Hokage hid, but she defiantly says she wouldn't tell even if she knew. He takes her chakra, noting the potential usefulness of genjutsu. Someone tries to contact Mirai through her earpiece radio, which sparks Urashiki's curiosity and gives him an idea. Several shinobi patrol the streets in Konoha. Naruto feels this makes the villagers uneasy, but Shikamaru stresses they can't be too careful, as Urashiki has attacked many shinobi and can teleport. Naruto is concerned Sasuke isn't in top form since having his chakra stolen, and wishes Urashiki would come at him directly. Urashiki muses his actions have drawn too much attention, and decides to use all the chakra he gathered so far, hoping that getting Kurama will even it out. Shikamaru informs Naruto the other villages are cooperating, and that Mirai has gone missing. Naruto wants to send a clone to look for Urashiki, but Shikamaru and Sasuke counsel him against it. Boruto arrives, and asks why he was left out when all other genin were tasked with finding Urashiki. Naruto says it's too risky to send him out, as Urashiki has a vendetta against him, saying even he was more reasonable at that age. Sasuke suggests forming a two-man team with Boruto, as this should prevent Urashiki from easily going after Boruto, but Naruto restricts their movements to the village, as Sasuke needs to stay nearby in case Urashiki attacks Konoha. Boruto spots his friends, and Denki explains they're helping test new radio technology from the Kaminarimon Company. From Denki and Haguruma's mission control, they hear as Urashiki is found moving away from the village. Tenten relays orders through the radio. While several shinobi mobilise to corner Urashiki, Sasuke explains to Boruto that Urashiki is likely to have stolen Mirai's chakra, and using it to draw shinobi away from the village with genjutsu. The Konoha shinobi are able to prevent K\u014drogi and Mirai from attacking each other, each seeing the other as Urashiki because of genjutsu. Urashiki had used Mirai's radio to gain intel on their movements, and prepares to go after Naruto. Boruto and Sasuke rush to the Hokage's office, but Boruto stops. Knowing that Naruto still has capable shinobi near him, he deduces Urashiki is after something else, and recalls that the artefact that has been on the news has the same symbol they saw in the \u014ctsutsuki ruin where they fought the White Zetsu. They go to the research facility instead, and find shinobi drained of their chakra. Urashiki activates the artefact, Karasuki, a turtle-like device. Boruto and Sasuke arrive, and attempt to stop Urashiki from using it. Urashiki steps into the light created by the device, Boruto and Sasuke follow him into it, arriving at an unusual dimension. Boruto and Sasuke attack Urashiki, but he repels them, knocking Boruto into Karasuki, and causing them to fall off a ledge. Sasuke uses his Rinnegan to switch them with Urashiki, and shields them all with Susanoo. They land on a forest, and make their way back to Konoha.

Karasuki also warns them about changing the future by interfering with the past. Sasuke and Boruto change into less conspicuous clothes. Boruto is surprised there is no Lightning Burger, and that Ramen Ichiraku is a small establishment.

He throws them off by giving Boruto his binoculars, but he and Naruto are caught and beaten up by Tsunade, and made to apologise. She asks Sasuke and Boruto who they are what they're doing in Konoha, and Sasuke claims they're travelling performs who use basic ninjutsu in their tricks. Tsunade explains they'll have to be watched, as a genin has recently deserted the village, requiring security to be increased. She tasks Naruto and Jiraiya to keep a watch on them.

Konohamaru arrives, wanting to show Naruto the progress of his Sexy Technique. Naruto is unimpressed and shows his Sexy Technique instead, and mentions Boruto's is also better than Konohamaru's. Before Boruto can show it, Sakura arrives and punches Naruto over the jutsu, scaring Konohamaru off. Hinata intervenes on Naruto's behalf, and Boruto finds his parents' interactions embarrassing, but becomes interested when Neji arrives. Rock Lee also shows up, and Boruto is startled by how much looks like his son. Neji says Tsunade gave him orders to gather Naruto and all available genin. As Boruto is under his supervision, he has to accompany Naruto to the meeting. Naruto bumps into another shinobi, and Boruto begins talking about Thunder Trains. As they walk away, the shinobi he bumped into, Denki's father, muses on the idea. Boruto asks Naruto about the fact that Tsunade's face isn't on the Hokage Rock.

Sakura and Ino are surprised when Hinata talks to Boruto without a trace of nervousness. When the boys consider investigating what the bathhouse owner would have over Tsunade to make her order them to clean it, Naruto tries to focus on getting the job done, which Shikamaru finds unusual.

Sasuke speculates to himself it's due to the f\u016binjutsu sealing the Nine-Tails. Urashiki opts to restrain Naruto instead, and dodges Sasuke again with his Rinnegan, noting he's not a full power. Jiraiya arrives just in time to witness Urashiki dodging Boruto's Rasengan. Having secured Naruto, Urashiki traps Boruto, Sasuke, and Jiraiya with rocks, and leaves to figure out why he can't extract the Nine-Tails' chakra. Jiraiya asks who Urashiki is, and talking around the fact they're from the future, Sasuke explains that Urashiki is after the Nine-Tails, and they're there to stop him. Sasuke mentions a possible connection between Urashiki and Akatsuki to make his story more believable. Satisfied with the explanation, but still wanting for details, Jiraiya breaks them out of the rock prison with a summoned toad. Urashiki tells Naruto he'll extract the Nine-Tails from him. Boruto explains Urashiki's ability to Jiraiya, who in line with Sasuke's earlier speculation, attributes the failure to the seal keeping the fox in Naruto, and stresses that if Urashiki forcefully breaks the seal, everyone will be in danger and Naruto will die.

However, he doesn't know what kind of Cooperation Ninjutsu they'll end up developing. They try it, but fail, and Jiraiya explains that to do it properly, their chakra nature, power, and flow must be aligned. Since Jiraiya states their chakra nature is already similar, Boruto surmises they need to focus on power and flow, his observation earning praise from Jiraiya. They try it again, but the trauma of being attacked by Naruto when the Nine-Tails' chakra made him rampage hinders Boruto's performance. Jiraiya asks them what they visualise then trying to sync, and based on Boruto's answer, he confirms he knows the Rasengan, much to Naruto's surprise. Boruto realises that if they both try to sync visualising the Rasengan, the power and flow of their chakra will be better aligned.

Boruto and Naruto are surprised. Jiraiya is wary of him, believing Urashiki to still have something up his sleeve. Urashiki consumes his chakra gourd, and considering it not to be enough, eats his own Rinnegan. He manifests a new, golden Rinnegan on his forehead, and transforms, his eyes restored as golden Byakugan. Jiraiya is concerned by the feel of his chakra, and Urashiki claims he'll kill them. Team Ebisu decide to go back and notify the village. Urashiki lunges at the boys, requiring Jiraiya to pull them out of the way. Boruto and Naruto attempt to attack Urashiki, but he dodges them and counterattacks, throwing them at the ground. Jiraiya catches them, and decides to take the lead on the attack. Sasuke wakes up in Sakura's care. Jiraiya sends a Fire Release at Urashiki, who just eats it, leading Jiraiya to speculate he can't use space-time ninjutsu at the moment. He asks the boys to distract Urashiki while he comes up with a way to stop his movements. Jiraiya tries trapping him with his hair, but Urashiki breaks free, and tosses him aside by the hair. When Urashiki comes to the ground, Jiraiya tries sinking him in a swamp, but he breaks out of it as well. Konohamaru struggles to convince anyone that Naruto is in danger, until Shikamaru comes around. Team Asuma, Kiba, Akamaru, and Shino decide to go help Naruto. Sasuke tries to get Sakura to conserve her chakra. She warns him he's still not healed, and wants to ask him something, but passes out before she can do it. Urashiki pins Naruto down with a black receiver, and focuses his attacks on Jiraiya and Boruto. He taunts Naruto, wishing for the Nine-Tails' chakra to overflow. Urashiki attacks Boruto with no regard for his vessel status, but his attack is blocked by Sasuke, who also cuts Naruto free. Jiraiya lands a Rasengan on Urashiki, who finds it amusing. Sasuke sends a Fire Release that barely misses Urashiki. Urashiki attacks with energy blasts as it begins to rain. Sasuke gets in close and attempts to burn him with Amaterasu, but Urashiki dodges it. Sasuke applies it to his blade instead, which Urashiki counters with his black receiver. Naruto struggles to contain the Nine-Tails' chakra. Jiraiya blocks an attack meant for Naruto, causing him to go berserk. Urashiki celebrates the chakra coming out. Naruto creates Rasengan out of the chakra cloak and sends them at Urashiki. Jiraiya is concerned about Naruto dying, and explains to Boruto that the chakra, while powerful, also eats away at him. Boruto rushes to Naruto, Jiraiya figuring he's going for his Rasengan, and tells Sasuke they should save their strength for the right moment. Despite being attacked by Naruto, Boruto is able to reach him, and the two manage to combine their jutsu, their Cooperation Ninjutsu training paying off. While their jutsu clashes with Urashiki's, Jiraiya sneaks in a Rasengan of his own, distracting him, allowing Sasuke to hit him with Kirin, affecting long enough for the boys' jutsu to connect, defeating him. The Nine-Tails' chakra recedes, and both Naruto and Boruto collapse from exhaustion.

Sakura arrives and asks Sasuke about the blurred letter she recovered. Jiraiya lies and says they're fans of his books, the letter actually being a memo with information they gathered about him, and since he has connection to their group, the letter had Sasuke's name, and he knew Sakura's name. A mortified Sasuke goes along with the lie. Sakura leaves, and Naruto arrives, and is told of Boruto and Sasuke's imminent departure. The next day, Karasuki emerges from its shell, ready to work again. Boruto hides it when Naruto arrives to say goodbye. Naruto gives him a farewell gift, but tells him not to open it yet. Jiraiya talks to Sasuke, and wagers he and Naruto learned things they shouldn't, and confirms Sasuke can erase their memory. Sasuke erases their memory with his Sharingan, along with anyone they met in the past. Hinata and Neji find Naruto and Jiraiya passed out in the forest. While in transit back to the present, Karasuki explains it's able to go to another era again, having absorbed some of the Nine-Tails' chakra when it leaked to recharge. It takes Boruto's suggestion of doing something it wants as a command after they leave. Back in the present, Konohamaru finds them. Sasuke informs Naruto of Urashiki's defeat, and credits Boruto with determining Urashiki's real target, which allowed them to intervene. Naruto tells Sasuke he should stay in the village a bit more, and despite still having to further investigate Kaguya's ruins, Sasuke intends to return to the village more frequently.

Namida and Sarada are sad they won't be able to see her as often, as the new facility Sumire will be at is at the outskirts of the Land of Fire. Sarada wants to throw Sumire a farewell party, and plans to invite their Academy class mates. On their way to learn about their new team-mate from Hanabi, a girl appears on Namida and Wasabi's way, forcing Wasabi to change directions to avoid a collision, and the girl moves in a way that makes Wasabi fall. The girl is unimpressed by Konoha shinobi and leaves. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss the appointment of Sumire's replacement, a samurai from the Land of Iron, Mifune's last disciple, something Shikamaru says is unprecedented. Wasabi and Namida meet up with Hanabi, who chastises them for being late, and the girl they met earlier confirms her earlier opinion. Hanabi introduces her as Tsubaki Kurogane, their new team-mate, and asks them to show her around while she goes on a mission after Bingo Book criminals. Tsubaki rebukes Namida's attempts at conversation, and assures the two she's only there because she was ordered by her superiors, deeming there's nothing for her to learn in Konoha, and that she'll return home when her term is up. Wasabi wants to test Tsubaki's skill, and prepares to fight. Tsubaki takes position, but calls it off, saying that if she had drawn her blade, Wasabi would be dead. Wasabi thinks samurai are just talk, and Tsubaki thinks her higher-ups don't realise shinobi lack conviction. Sarada and Ch\u014dch\u014d give the boys invitations for Sumire's farewell party, and inform them of her samurai replacement. The new Team 15 arrives, and readily antagonises the others. At the end of the day, Tsubaki thanks Wasabi for showing her around, which she felt proves her assessment of shinobi's lack of conviction. At night, Wasabi and Namida discuss their situation, before spotting one of the criminals from Hanabi's mission. Tsubaki thinks back to when she was told to go to the Land of Fire, and spots Namida and Wasabi tailing the criminal. The criminal spots Wasabi and Namida, and is joined by his two comrades. The girls and the criminals fight. When the criminals get the upper hand, Tsubaki arrives, and concedes that Wasabi standing up for Namida improved her opinion of shinobi a bit. She defeats the criminals. When Hanabi arrives, she scolds Namida and Wasabi for getting involved without clearance. Sumire introduces herself to Tsubaki and thanks her for protecting her friends. Tsubaki admits there's a lot she doesn't know and wishes to learn. The next day, Sumire's farewell party takes place, with all her Academy friends giving her gifts and words of encouragement.

By Hanabi's request, Hinata invites her family, and suggests that Hiashi will be happy to get surprise gifts from Boruto and Himawari. Having no idea what to get him, Boruto asks Sarada and Mitsuki for advice. They have no idea, and Boruto enlists Mitsuki to help him. They try sneaking into the Hy\u016bga compound, but are caught by Hanabi, who confesses she also has no idea what her father would like. Gatai from Kumogakure arrives and issues a challenge to Hiashi, based on renown and claim of strength. Boruto and Mitsuki hide from Hiashi, who has Hanabi say he's away. Gatai doesn't believe her, and concludes Hiashi must be weak. Hanabi explains Hiashi always turns away such challengers, which further confuses Boruto. Hanabi reports back to Hiashi, who clarifies his claim of Hy\u016bga strength isn't about force, something he wishes he had realised sooner, as he looks to a photo of himself, Hinata, Hizashi, and Neji. Boruto discusses Hiashi with Mitsuki, noting that while he dotes on his grandchildren, everyone else mentions how strict he was in the past. Mitsuki asks if something happened that triggered a change in him. Gatai and his attendant arrive at the Lightning Burger, boasting of having Hiashi scared of facing him. Fed up with his bad-mouthing of Hiashi, Boruto challenges Gatai. Boruto easily evades Gatai's attacks, and enrages him when saying he wouldn't even be a match for Hanabi. Gatai's attacks cause damage to their surroundings, and when Boruto decides to use the Rasengan, Hiashi stops their battle, having heard the name Hy\u016bga was invoked in a duel. Blaming his own lack of foresight for Boruto's action, he accepts Gatai's challenge. Gatai backs down and leaves. Boruto is impressed with Hiashi's power, but Hiashi stresses that using power and fear to settle things breeds tragedy and enmity. Boruto doesn't understand why Hiashi allows himself to be mistaken for weak, and can't stand others making fun of him. Hiashi admits he has no standing to lecture Boruto, and that he lived a very different life until he learned better, but refuses to elaborate and leaves. Mirai arrives, having heard shinobi were fighting, and Boruto says it was just a misunderstanding. Learning that Mirai's mother Kurenai used to be Hinata's team captain, Mitsuki suggests asking her for insight on Hiashi. Mirai takes them to her mother, who has an idea of what Boruto wants to know, but is unsure if she should speak of internal family matters. Mirai and Mitsuki excuse themselves, and Kurenai tells Boruto of the Hy\u016bga Affair and how it shaped Hiashi. Mitsuki asks if Boruto knows what to gift him, and Kurenai points out that his past is why he cherishes time with his grandchildren so much. On his birthday, Himawari gives Hiashi a scarf, and much to Hiashi's surprise, Boruto wants to take a family photo, to have as a record that they're happy. Hiashi is overcome with emotion. At night, after Hinata and the children are asleep, Hiashi asks Naruto if he gave Boruto the idea while he makes them tea. Naruto says it was all Boruto. Hiashi thanks Naruto for changing Neji, him, and the Hy\u016bga. The next day, Mitsuki and Sarada ask Boruto what he got for Hiashi.

Tsuru binds Enko with her hair, and D\u014dshu reinforces it with his restraints, but she breaks free, forcing him to knock her out with a blowgun. Team 40 discusses their situation with Team 7, who point out her clan's possession summoning never went out of control when they were in the Academy. Because Enko's rampage sent their sensei to the hospital, they're assigned Ibiki Morino as their new team leader. Team 40 is intimidated by his reputation. Ibiki wants to disband Team 40, and use Enko's abilities in interrogations, as he considers D\u014dshu and Tsuru incapable of getting over their fear of her, and says no one overcomes their fears. They think Ibiki's reliance on tranquillisers to subdue Enko when she goes out control isn't good for her. Ibiki leaves with Enko, and tells D\u014dshu and Tsuru they'll be transferred to new teams. Later, D\u014dshu and Tsuru discuss Enko's willingness to go with Ibiki. Team 7 offers to help them in any way they can. Going through a psychology book, Sarada suggests they turn their fear into interest, and try making it fun. They watch a scary movie, but Sarada is the only one scared during it. The next suggestion, by Mitsuki, is about getting used to the fear until their bodies feel safe in the situation. Team 7 takes them to the zoo, where they got permission to get close to the giant-maned wolf. D\u014dshu and Tsuru give it a try, without much success. Boruto spent the day bothered by Ibiki's claim that no one overcomes their fear. Tsuru and D\u014dshu try picking up a stray cat, but it gets scared of them and runs. Ibiki tells Enko that her former team leader informed him that her thoughts and feelings are what's triggering her episodes. Enko says she first decided to wear gloves to obscure her affected arms after a friend saw her clan's jutsu was passed down to her and got scared of her, and that it worked for a while, until her team-mates saw it. His mention of them being assigned to new teams triggers her jutsu, and she destroys Ibiki's blowgun before he can tranquillise her, and decides to leave the village. While Ibiki mobilises shinobi to go after her, wanting to seal her arms, and cut them off if necessary, he orders D\u014dshu and Tsuru to stay behind. They follow him anyway until they find her, and he explains that what triggers Enko to go out of control isn't fear, it's loneliness. Ibiki shields them from Enko's attacks. D\u014dshu and Tsuru apologise for making Enko feel lonely, and she manages to regain control. Tsuru asks Ibiki if he understood Enko because he also feels lonely over being perceived as scary. He doesn't give a conclusive answer. Team 40 finishes their lost pet mission, working together without issue.

Inojin attempts to stop Ino, but she overpowers him anyway. He tries it on his father, who allows him to try speaking to Ino. He apologises profusely, but the generic nature of his apology angers her more. Inojin leaves Sai's body, and Ino chastises him for bring their son into the fight. Inojin tries going into Ino again, he admits hasn't mastered it, messing it up halfway, and tells her how he heard she once saved Sai with the jutsu, which is why he wants to master it, so he can protect others. While they talk, Ch\u014dch\u014d gives Sai advice on what to do to end their fighting. Ch\u014dch\u014d tells Inojin to leave, and he sees his father hugging his mother.

Boruto and Mitsuki think back to being assigned a mission to infiltrate the prison, and collect information on who the leader of the Mujina Bandits is from a former member before the bandits can have him killed inside. Boruto and Mitsuki were sent because arrangements to have Kokuri protected inside would take too long, as Kusagakure, who administers the prison, hasn't been targeted by the Mujina's crimes, so they don't feel obligated to prioritise obtaining that information. Konohagakure was able to arrange with the master of the prison to have a fake brand applied to Boruto and Mitsuki. Sarada is to infiltrate the prison by posing as a journalism student conducting research. Boruto and Mitsuki are introduced to their cell-mates, and claim to be from the Land of Water, serving eight years for robbery. Benga shows Sarada around and answers her questions.

They arrange a signal to let them know when they can move Kokuri. Kedama spots one of Mitsuki's lookout snakes, but assures them he's only there for the bird droppings. Concerned about Kedama's history of snitching, Mitsuki follows him, and binds him with snakes, surprising him by being able to use ninjutsu. Mitsuki can tell Kedama is hiding something, and sympathises with him, recalling his own time infiltrating enemies. Kedama reveals how his plan to escape with his friend Kiku resulted in his death. Benga discovered Kiku, and instead of allowing their deaths making them martyrs to inspire other prisoners to keep defying the staff, he lied and said Kedama reported the escape attempt, turning the inmates against him. Kedama didn't deny it because he felt guilty over being late to escape with Kiku, and assures Mitsuki he won't tell anyone. Doragu, who in reality answers to Benga, reports that Boruto has asked about the food supply ships, and that Sarada has asked Tsukiyo about his relationship with Benga. Benga has guards look for Sarada, who creates a distraction to turn the tank valve. Benga intercepts Sarada underground, and when she tries to force him to leave her alone by implying her knowledge of his abuse of power, he attacks her with Fire Release. She dodges it, but his attacks hit a gas line, and the explosion causes the floor to collapse, and Sarada falls through. Kedama overhears Benga calling off the search for Sarada, and his command to stay away from the gas leak in the underground, but makes no mention of it to Boruto and Mitsuki. Despite the lack of signal, Boruto trusts that Sarada managed to carry out her part of the plan, so their escape is still on schedule.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "146", "Episode Title": "Executing_the_Prison_Break!", "Japanese Airdate": "1 March 2020", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto and Mitsuki move Kokuri around at night, Mitsuki relying on his snakes to alert him of the guards' movements.

Benga goes through Sarada's belongings, and finds evidence of her working with Boruto, Mitsuki, and Kokuri. Benga goes to Boruto's cell, where he destroys Boruto's shadow clone with a fire punch. He orders the guards to find them, with orders not to engage them and notify him. The prisoners are riled up by an escape attempt. Benga fails to have Kedama inform on the fugitives. After he leaves, Kedama discovers a hole dug up by Mitsuki. Boruto tells the others his shadow clone was discovered. Sarada wakes up, and is surprised by the presence of seawater underground, before moving to join the others, and notices the rising water level. Benga discovers Sarada's notes on using the old water tank. Benga sends a summoning after the fugitives. The two-headed, fire-breathing hound attacks them. Mitsuki uses Lightning Release to collapse the ceiling on it. They arrive at the water tank just in time for it to finish emptying. They need to keep moving to avoid Benga's hound. Sarada is saved from the rising water by Kedama, who explains the location was part of his failed break out plan involving the spring tide, and that Benga is aware of theirs. He directs her to the tank, and she moves on ahead to join the others. Boruto and the others find barrier tags, which they discover to trigger the Heavenly Prison. The hound catches up to them, and so does Benga, who explains the hound is passed down by wardens to hunt down fugitives. The hound dodges Mitsuki's Lightning Release, and knocks him down when he tries to restrain it. Kokuri attempts to flee, but triggers the Heavenly Prison. Sarada arrives, and punches a hole in the ground, allowing the spring tide to remove Kokuri's Heavenly Prison and wash away Benga and his hound. Kedama walks around, and comes across Doragu. He tells Doragu he's free to snitch to Benga, and Doragu notices Kedama's Heavenly Prison is undone. Benga prevents Haie from asking reinforcements from Kusagakure. He tries to claim his reward from Tsukiyo, but he can tell Benga is lying. He has Benga remove his Heavenly Prison by promising to take care of Kokuri's accomplices, and kills Benga.

Sarada compares his jutsu to the Nara clan's. Tsukiyo explains that under a full moon, his jutsu can manifest the most of its power, and manifests shadow versions of the genin, which can also use their jutsu. Since the shadows are evenly matched, they attempt to attack Tsukiyo himself, but the shadows intercept the genin. Kokuri despairs. Prison guards discover Benga's body. As they fight, the genin realise that their shadows are also using their chakra for using jutsu. Kokuri hands Boruto a notebook with every information on the Mujina Gang he has, in case Tsukiyo kills him. The guards turn on the searchlights, looking for escapees. Kokuri notices the shadows avoid having their connection with the genin under the searchlights. Tsukiyo uses his lightning to take down the men operating the searchlights. Kokuri protects Boruto from his shadow's attack. Sarada punches the ground, the dust giving them cover. Prison guards find Tsukiyo, who attacks them with the genin's shadows. Kokuri informs the genin of what he has discerned about Tsukiyo's jutsu. The genin attack their shadows and Tsukiyo, creating a smokescreen and a distraction, giving Kokuri time to get to a searchlight, which dissipates the shadows. Tsukiyo procures a sword out of his own shadow, which doesn't fade under the searchlight. Mitsuki and Sarada accelerate Boruto at Tsukiyo, who is thrown out of the cliff side. Tsukiyo pulls Kokuri down from a rock halfway down where he landed, but the rock breaks, and both of them fall down to the ocean. Mitsuki stops Boruto from going after them, noting the strong currents. Kokuri manages to get back, reminding them of his swimming aptitude, claiming Tsukiyo ran out of strength and drowned. Prison guards arrive with Konoha shinobi, including Sai, who explains that Naruto got concerned after they lost contact with Muj\u014d, so he contacted and coordinated with Kusagakure. Sai also informs them that while bold, their escape attempt was unnecessary, as Kokuri's sentence had been unlawfully extended. Boruto passes Kokuri's intel on to Sai. They depart H\u014dzuki Castle, once again under Muj\u014d's authority. At the Konoha Police, Kokuri corroborates his intel on the Mujina Bandits, including their boss and his jutsu, and later leaves under a new identity. He arrives at a Mujina Bandits hideout, where he reveals himself as their leader Shojoji, who had taken Tsukiyo's identity to go after Kokuri, and then Kokuri while the two where under the water.

Sasuke told Boruto that what's happening isn't normal, and that he should be on his guard, and let him know if anything changed, while he investigated it on his own. The news reports on the robbery of Konoha Bank. One of the robbers, from the Mujina Bandits, is suddenly apprehended by Mitsuki with his extended arm. Sarada lands a hit on another, and exchanges a few blows before defeating him. She is not impressed with them, though the third bandit says she is nothing compared to their boss. The third bandit attacks her, Sarada blocks his attack, but he extends a poisoned blade, which Sarada struggles to hold back. The bandit says he'll take her corpse to his boss. Boruto arrives and lands a kick on him, finding it unusual for her to be struggling. Out-numbered, the bandit runs away, hiding with a smoke bomb. Sarada notes the plan is working, as they can now track him to his boss. However, because he wasn't listening to the plan, Boruto doesn't let him get away, and defeats him with a Rasengan, much to Sarada's chagrin. Sarada berates him for not following the plan. Boruto wants to leave to meet with Shikadai. Despite the plan not working, Konohamaru still considers it a successful outcome. Ibiki reports to Naruto that Katasuke was being influenced by someone outside the village, and is in great shock over the realisation of his actions after being freed from control. Under that control, Katasuke also leaked information about the Kote. Naruto has Ibiki and Sai continue investigating, while Shikamaru deals with Katasuke.

Tent\u014d judges Boruto's clothes, expecting the Hokage's son have more lavish clothing. Konohamaru tells Boruto that for the next few days, he'll be Tent\u014d's bodyguard, while the daimy\u014d is at a conference in Konoha. Boruto, having taken an immediate dislike to Tent\u014d, doesn't want to take up the mission. However, Konohamaru informs him that the Daimy\u014d himself asked for him.

He attacks with electrified shuriken, and the Rasengan, but Shojoji reflects them with his Wind Release. Boruto attempts attacks with shadow clones from different directions, but Shojoji reflects them as well. Boruto's following attacks almost land, the previous ones being distractions.

They comment on how it's been difficult to schedule the class with the recent group being involved in so many incidents, and they hope they class uncovers someone with an aptitude to medical ninjutsu. Sarada worries about taking the class, since she didn't have any aptitude for it when it was taught at the Academy. Sarada overhears Shikadai and Inojin talking about how perfect the Hokage is, unaware they're talking about trading cards, and feels compelled to excel as she intends to be Hokage. The next day, she attends the class with Hako, Wasabi, Inojin, D\u014dshu, and Iwabee. They all either assume her aptitude, or count on her to help them if they struggle. Sarada perks up when Sakura explains they'll begin with a lecture followed by a written exam, as she's better at those than in practical application. In the first practical part of the class, Sakura has them mix coffee and milk, and then separate them again with delicate chakra control. D\u014dshu and Wasabi end up spilling the mixture, and Sarada panics as she only mixes it up more. Iwabee manages the separate the mixture, but the effort makes him thirsty, so he drinks a bit of Sarada's mix by accident, switching their glasses when she has her eyes closed focusing.

Naruto admits he can't use medical ninjutsu, and Boruto lists other things he has trouble doing. The class continues, and Inojin is able to perform the healing, so Sarada asks him for tips. Sakura is called to deal with an emergency, and Shizune reveals to Sarada that Sakura didn't pick up medical ninjutsu quickly, and had to go through a lot of training with Tsunade.

Eh\u014d wants to be Himawari's rival, and is surprised that she still doesn't know if she wants to be a shinobi.

She died and lost her reputation, while Kaneki just got wealthy. Mitsuki exposes the killer as Samidare, and wonders if he's killing those who ruined her sister's reputation. Samidare says he only wanted the truth at first, knowing Mikazuki wouldn't have gone ahead with a dangerous project. However, they just made excuses and disparaged the dead, so Samidare killed them. He asks Mitsuki not to interfere, but as a Konoha shinobi, he has to. Mitsuki believes Samidare to be in a dilemma, as he knew Mitsuki was a shinobi, having seen his forehead protector, but mentioned his sister's name anyway, something that could lead to someone stopping his revenge. Samidare says he has no problem with his resolve. It begins raining. Samidare uses his Water Release, which Mitsuki blocks, and counterattacks with Lightning Release. Mitsuki explains how he deduced how Samidare's jutsu worked. Samidare tries killing himself with his jutsu. The next day, the investigation on the plant accident is reopened, and Mitsuki visits a comatose Samidare in the hospital, putting the collar he bought for Mikazuki on his wrist.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "156", "Episode Title": "I_Can't_Stay_in_My_Slim_Form", "Japanese Airdate": "12 July 2020", "episode synopsis text": "Ch\u014dji demonstrates their clan's Butterfly Mode to Ch\u014dch\u014d, but she's uninterested in training it.

He leaves, and Anko joins Ch\u014dch\u014d and they order more sweet bean foods. The shop owner says they've run out of sweet beans, and they haven't been able to resupply because of bandits stealing their deliveries. Bad harvests have increased the demands, so bandits are stealing beans to sell them at a higher price. Other shops are in similar situations. They're supposed to get a delivery the following day, so Anko and Ch\u014dch\u014d decide to safeguard it. The delivery is attacked, and Anko stresses they must be careful not to damage the beans.

Sai congratulates them on their intelligence work, and requests them to notify the nearby Anbu teams that he and Sasuke will continue alone. Sai notices that rebuilding hasn't progressed in Amegakure. They venture inside the building, and are watched by someone. Sai and Sasuke trigger a trap, exposing the one watching them and subduing him. The man accuses them of killing his friends. Sai tells the man they're Konoha shinobi, and Sasuke asks to hear the man's story, as the ones who killed their friends might be the same ones they're looking for. The man introduces himself as Garashi T\u014dno. He explains he learned ninjutsu from an old man who raised orphans like him who lost their families during wars. Garashi isn't sure when Sai asks about Kara, but recognises the name, and shows them a design he copied from them. They investigated them when Kara showed up, glimpsing something like an experiment, but they were spotted, and all but him perished to poisoned gas. Parts of the building collapsed behind him, but Garashi is sure that there are still places with the gas. Garashi asks why it took the Land of Fire so long to act if this is something in their interest. Sasuke asks Garashi to take them to Kara's hideout. Garashi asks them to help him recover his friends' remains in return. At the hideout, Garashi warns them not to wander in side paths, and that depending on the airflow, the places with poison gas changes. They arrive at a blocked passage, which Sasuke breaks open with Chidori. Garashi rushes in. Sasuke and Sai follow him, and when they find Garashi on the floor, they're caught in a trap as gas begins filling the room. The real Garashi appears with a gas mask, and reveals he killed his friends with the gas because no one would save them, but Kara offered him hope. Garashi leaves them to pass out, and considers releasing more poison to deal with their allies. Sasuke and Sai show up, the ones Garashi trapped being clones. Sai explains he was careful avoiding dangerous areas along the way, but rushed in near the end, and though getting close to his friends would make him emotional, Sasuke noticed a strange calm to him. Garashi tries escaping, but begins to suffer the effects of the poison gas. Even if Kara wants him to die, he refuses to let Konoha learn anything, and kills himself. The building begins to collapse, so Sai draws a bird for them to escape. They spot some of what remained from experiments, but can't investigate. They conclude that not only they confirmed that Kara actually exists, but also that they have sympathisers. Back in Konoha, they report to Naruto and Shikamaru. Sasuke adds that Kara's experiments are likely biological, as he's seen similar equipment when he was with Orochimaru. Sai asks if Naruto saw Ino's report on Katasuke. She was able to determine a third party had been influencing him. Naruto wants to reinstate him, as testing without him has slowed down considerably, something they can't afford when their work has been leaked.

He adds that with only one tomoe, her Sharingan doesn't give her enough perception to read her opponent's moves, the Chidori requiring at least two tomoe Sharingan to be used. Sarada wants to train to awaken more tomoe, but Sasuke reveals that it doesn't work like that, only heightened emotions from extreme situations can awaken more tomoe. Sasuke proposes helping Sarada master her one tomoe Sharingan first. Knowing what Sarada struggled with during her last mission, he has her dodge a barrage of projectiles. She fails, but isn't disheartened by it, and asks to keep going. Konohamaru and Mugino investigate Victor's company, but are only shown more legitimate labs. Discussion gets more aggressive when they ask about the Hashirama Cell, but Konoha can't force the issue without escalating it into a diplomatic incident. Himawari misses her brother during dinner, and Hinata explains Boruto's determination for getting stronger. When Boruto asks for advice on his training, Kakashi refuses it, but instead tells him what Naruto learned when training wind nature transformation. Boruto feels frustrated, blaming himself for Mitsuki's injury, and envying how strong Kakashi was at his age. Kakashi points out the hardships he had to endure, and envies Boruto for growing up in an era of peace. He hands Boruto a lunchbox Himawari dropped for him, telling him he's not alone, which gives Boruto an idea. Sarada fails to dodge another barrage, and Sasuke tells her not to focus on all targets, and instead focus on the area of the attacks. Sarada also thinks back to Mitsuki's injury, and asks for another barrage. Boruto manages to add wind nature to his Rasengan with the aid of a shadow clone, and passes out from exhaustion. Sakura watches Sarada training.

The next day, they meet up with Team Shinki, and inform them of the restaurant incident. They arrive at the general area where Shikadai defeated the puppet, and they have Araya quickly canvas the area with his Sansh\u014duo puppet. Araya finds the puppet. Deepa arrives at the scene, and Shikadai warns Team Shinki that he was present in the restaurant incident. From Deepa's words, Shikadai deduces he's the one who defeated Team 7. Deepa attacks with his cubes, and Shinki blocks with his Iron Sand Wall. Deepa manages to break through, hitting Araya and Yodo. Ch\u014dch\u014d and Inojin make separate attacks from two different directions, allowing Shikadai to pin Deepa with his shadow. Shinki attacks him, but his Black Iron Fist has no effect. Deepa breaks through Shikadai's shadow, and shatters Shinki's Iron Sand Wall with a single cube. Deepa collects the puppet and turns to leave, noticing his hand steaming.

Shikadai thinks Boruto wants to get stronger because he hates Deepa, but Boruto denies it, and explains that fighting Deepa made him realise how inexperienced and lacking in power he is. Shikadai offers to help him train. Hinata arrives to give Boruto a lunchbox, and considers making an extra one for Shikadai. Sarada continues practising with Sasuke, now dodging kunai. She almost dodges them all, and Sasuke notices her problem is endurance, as she couldn't keep her Sharingan active during all of it. He congratulates her on improving her perception. During a break, Sasuke asks her how her eyes are taking the strain. Sarada says they're fine, and having researched about it and not found much, she asks him about the Mangeky\u014d Sharingan. She asks if he thinks she can awaken it, but Sasuke postpones the conversation. Sakura arrives, and Sarada tells her of her progress. Sakura is concerned with the strain she's putting on herself, and Sasuke assures her he's making sure Sarada doesn't overdo it.

As both Naruto and the shadow clone land back on the ground, Naruto transforms his shadow clone into a giant shuriken, intend on hurling it at Kakashi.

Deidara marvels at the artistic architecture of Suna, but claims that an explosion is the truest, most beautiful form of art, and therefore he will relish at Suna's destruction.\n\nBack in Konoha, Kakashi runs through the woods as he spots both Naruto and Sakura hiding behind their trees. He believes it to be a rookie mistake, and reminisces back to their first bell test, when Sakura and Sasuke managed to hide properly but Naruto could not. He is awakened from memory lane by shuriken hurtling towards him, thrown by Naruto. As he evades the attack, Sakura comes from behind and uses her massive strength to break the ground beneath him. Kakashi heads for the tree branches, only for Naruto use his Shadow Clone technique and send multiple shadow clones against him. Kakashi decides to use taijutsu to deal with the clones; however, after there are only three clones remaining, Kakashi opens the First Gate and uses the Front Lotus on the three Naruto shadow clones, both Naruto and Sakura recognising the technique as one Rock Lee uses. After the three shadow clones are taken care of, Kakashi wonders where the real one is, only for the real Naruto to announce his presence and come barrelling at Kakashi with the intent of using One Thousand Years of Death. Kakashi, horrified at the mere thought of being struck by that technique, evades the attack and retreats. \n\nAs Naruto and Sakura continue to head through the woods to find Kakashi, they are stopped in their tracks by an injured Sasuke.

Naruto then creates a shadow clone to prepare his Rasengan, and uses Rasengan on the tree that Kakashi is hiding behind. Kakashi manages to dodge the Rasengan, and ponders on a time when it was easier to fool Sakura with a genjutsu. Naruto claims that he would never fall for any of Kakashi's old tricks, only to spot the bells on the floor. Exclaiming that Kakashi must have dropped them while dodging, Naruto rushes towards them before Sakura can stop him. Naruto is ensnared by a rope before he can get the bells, prompting Kakashi to state that Naruto still falls for the same old tricks. However, the Naruto trapped by the rope turns out to be a shadow clone while the real Naruto, claiming an old trick like that would not work on him, rushes from behind and punches Kakashi right in the face, only for the latter to use a Body Replacement Technique and retreat once more.\n\nBack in Suna, Deidara believes his infiltration of the village to be successful only to be stopped by Gaara, who claims that this is as far as Deidara gets.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "172", "Episode Title": "A_Signature_of_Fear", "Japanese Airdate": "1 November 2020", "episode synopsis text": "Team 5 visits a hospitalised Boruto, Iwabee trying to wake him up with his favourite Lightning Burger.

The shock isn't enough to paralyse Suigetsu, only annoying him, but Orochimaru interrupts the fight before Suigetsu can hurt anyone.

Several young shinobi are impressed, but Inojin is uninterested. Ino lectures them on the history of the barrier team, and how the new system has been improved and automated with the help of the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team. She explains that since the system can only detect unregistered chakra signatures once an intruder actually crosses the barrier, a swift response team is necessary. Ino has gathered shinobi with sensory skills to run an operational test and collect additional data. There will be organised infiltration teams, and their job will be to apprehend them. Boruto and Shikadai meet up with Inojin. Inojin explains he was asked to join because he scored good grades in sensing, having learned the basics from his mother from a young age. Boruto and Shikadai were asked to be part of the infiltration team, and as a ch\u016bnin, Shikadai was asked to memorise the newest additions to the Bingo Book. Fellow Yamanaka clansman Kohan introduces himself as Inojin's partner for the trial, and thanks them for their contribution.

Inojin and Kohan receive a breach notification and depart. Inojin isn't able to apprehend a single target that morning, and Kohan is surprised to learn he never actually sensed before. Ino is excited about the trial, but apologises for making Inojin participate when he has little interest in the subject, and says he doesn't have to be part of the afternoon test. Inojin confesses to Sai he thinks Ino is disappointed in him. Sai explains that beyond being a Yamanaka, the reason Ino takes such interest and pride in sensing is because of her father, who died in the war. She was inspired by him, and doesn't force Inojin because she wants to inspire him as well. Inojin asks Kohan to help him hone his sensing. During the afternoon test, Inojin is able to find Shikadai, but actually detected someone else near him. Kohan checks in with the team, but the chakra signature Inojin sensed was registered. Inojin is still concerned about it, and Shikadai, knowing Inojin, convinces Kohan to pursue the matter, arguing that as a trial, this data should be significant. They meet up with Boruto, and go investigate. The person whose chakra he detected, Mokume Arai, was not even in the village, having left the day before on the train for a friend's wedding.

Hy\u014di Yorishiro has the ability to mimic others' chakra, so he's capable of crossing the barrier without reading as an unrecognised signature. They report their findings and suspicions. They arrive at an area filled with people, and based on his earlier performance, Inojin doesn't think he can't cover such a wide area. Instead, he draws several birds with his Super Beast Imitating Drawing. As they're made with his chakra, he can use them as a medium to extend the scope of his sensing. They find and apprehend Hy\u014di. Kohan reports to Ino, who agrees Inojin isn't cut for sensing, but adds he doesn't have to be, and that's enough for her.

Shikamaru asks Ao if his father truly believed his strategy to stop the Ten-Tails would work. Ao confesses he had doubts, and asked Shikaku and Inoichi the same. They said they were proud of their children and had faith in them. Shikamaru and Ino are moved. Ao leaves. At Temari's behest, Shikadai goes looking for his father.

He crosses a space\u2013time gate. Amado runs diagnostics on him, and reports his regeneration is declining. He offers to make him replacement body parts, but Victor refuses being his guinea pig again. He accuses Amado of being a mad scientist, who assures him all he does is for the advancement of Kara. He adds that Victor's health is being eroded by the cursed seal he used to extend his life, and replacing body parts won't solve the root of his problem. Amado is surprised Victor came to see him, as he hates him. Victor is agitated by how long Kara's plans are taking to advance, worried his body will give out before Kara's goals can be used to advance his own ambitions. Victor falls down in pain. Amado treats him before being called by Delta. Victor wakes up, having drugged himself beforehand to slip into a coma. He releases a spy drone to covertly copy data about the Vessel, a focal part of Kara's plan, which he also plans to steal. Amado finds Delta making a ruckus, and she complains that despite having him calibrate it, her right leg's reaction time is off. She wants him to do it again, but he explains Victor's in the infirmary, having had a seizure. Delta is surprised by his presence, and wishes he had died alongside Deepa. She also voices her hatred of him, Code, and Boro before leaving. Amado is called by Jigen, while Victor finishes copying the Vessel's data. Victor is surprised by phase 3 of the plans for the Vessel. Jigen asks Amado if the Vessel has reached phase 3, and why he wasn't notified immediately. Amado says he wanted to gather enough data to make sure of it as not to give Jigen false hope. Jigen wishes to test the Vessel on the surface, much to Amado's surprise, who thought tests were out of the question until the next phase. Jigen knows moving the Vessel will be noticed by shinobi, but it's a risk they have to take. Victor arrives, and having heard their talk, suggests they use his airship. Amado suspects his willingness to collaborate, but Victor plays up his worsening condition. Jigen approves, but Amado requires certain conditions, such as Victor not being aboard the airship, and being in charge of loading the Vessel and selecting the flight plan. Jigen watches as Victor leaves to begin preparations. In Konoha, Team 7 gets an official commendation for their role in resolving the issues in the Land of Valleys. Boruto asks his father to spar with him, which Naruto considers. The Vessel is loaded into the airship, and Delta is suspicious of Victor. Amado assures her that it's impossible to change its path from autopilot, and Delta says she'd love to slice them up should they fail. The airship takes off in stealth mode. At the Hokage Rock, Boruto removes his bandages, and recalls Momoshiki's words as he looks at the seal in his hand. Victor attempts to change the airship's path with a hidden mechanism, but something goes wrong and it crashes. Victor wonders if his plan was discovered, but considers that if that were so, they wouldn't have actually loaded the Vessel.

Boruto has yet to decide on what to give her, and intends buy her something when he gets payed for his missions later that day. Team 7 discusses Konohamaru's sudden departure for an urgent mission, so the genin have to go on missions without him. Sarada intends to take leadership in his absence. Walking through the village, Boruto sees a woman with a flower bouquet, and considers it as a gift for his mother. Boruto sees Mugino running by, and upon catching up with him, discovers he's running from restaurant owners, who want him to pay up the money he owes them. They know today is payday, so Mugino offers them his wallet, which barely has a coin in it. Mugino claims he gave his month's earnings to a kid with a sick sister. Boruto ends up having to pay for Mugino's debt, and is doubtful when Mugino says he'll pay him back next month. Mugino asks Boruto to take him to eat, spending the last of his money. Boruto questions why he doesn't ask Konohamaru for money as they've been friends for a long time, and is incredulous when Mugino says he considers it unethical, pointing out how he avoided paying the restaurant. Boruto is surprised that Mugino is like this, having previously found him to be serious and reliable from how he acted during missions. Mugino invites Boruto to his place to ask him for a favour. Mugino's apartment is poorly kept and sparsely furnished. Mugino explains he doesn't like the feeling of needing anything, or feeling like he doesn't want to lose thing, and wants to live as he was born, without any possessions. The apartment does have a nice view of the Hokage Rock, and Mugino explains he looks up to the Third Hokage, who looked after him after his parents died in a war. Boruto asks him to tell him about it. When he was a child, Mugino had been tasked with assassinating the Hokage when he visited a refugee camp. At night, Mugino tried to give Hiruzen flowers he picked, and opened his window. Mugino tried stabbing him while he looked for a flower vase, but Hiruzen blocked it, having figured he was an assassin by the way he moved, like he was being watched. Hiruzen noticed he had a cursed seal on him that could kill him at any moment. He allowed himself to be stabbed so Mugino's handlers lowered their guard, and used a shadow clone to defeat them. Mugino was shocked by it, and cried as Hiruzen apologised for creating a world where children were used as disposable weapons as he was. Hiruzen gave him a signed letter so that Konoha would welcome him, and wishes he would meet his grandson, who is of similar age to him. By the time, Mugino went to Konoha, Hiruzen had died, but he was able to enrol at the Academy. Mugino says not even Konohamaru knows this story. Boruto notices Mugino has a turtle, which Mugino explains he got roped into getting by a fortune-teller. He says the fortune hasn't come to pass, and the favour he has to ask is for Boruto to feed his turtle while he's away at a mission with Konohamaru, investigating a crash near the border. Mugino is sorry Boruto can't buy his mother a gift. The kid from Mugino's story comes by and thanks him for giving him money which he used to buy medicine for his sister, and gives him a basket of flowers. Mugino gives Boruto the flowers, as they'll wilt while he's gone. He also gives him a key to his apartment so he can feed his turtle. Boruto tells him to look after Konohamaru. Katasuke provides Naruto with his latest prosthetic hand, and is excited to hear about what Naruto thinks of it. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss Katasuke's disposition, and muse over still not knowing who put him under genjutsu. Naruto intends to test the prosthetic sparring with Boruto.

Jigen says that Amado is busy with matters that no longer concern Victor. Koji Kashin offers to retrieve the Vessel, as the airship carrying it did so in an area under his jurisdiction. The rest of the other Inners present agree to let him handle it and Koji says he will contact the Outer agent to assist. After the meeting is over, Victor considers retrieving the Vessel himself, and is glad his theft of the Vessel's data hasn't been discovered. He disparages Koji, who answers back, revealing he was in the same room as Victor since the beginning of the meeting. Victor moves to attack him, but Koji strikes first. Victor maintains someone tampered with his airship, but Koji incinerates him, his jutsu strong enough to overcome Victor's regeneration. Koji also destroys the drone with the stolen data. Amado has informed Jigen of what Deepa knew, having regenerated his head and brain enough for him to report back. Having no further use for Deepa, Jigen has Amado dispose of his head. Koji reports having dealt with Victor to Jigen, who in turn informs him of the precise coordinates of the airship crash, and orders him to kill anyone who has seen the airship. Konohamaru and Mugino approach the crash site. Several genin gather to watch the sparring between Boruto and Naruto. Mitsuki helps Boruto prepare. Boruto is happy his father managed to keep a promise, and is glad to have an opportunity to make up for past mistakes and show him that his grown from his training. Shikamaru confirms with Naruto he hasn't told Boruto he'll be testing a new prosthetic hand. The sparring begins with Boruto using shadow clones as decoys to attack Naruto from behind. He throws a Rasengan, which Naruto extinguishes. Boruto uses electrified shuriken to blind him, so he only spots the Rasengan when it's near him, but Naruto extinguishes it again. Boruto wants to clash their Rasengan, and uses shadow clones to propel himself at Naruto. The Boruto who has the Rasengan is a shadow clone, and real one attacks from afar with a Water Release and Lightning Release combo. Naruto blocks it with an Earth Release wall. He punches through the wall and absorbs Boruto's jutsu. Boruto heads to the wall, but Naruto kicks him from behind, knocking him down, ending the match. Naruto acknowledges Boruto's growth. Later, Naruto confirms to Boruto his prosthetic hand was a scientific ninja weapon, explaining that Katasuke developed it based on Momoshiki's ability, though it isn't capable of releasing the jutsu it absorbs. Boruto admonishes Naruto for using it when he chastised Boruto for using them before. Sasuke arrives and points out the difference is in how they're used. Sarada asks when he came back, and he says he just returned from investigating Kara. Konohamaru and Mugino enter the crashed airship and find an empty container.

Boruto attempts to use the chakra katana provided by Katasuke, but collapses from its chakra consumption. Boruto will have to activate the katana in the last possible moment. Katasuke makes adjustments to Boruto's jutsu absorbing arm. Their strategy is decided. While on the move, Ao is approached by Koji Kashin, who questions Ao's commitment due to the others' escape.

Sarada asks Boruto how Kawaki is, recalling his outbursts when she spent time with him and Naruto. Naruto arrives and offers to postpone his sparring with Boruto over the visitors. Boruto says it's no problem, and Naruto invites Kawaki to watch. Boruto and Naruto begin to spar, Kawaki recognising when Boruto uses shadow clones. He tells Boruto to just use the K\u0101ma already, activating his so Boruto's activates in response, as Boruto still can't activate it at will. Sparring resumes, Naruto and the spectators both noticing the increase in Boruto's performance. Boruto's Lightning Release is even strong enough to dispel one of Naruto's shadow clones. Boruto manages to trick Naruto with a shadow clone, but ends up defeated. He's unsatisfied with his performance, but Naruto credits him on fighting smarter. The two perform the Seal of Reconciliation, which Sarada and Himawari explain to Kawaki. Talking to Mitsuki later, Sarada feels inadequate thinking about Boruto's progress, and decides to train with her father to learn a jutsu only she can perform. Mitsuki is concerned about the risks associated with these powers. Kawaki recalls Boruto and Naruto's sparring and compares it to his own abusive training with Jigen. Kawaki asks Naruto about his training with Boruto, and Naruto invites him to join next time. Kawaki says he can't wield chakra, and is no shinobi, so Naruto explains the nature of chakra to him. Kawaki asks about shadow clones, believing using them to beat himself up to be an appropriate form of dealing with frustrations. Naruto advises against it, having done so himself in the past, and suggests having a rival. Boruto overhears them, and decides against complaining about the vase again. At the Uchiha household, Sarada and Sasuke compliment Sakura's cooking, and Sarada asks her father to train her to learn the Chidori. The next day, Kawaki collects the broken vase and prepares to glue it back together.

Delta lashes at Kawaki for endangering a body that, as a Vessel, isn't his. She doesn't answer Naruto's questions, so he dares her to kill him. The two trade several blows as Boruto, Kawaki, and Himawari watch. Naruto reminds her of his threat, saying it's too late now that she hurt Kawaki, so he'll go after everyone in Kara. He gets close to her, so she fires her eye beams, which he blocks with a Big Ball Rasengan. Delta begins absorbing it, so Naruto ups the ante by growing it into an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan. Boruto realises his strategy. Delta mocks Naruto for thinking she can't absorb bigger jutsu. Kawaki finds the strategy futile, but Boruto corrects him that's not what Naruto is doing. Delta realises Naruto's plan, and Boruto explains to Kawaki he's trying to overtax her absorption. Her shinobi-ware overheats, her eyes ceasing to function. Naruto explains he realised that when she fired back his Rasengan, it meant it was stored somewhere, and such storage would have a limit. Naruto boasts about his chakra reserves, and Delta tries physically attacking him. Naruto dodges it and grows his jutsu into a Super-Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan, landing it on her. It carves a crater on the ground, where Delta lays defeated. The children celebrate. Naruto expresses his desire to have her questioned, so Kawaki urges to have her killed immediately. Delta's body sounds off, and self-destructs. Naruto takes the kids out of the blast radius. Delta's drone retreats, witnessed by Koji through his toad, who comments that Naruto's power still isn't enough. He's convinced the key will be uncovering the secrets of the K\u0101ma through Boruto. Elsewhere, a couple argues over doctors being unable to treat their sick son. The village is visited by Boro and his followers, where he cures those who are sick. Boro talks them into believing that salvation can be achieved through the Infinite Tsukuyomi, bringing them into his cult. Later, Code visits Boro and delivers him Amado's message telling him to come in for maintenance. Boro claims he's busy, and grows aggravated when Code asks if it's fun to deceive people. Code is willing to use force to bring Boro for maintenance, so he relents. At Kara's headquarters, Jigen finishes recharging, Amado noting it's become more frequent. He reports that there have been no news about the Vessel from either Koji or Delta.

Naruto questions if he can't restore his arm, but Katasuke denies it, as the technology at his disposal isn't as advanced as Kara's, so making a prosthetic for Kawaki will take time. Naruto suggests using one of the prototypes made for him. Katasuke explains prosthetics are made to react to the wearer's chakra, so Naruto decides to keep constantly moulding chakra while he's awake to keep it functioning. He dismisses Kawaki's concern by pointing out the situation is an example of chakra as a connecting force. Boruto comments on how cool it looks and jokes about wanting one. Kawaki offers to blast off his hand, wondering if it would get rid of Boruto's K\u0101ma. Boruto explains he was joking while Naruto and Katasuke laugh. Amado finishes performing maintenance on Boro's body, who complains about it. Delta's drone arrives and connects to a terminal. Amado enters a command, and the terminal downloads her consciousness into one of two spare Delta bodies. She kicks open her container, breaking the lid, cursing at Naruto and disparaging Amado. Boro teases her about her defeat. Delta recounts the events for Boro and Code, who are surprised that Kawaki protected Naruto's daughter. Jigen quells the discussion, and reminding he told her to follow Koji's lead, asks where he is. She answers he's still in Konoha laying low, and that he allowed Konoha to take Kawaki to gather more intel on Boruto Uzumaki, who also has a K\u0101ma. The revelation surprises everyone. She adds that both Boruto and Kawaki got a power boost when their K\u0101ma resonated. Jigen considers Momoshiki's final act. Naruto discusses Kawaki with Sasuke, Sai, and Shikamaru. Sasuke agrees that keeping Kawaki away from Kara is a priority, but Shikamaru won't budge on Kawaki having a security detail assigned to him. He tasks Konohamaru with keeping an eye on Kawaki. Koji keeps watching the Uzumaki household through his toad. Kawaki asks Naruto why he's doing so much for him. Naruto says it's hardly anything considering he saved Himawari, and adds that Kawaki reminds him of himself. Kawaki asks to be taught ninjutsu, which Naruto agrees. He also begins gluing Himawari's vase back together. While training Kawaki, Naruto, Boruto, and Mitsuki consistently have to remind him not to use scientific ninja tools or rely on his K\u0101ma. Sasuke prepares to train Sarada to learn the Chidori, and gives her a demonstration. Boro overhears Code and Amado, learning that there is a traitor, and offers to kill everyone and assemble new Inners. Sarada practices the Chidori, and is given pointers by Sasuke before he is summoned by Sai. She runs into Boruto, Kawaki, and Mitsuki, who are buying Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls cards. Boruto is sullen for getting another card of his father, and Kawaki gets a rare Fourth Hokage card, which he offers to trade with Boruto.

He has some concept of tailed beasts from reading Kara's files, and assumes that having Kurama sealed in him is why Naruto leads Konohagakure. Kurama corrects him, explaining the parallels between Naruto's life and Kawaki's, and summarising all the antagonism it posed to Naruto through the years, from causing him to hurt those close to him, to how the village mistreated him for being Kurama's jinch\u016briki. It comments on the irony of Naruto's use of the Shadow Clone Technique and his loneliness, Kawaki himself recalling Naruto's words on the jutsu. Kurama continues, mentioning how it saw Naruto fill his heart up through the years, and how he's at his strongest when protecting his friends. Kawaki tears up learning about Naruto, and Kurama tells him it's pretty late, so he should look for the missing vase piece the next day. The following day, Kawaki recalls how Jigen trained him, and learns walking up trees from Naruto. Sarada and Mitsuki watch from afar, and while sympathetic to Kawaki's circumstances, she is jealous of the treatment he gets from Naruto. Mitsuki points out it's natural for that to happen, as Naruto treats everyone in the village like family, even willing to let him be part of it. After training, Naruto asks Boruto about the pain from K\u0101ma. Boruto says it hasn't hurt in a while, and Kawaki reveals his hasn't hurt in a while either. Determined not to be outdone, Sarada comments that Sasuke has been training her, and Boruto asks her to relay the message he wants to train with him again. Boruto invites Kawaki to train with them, but he refuses, saying there's something he has to do by himself at home. Boruto tells him that while he doesn't know how Kawaki feels, he's not alone any more. Kawaki reveals it was Jigen who gave him his K\u0101ma, and he knows all about it. Boruto supports Kawaki, saying they'll defeat Jigen together. Sarada continues practising the Chidori on the waterfall. Sai and Shikamaru discuss whether Kawaki can be trusted, and the intel that Konohamaru recovered from the airship crash. In them, there was a coordinate that can only be accessed through space\u2013time ninjutsu, which they can't ignore even if it might be a trap. Sai reveals he already sent Sasuke to investigate.

Boro returns to his cult, and preaches salvation by the \u014ctsutsuki through the Infinite Tsukuyomi. He alleges that shinobi of the Five Great Shinobi Countries murdered Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki, and lied that the Infinite Tsukuyomi was a calamity. Sasuke discovers holograms for Momoshiki and Kaguya. He notices how the carvings are arranged in pairs, deducing that Kaguya also came with a partner, triggering his hologram. Boro takes children with questions to Inori, who claims to corroborate Boro's preaching. Inori's brother arrives, incapacitating two cultists with Water Release, intent on rescuing her. Inori doesn't listen to him. Boro claims that he was given an indestructible body by the god he met, and gives Inori's brother a chance to believe his words. Inori's brother slices through Boro with Water Release, but he simply regenerates. Seeing him regenerate makes the children believe him. Boro has Inori take them away and give them new clothes. Inori's brother refuses to believe Boro, who extends his hand at him, causing him to die. Boro looks at what he collected from the airship, and wonders how Koji will explain himself. Boruto practises shurikenjutsu and discusses Kawaki with Mitsuki, who advises him to be careful with the K\u0101ma since they know so little about it. Sasuke investigates some roars, and discovers a restrained Ten-Tails, much to his shock. He hides as Jigen arrives, noting his K\u0101ma. He watches as Jigen absorbs chakra from the Ten-Tails, and sprouts a horn like the one he saw in Kaguya's partner's hologram. Jigen recedes the horn, and plans to visit the two vessels. Going back home, Mitsuki asks Boruto what he'll do if the K\u0101ma is permanent.

Kawaki watches the mended vase, and Boruto tells him he's going to train and to get along with his father. Naruto wakes up, and Kurama tells him it had to intervene with Kawaki, so it will go to sleep a bit. Kawaki searches for a missing piece of the vase, but Naruto tells him Hinata cleans every day, so he's unlikely to find it. Naruto asks him if it's necessary, as it's almost completely restored. Kawaki stresses there's no point to a leaky vase, and that such comments are why Boruto yells at him. Naruto comments he got himself another strict son, but Kawaki quietly says he's not his son. Shikadai beats Iwabee at Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls, so he has to treat Team 10 a meal. Team 5 and 10 discuss the recent lack of big missions, whether Kawaki can be trusted, and their opinions on him. Koji continues to surveil Kawaki, noting a lack of action since Delta's attack. He wonders why Jigen hasn't made a move, since through Delta he must know that Boruto also has a K\u0101ma. Sarada picks up flowers her mother ordered at Yamanaka Flowers, and buys some herself. Boruto loses his footing during training, and Mitsuki notices his K\u0101ma has activated. As he can't willingly activate it yet, and knowing the circumstances in which it activates, he becomes concerned for Kawaki. Hinata and Himawari leave for groceries. As Sarada leaves her shop, Ino detects and is shaken by a sinister chakra. Kawaki's K\u0101ma releases a mass of chakra, turning into a portal through which Jigen appears. Koji watches through his toad. Boruto's K\u0101ma spreads further, and he and Mitsuki rush back to the Uzumaki house. Team 5 and 10 notice them. Koji is surprised by Jigen showing up in person, and questions the need for a retrieval mission if he could portal directly to Kawaki. Jigen notices his toad, and Koji determines Jigen was actually investigating him. Jigen nonchalantly states his purpose to collect Kawaki, and wishes Boruto was there as well. Naruto attacks, but is kicked aside by Jigen, who manifests rods to pin him down. The guards attempt to aid Naruto, despite his warnings to stand back. They're both pined as well. Jigen threatens Kawaki, and attempts to convince him the hand they gave him is a monitoring device, in a sense no different from the K\u0101ma. Kawaki continues to deny him, as he disparages Naruto and the village. His K\u0101ma spreads further, manifesting a horn, much to Jigen's surprise. Kurama berates Naruto for taking so long to remove the rods, and Naruto enters his chakra mode, kicking Jigen aside and checking on Kawaki. Jigen spreads his K\u0101ma and begins fighting Naruto. Naruto dodges the rods, but gets hit by one getting Konohamaru out of the way. Jigen prepares a blast, much to Koji's surprise, and Kawaki offers to return with him if he lets Naruto go unharmed.

Sasuke manifests his Complete Body Susanoo, prompting Naruto to fully manifest Kurama. Sasuke attacks, but Jigen is disappointed by Susanoo's speed, and kicks Sasuke out of it, putting a multiple rods through him. Jigen goes towards Sasuke, who switches places with him. Naruto attacks with Kurama's tails, but Jigen simply pins them down with more rods, and punches Naruto out of his Tailed Beast Mode. Naruto prepares a Rasengan, but Sasuke switches places with him at the last second, attempting to behead Jigen with his sword. Jigen manifests rods from his neck, blocking Sasuke's sword, and kicks him away. Jigen lands physical attacks on Naruto, and Sasuke attempts to burn him with Amaterasu. Jigen absorbs them with his K\u0101ma. Sasuke is concerned that if he spends more chakra, he won't be able to use space-time ninjutsu. Jigen notices a crack on a blackened section of his body, wondering if his power is too much for this body to contain, reaffirming his need for Kawaki as his next vessel. Jigen decides to end things, and pins Naruto and Sasuke with rods from below. Considering Naruto to take too much work to kill due to Kurama, Jigen decides to seal him instead, and begins closing the lid of the place they're in. However, as Sasuke can teleport, he intends to kill him then and there. Naruto creates shadow clones to buy time for Sasuke to escape, reasoning that if they can't defeat Jigen, one of them has to escape. Sasuke teleports back to Konoha, appearing next to Sakura. Naruto teases Jigen about not being able to track Sasuke with K\u0101ma like he can Kawaki, and wonders why he's sealing him instead of killing him. Kurama manifests itself, telling Naruto not to give him a reason to do it, as he had no issue with him before. Jigen agrees with Kurama, and asks about Boruto, revealing he knows about Boruto's K\u0101ma. He promises to kill Naruto next time they meet if he's still alive, which Naruto says right back at Jigen. He finishes closing the lid, and shrinks the seal down.

Sarada asks him what happened. Boruto and Mitsuki arrive. Sarada tells them Naruto is missing. Shikamaru arrives with backup and pins Kawaki down with his shadow. Shikamaru says what the Sensor Unit reported to him and demands an explanation from Kawaki. He gives a signal to a subordinate, and a barrier goes up around the house. Shikamaru explains it's to both keep Kawaki from fleeing and keeping enemy reinforcements out. Shikamaru orders his subordinates to look in the house in pairs for clues. He unpins Kawaki and asks what happened. Kawaki explains Jigen suddenly appeared when his K\u0101ma began hurting, forming a a crack in the air. Shikamaru recognises it as space\u2013time ninjutsu. Sarada questions why he'd take Naruto if he was after Kawaki, who explains it was to eliminate Naruto for interfering. Shikamaru and Mitsuki note that if it was just to take him out of the day, it would only take a moment, leading Shikamaru to deduce they're either still fighting, or that best case scenario, Naruto defeated Jigen but can't come back. Boruto mentions Sasuke, who he knows to have space\u2013time ninjutsu, but Shikamaru hasn't heard from him since his most recent mission. Shikamaru asks if there's anything else Kawaki hasn't said. He bluntly says he has never trusted Kawaki, and suspects Kawaki has been a Kara member all along, Naruto's disappearance only deepening his concern. Kawaki finds no fault in his logic. With Naruto absent, it falls on Shikamaru to decide what to do with Kawaki, so he decides for house arrest until they have proof he's not a spy. Boruto protests but Kawaki accepts it. Koji finds the situation unusual. He determines that Jigen ended up using too much chakra, and finds it a rare opportunity of being able to take Jigen down himself, and leaves to head back to base. Amado tends to Jigen and determines it'll take two days for his chakra to fully recharge. Jigen says he got carried away by how happy he was, due to how Kawaki's K\u0101ma is developing. Amado speculates if that is due to the resonance with Boruto's K\u0101ma, an idea Jigen supports. Jigen believes they'll both become powerful \u014ctsutsuki, and a giant God Tree will grow. He reassures Amado his wishes will be granted. Amado glances at Delta, who tells him off. Boruto refuses to believe Kawaki is a spy, but Shikamaru explains he has to be contained because they can't tell it either way. Boruto brings up Kawaki sacrificing his arm to protect Naruto and Himawari, but having heard Kara's scientist might be able to fix it, Shikamaru things it would be a good way to earn their trust, and if there is a plan, they wouldn't try killing one of their own. Kawaki thinks of Naruto, and wonders why he was good to him. Sarada understands him, and reveals she has wondered how her life would be better if Naruto was her father. She confesses being jealous of Boruto, and annoyed at his ignorance of how lucky he is. While Boruto is arguing with Shikamaru, one of his subordinates arrives with the repaired vase, wondering if it's a tool for a jutsu. Boruto takes it, berating him for thinking something so stupid, and marvels at it being fixed. Kawaki points out he's the one who complained about it, and that there's still a small hole in it. Shikamaru still doesn't accept it as proof Kawaki isn't a spy. Kawaki's prosthesis lights up with Naruto's chakra, Kawaki taking it as proof Naruto is alive. Kawaki can sense Naruto's chakra through the prosthesis, and looking at his K\u0101ma, he asks for Boruto's assistance. Kawaki activates his K\u0101ma, forming a portal like Jigen's, and Boruto's K\u0101ma resonates, activating and contributing to the portals formation. Kawaki makes a realisation he can do the same things as Jigen because he's like him, and decides to go rescue Naruto. Boruto denies Kawaki is anything like Jigen. Shikamaru pins the children with his shadow, with no intention of letting them go. Kawaki breaks it by absorbing it, and warns the portal will close soon. Mitsuki grabs Sarada and Boruto and jumps through. Kawaki goes through it, telling Shikamaru he's going to get his proof.

Sarada and Boruto are confused, because she saw him weave hand seals, meaning it's ninjutsu, while Boruto points out K\u0101ma couldn't absorb it, despite having no trouble doing so to his Lava Release. Kawaki explains K\u0101ma can only absorb chakra-based substances, for example, a Water Release created by one's own chakra, but not a Water Release which controls already existing water, concluding Boro's mist isn't chakra-based. Mitsuki reveals he had his snake trap a bit of the mist, and asks Sarada to focus her Sharingan so they can learn what it is. Mitsuki warns her she'll only have one chance to analyse it before it disperses, and cautions her not to get in contact with it. Sarada is able to determine the mist is made of viruses, meaning the others were infected and are sick. Mitsuki is glad to confirm his hypothesis, which he formulated based on the symptoms they displayed. Since they also don't know of any ninjutsu which creates viruses, they conclude that Boro creates them through scientific ninja tools. Mitsuki has an idea to deal with the viruses, but stresses they need a commander, and based on her earlier idea to retreat, nominates Sarada. Sarada moves out and addresses Boro, saying they figured out his jutsu. Sarada asks him what he thinks they should do, and Boro says no ninjutsu can be used against it, and charges at her. He uses his Lava Release, which she counters with her Fire Release, maintaining a distance between them. Sarada notices he lacks speed, and uses a wide spread Fire Release, which he blocks with a water wall. Sarada loses sight of Boro, and realises he's circling her, leaving her surrounded by viruses. Sarada jumps, as Boro expected, allowing him to intercept her and toss her down where his viruses are. Boro tells her the virus acts fast, and picks her up. He dismisses her sign weaving, and she tells him she can't miss from that close a distance. She hits him a Fire Release to the face, and follows up with a punch and a signal to Boruto and Kawaki, who can move again. She notices Boro's hand seals. The boys both have their K\u0101ma activated, and Boruto lands a Rasengan, which is augmented by Kawaki, destroying Boro's head and much of his upper body. Mitsuki arrives and they celebrate the anti-bodies working. Boro stirs, gets up, and regenerates. Kawaki curses his regeneration abilities being greater than he anticipated. Boro is confused on how they got anti-bodies to counteract the virus, as they only exist in his bloodstream, before realising Mitsuki collected some of his blood when his snake bit him. Mitsuki says he likes to collect things, attributing it to Orochimaru's influence, and that if the attack happened to be actual viruses instead of ninjutsu, Boro would be the one to have anti-bodies against it. Boruto taunts him that his attack won't work anymore.

Boruto stresses Kawaki should be more careful, though Kawaki assures him he'll heal right away. Boro comments they'll have to retrain Kawaki, Boruto says Kawaki is a Konoha citizen now, and Boro responds they'll be taking him as well for his K\u0101ma. Boruto and Mitsuki go on the offensive. Boruto destroys Boro's hand with a Rasengan, but Boro regenerates it instantly, and continues to counterattack against the two. Sarada avoids using Fire Release and Lightning Release so as not to spark Boro's gunpowder, and tries shuriken, but Boro melts them with his Lava Release. Mitsuki elongates his arms and restrains Boro long enough for Kawaki to explode him with K\u0101ma, destroying his lower body. Boro regenerates once more. Kawaki asks Boruto and Mitsuki to buy him time. As the two fight Boro, Kawaki explains to Sarada that Boro's strategy is to make them exhaust their chakra with his regeneration, but that there's a way to neutralise it. Boruto attacks with shadow clones, Mitsuki attacks with snakes, and Boro once again creates gunpowder explosions, this time igniting it himself. Kawaki shares how all Kara members had their bodies modified by Amado with scientific ninja tools but even with all his genius technical skills, his design is still not flawless and that the bigger the tools are the larger their core is. For how strong Boro's regeneration is, there has to be at least a heart-sized core responsible for it, and if they can find and destroy that core, he won't regenerate anymore. Sarada points out they've destroyed all of his body parts by now, so they should have destroyed it already. He tells her to look for it with her Sharingan, and joins the others in attacking Boro. Mitsuki attacks with Lightning Release, so Boro throws gunpowder his way. Just before Kawaki blows Boro's head up, Sarada notices him weaving hand seals. She saw a slight movement in his muscles, and confirms something is moving inside him when Boruto lands another Rasengan on him, the last one he has chakra for. Sarada determines the core is in his right flank, but can't inform the others without alerting Boro, so she decides to destroy it herself. Boro resumes attacking the others. Sarada goes through her jutsu in her head, discarding the ones not strong enough to penetrate his body. She's also concerned he'll move the core the moment he notices her taking aim, and concludes she needs something faster than he can weave hand seals. She only has one such jutsu, which she's still practising, and hasn't used in battle. Sarada prepares a Chidori, which Boruto recognises as Sasuke's jutsu.

Katasuke is unable to think of a treatment as Kawaki's body is beyond his understanding, but Kawaki is unconcerned. Boruto arrives with news of Naruto's awakening. He takes Kawaki to see Naruto, who's also being visited by Sasuke, Sai, Shikamaru, Sarada, and Mitsuki. They all coordinate what they know.

Boruto recalls Delta saying that Kawaki's body didn't belong to him. Kawaki explains many others were experimented on alongside him and died. Boruto confesses to not remembering the end of the fight with Boro. Sarada and Mitsuki exchange looks. Sakura arrives and insists Naruto must rest.

Boruto invites Kawaki to go train with him and Mitsuki, but Kawaki finds it dangerous to train with him, as their K\u0101ma are resonating and further changing their bodies. He writes a note to Naruto. Himawari gets food while Hinata vacuums the house and leaves. Kawaki notices and asks why she's sneaking out. She explains she's been feeding a wolf she calls Jaggy for the past week. Kawaki notices the wolf has several scars on him. While he snarls at Kawaki, he's friendly with Himawari. He thinks the wold should get his own food, but Himawari convinces him to help her get food. They speculate on why Jaggy is the way he is. Kawaki relates to the wolf. When they return, other wolves are snarling at Jaggy, but leave as they approach. They return home, and Kawaki throws the note he wrote away. The next day, Kawaki and Himawari leave together again, and he helps her get food for Jaggy. Boruto and Mitsuki help Hinata on the garden, and they discuss Kawaki. Hinata calls for Boruto. Jaggy isn't in his cave, and Kawaki finds bear tracks near it. Himawari finds Jaggy dead, and Kawaki comforts her. She thinks that if he had been with his pack he could have survived, but Kawaki instead points that his white fur makes him stand out to other predators, and that by being alone, he protected his pack from danger. They bury Jaggy, and Kawaki tells her he has to do something alone. He goes to the village gates, but Boruto finds him there, having read the note Hinata found while cleaning. Kawaki wants to leave because he feels responsible for Jigen getting to the village through him. Boruto reminds him that they promised to defeat Jigen together, and Kawaki blames him and his family for dulling his instincts. Shikamaru shows up, knowing where Kawaki is because of his surveillance. He stops him from leaving the village. Despite arguing against having Kawaki on the village, Shikamaru will keep Kawaki in the village because that's what Naruto decided, and that like it or not, he's already a member of the village.

Delta informs Jigen that Boro is dead, having investigated it after receiving no further communication from him. She also found the remains of the Hokage's seal, with him absent. Jigen speculates Sasuke is responsible, but Delta believes it was someone much stronger. Jigen sends Code on his task and orders Delta to return. In Konoha, Shikamaru and Sai tell Konohamaru about Boro's cult. Because they believe the cult can give them answers about Kara, Naruto assigns Sai and Konohamaru to infiltrate it. The two intend to find the teleportation device Kawaki told Konoha that Kara uses to move around. They're welcomed by Akari, who informs them Boro is busy, and might not show up that day. She tells them of her background, and that her brother was chosen by Boro to communicate with the gods directly. Akari directs them to Shirabe and Tsuzumi, who might know when Boro will be present. They claim Boro is away, dealing with an outbreak in a distant village. Akari asks about her brother Kagari, and they claim that Boro informed them that Kagari's role was expanded, and that should be proud of her brother. Sai and Konohamaru are shown around by Inori, who tells them about the kind of people who have come to the cult, and reveals the salvation Boro preaches is the Infinite Tsukuyomi. They begin investigating Akari and her brother, whom the cult claims Boro communicated about the day before, even though Sai and Konohamaru know he's dead. Akari reveals she would receive letters from her brother, but those have stopped, and that she knows no chosen cultists like Kagari who have returned. They believe Kagari was sent to Kara, so they decide to stir things up, and claim to Shirabe and Tsuzumi they heard a rumour that Boro was dead from some Konoha shinobi. Tsuzumi claims to retreat to meditate, but Sai and Konohamaru discover him in a hidden room trying to contact Boro, and question him about Kara. When they discover something in the room's books, Tsuzumi throws a virus bottle at them and runs. They catch up to him, and reveal they're immune to the virus because their friends fought Boro. Other cultists arrive, and claiming they're bandits, Tsuzumi orders them to capture Sai and Konohamaru. Konohamaru reveals that Boro was the one responsible for the outbreaks they all faced, and that Boro's chosen were actually used in experiments. Sai shows them the book with the chosen marked as deceased. Shirabe claims they don't understand Boro, who hasn't deceived them at all, and spins his actions as unrestrained devotion to saving others.

The next day, Team 5 and Team 10 discuss the event. Denki and Iwabee debate whether the theft was facilitated by the data being digital instead of on paper. Inojin comments on how the village's Barrier Team detected no foreign chakra signatures, leading Shikadai to consider an inside job. Ch\u014dch\u014d wants to catch the intruder, and convinces her team-mates to help her. They find the tower where Koji was staying, and a computer with blueprints of the archive facility. Inojin spots someone nearby, who turns out to be Kakashi. He claims to be just walking around, but Shikadai deduces he's looking for the intruder as well, by himself instead of as a part of a group so as not to draw attention. They show Kakashi their discovery, and he suggests they continue investigating together, giving them earpieces. The four watch the tower, and spot Koji, but he switches directions midway to it. Inojin follows him from the sky on one of his drawings, but loses him in a crowd. Kakashi says the intruder noticed he'd been made, so he abandoned the hideout, and will try to leave the village. He considers the intruder went into the sewers to make it appear he vanished in the crowd. Knowing the intruder is dangerous from his moves and from the j\u014dnin he took out in the archives, Kakashi goes after him alone, and instructs Team 10 to notify the j\u014dnin on watch to seal the exists. Shikadai realises the intruder will leave the sewer not on the outskirts of the village, but on a Thunder Rail station. Kakashi is too far to make it in time, and Team 10 arrives as a train is leaving. Ch\u014dch\u014d enlarges her arms and throws Shikadai and Inojin on the train. Shikadai paralyses Koji, but as Inojin gets close to unmask him, the shadow clone dissipates. Koji takes out guards and infiltrates another archive facility, but Kakashi arrived before him. After being contacted by Shikadai, he realised that Koji was trying to lure the extra security away by pretending to leave the village, so he could steal data archived on physical scrolls, yet to be digitised. Wanting to know how he slipped past the Sensing Barrier, Kakashi attacks him with Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, but it's a shadow clone again. Koji creates a smokescreen and escapes. He thinks to himself the data had nothing to do with his goal and wonders if he's getting sentimental. He's confused by the lack of a counterattack by Jigen to retrieve Kawaki, and realises his last fight took a lot of his chakra. Team 10 and Team 5 discuss the chase at Senju Park. Shikadai goes talk to Kakashi, and speculates that since the physical data was only from past shinobi, the intruder might be one of these past shinobi. Considering that, Kakashi adds that the intruder's chakra might be registered, explaining why the barrier detected no intrusions. Koji returns to Kara's headquarters and meets Amado. He informs Koji of Jigen's condition, and that all other Inners are away.

Koji gives him directions and reverse summons his toad with Amado inside. Amado arrives at the outskirts of Konohagakure. Koji proceeds inside the headquarters. Team 10 trains, motivated by their failure to capture the intruder, overseen by Moegi. She leaves to get them lunch. Amado praises their training, and requests an audience with Shikamaru. Shikadai paralyses him, but Amado breaks free with a scientific ninja tool. He drugs Shikadai and puts a collar around his neck. Inojin contacts Ino, informing her of Shikadai's situation and requesting communication to Shikamaru. Katasuke reports to Naruto he'll need Kara's technology to repair Kawaki's body, the best he can do for now is the prosthetic which Kawaki's body is rejecting. Ino contacts Shikamaru and informs him that Shikadai has been captured by Amado, who strapped a bomb to his neck. Moegi returns with lunch, and is startled by Shikadai's capture. She restrains Amado with Earth Release, and backup arrives. Amado detonates a bomb like the one on Shikadai on a tree branch with a voice command, and reveals the one on Shikadai is set to explode in 48 hours. Under Sai's order, Moegi releases her jutsu. Amado apologises for his drastic measures, but stresses that time is critical and requires an audience with Shikamaru. Shikamaru talks to him through Ino's jutsu. Amado wants to talk to Shikamaru because he has decision-making authority if the Hokage is unavailable, which he believes to be the case, knowing of Naruto's loss to Jigen. Shikamaru takes this knowledge as proof of Amado's Kara membership. He asks Ino to connect the others into the conversation, and reveals to Amado that Naruto has been recovered. Kawaki confirms Amado's identity. Amado reveals his wish to defect to Konoha, in exchange for providing intel on Kara, Jigen, the Ten-Tails, and the \u014ctsutsuki, as well as releasing Shikadai. Shikamaru is furious, and Kawaki is incredulous that Amado would leave Kara. Naruto is willing to talk, in order to save Shikadai. Koji meets with Jigen, who asks for a mission report. Amado gets a rise out of Shikamaru before he is interrogated, and Naruto orders him to talk. Kawaki tells Boruto and Sumire of Amado's role in Kara, and that Jigen has never granted him leave. Katasuke expresses interest in having Amado's expertise at his disposal if his defection is approved, as it would beneficial to Kawaki. Naruto wants Amado to share some of his intel to see if it's worth it, and promises him not to use dirty tricks like Amado did. Amado agrees to it, but his glasses begin beeping. He asks Shikamaru to position them, and they begin a transmission of Jigen and Koji's meeting. Amado explains Koji is his ally. Their discussion reveals that Koji and Amado were responsible for the airship crash which allowed Kawaki to escape. Jigen wants to know why they betrayed him, and Koji attacks. Jigen evades him and pierces Koji with chakra rods, but it's only a shadow clone. Koji explains he was created to kill him.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "213", "Episode Title": "True_Identity", "Japanese Airdate": "29 August 2021", "episode synopsis text": "Koji confirms he was created to kill Jigen. Watching the transmission at Konoha, Naruto asks why they're fighting if they're both Kara members. Amado explains they were both pretending to be Kara, their true objective being killing Jigen. As he was severely drained from the fight against Naruto and Sasuke, this is an opportunity they won't have again. Jigen considers Koji to be a mere tool used by Amado, and Koji is ok with it, as that's what he considers shinobi to be. Koji attacks with Fire Release, which Jigen absorbs with K\u0101ma. While doing so, Koji positions himself behind Jigen, drenches him in oil, and places several toads on him, which burn more intensely because of the oil. Kawaki doesn't think it'll make a difference because of the K\u0101ma. Naruto recognises Koji's fighting style. Jigen absorbs the flames and engages in taijutsu against Koji. Koji uses shadow clones, but Jigen evades it and pierces one with his rods. Jigen avoids another shadow clone by shrinking, and pierces it as well. Jigen comments on Koji's seriousness in wanting him dead, and hopes he's prepared to die. Koji feels the same, and addresses Jigen as Isshiki \u014ctsutsuki. Amado explains that Isshiki came to their planet as Kaguya's partner, per the usual \u014ctsutsuki expansion method he already explained. For reasons unknown to Amado, Kaguya turned on Isshiki, leaving him on the verge of death. He only survived by taking over a novice monk that happened to be nearby, Jigen. Sasuke asks if that's when Jigen was marked with K\u0101ma. Before continuing, Amado confirms with Naruto his asylum deal, and won't remove Shikadai's collar until he has the deal in writing. Naruto does so, and Amado continues. Using Boruto and Momoshiki as an example, he reveals that K\u0101ma is actually replicated data from an \u014ctsutsuki that is implanted, comparing it to a compressed backup file. Overtime, that file is uncompressed, overwriting the will of the person marked with it until the \u014ctsutsuki who made it is reborn. Naruto asks if there's a way to block the process. Amado isn't aware of any, though he speculates that killing Boruto before he's overwritten would work. Sasuke asks what happens to the K\u0101ma in the case of a successful resurrection. Amado believes it would simply vanish, and Sasuke points out that Isshiki has taken over Jigen, but Jigen still bears a K\u0101ma. Amado chuckles, angering Shikamaru. Amado observes Sasuke's point, and explains that Isshiki didn't take over Jigen through usual means. Implanting a K\u0101ma is a significant under-taking, something Isshiki didn't have enough power to do while near death. Instead, he shrunk himself, and physically entered Jigen's body, acting as a parasite until he took over his brain, only implanting a K\u0101ma at a later point. Jigen extends his K\u0101ma and continues to fight Koji. Koji immobilises Jigen with an Earth Release. Naruto questions why Isshiki hasn't revived through Jigen. Amado explains that selecting an appropriate vessel is essential for a successful rebirth. Jigen was the only available vessel for Isshiki at the time, and his body isn't strong enough to sustain a fully restored Isshiki, so Isshiki through Jigen began preparing a more resilient vessel, Kawaki. Jigen escapes Koji's Earth Release by shrinking and sends more rods his way, which Koji dodges. Koji retracts his Earth Release, revealing summoning marks. Flames burst through, and Jigen tries absorbing them, only to discover he can't. Koji explains these are natural occurring flames he summoned from another location, and as they're not Fire Release, he can't absorb them. Amado stresses they mustn't allow Isshiki to be reborn in Kawaki's body. As long as there are K\u0101ma, the \u014ctsutsuki will remain beings who can transcend death. However, he points out it is possible to kill them, and that he'll teach them all how to do it.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "214", "Episode Title": "Predestined_Fate", "Japanese Airdate": "5 September 2021", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto is incredulous that Isshiki would absorb so much fire, and Kawaki explains that he shouldn't be able to, since those are natural flames. Isshiki is combating the flames, but he's shrinking them instead. Amado explains that Sukunahikona can shrink and restore anything but living things, with the exception of the jutsu user, and assures Shikamaru they counted on that happening for them to strike. Jigen's body begins to run out of chakra, so Isshiki can no longer shrink the flames, which begin consuming him. Amado reveals that he was still recovering from the fight against Naruto and Sasuke, which limited how much he could shrink the flames. Naruto wonders if that's Isshiki's end, but Sasuke points out that he still has two K\u0101ma, so he can reincarnate twice. Sasuke also finds it strange, as killing Jigen would make Kawaki Isshiki's sole remaining vessel as he intended. Shikamaru wonders if the entire thing was a setup from the start. Kawaki enters the interrogation room and attacks Amado, but is blocked by Sasuke. Amado assures everyone that it's a misunderstanding, and that he can explain. He says that Jigen's body will perish from the flames in a few minutes, causing the K\u0101ma to automatically begin the reincarnation process, something even Isshiki can't control. He adds that another difference between Jigen and Kawaki is that Jigen's K\u0101ma had time to be fully extracted, so Isshiki can be reincarnated in him, while Kawaki's K\u0101ma has yet to fully decompress, so he can't be a vessel for Isshiki yet. Shikamaru takes it to mean that Isshiki won't be able to return for a while. Boruto asks if Amado intends to kill Kawaki before his K\u0101ma can fully extract, which Amado does confirm is an option, incensing Naruto who refuses to allow it. Amado instructs them to watch the feed so they can witness Isshiki's true form, as even a dead body can be used as a vessel for an \u014ctsutsuki. He notes the fortuitousness of Kawaki's presence, wanting to confirm something for himself. Kawaki's K\u0101ma activates and spreads through his body, and suddenly vanishes. Amado has Boruto confirm that the K\u0101ma on Kawaki's hand has vanished as well. The flames consuming Jigen's body all shrink in an instant. Amado reveals that when an \u014ctsutsuki reincarnates, all of that \u014ctsutsuki's implanted K\u0101ma are erased, something he believes to be a safety feature to avoid the creation of duplicates with the same personality. The others understand that now, without a single implanted K\u0101ma, Isshiki can be permanently killed. Isshiki appears in his true form, and begins shrinking everything in his and Koji's vicinity, including the scout toad, which costs Konoha their video feed. Amado considers his endeavour mostly a success, and that Koji served his function. Naruto gets the feeling Koji was fighting with the intent of fully taking Isshiki out, and is concerned about him for reasons he can't understand. Isshiki says all people have predestined fates, and Koji's mask breaks. He understands that Amado clung to the fate of Jiraiya, which is why he created Koji as his clone, and says his death was also predestined by the same genes.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "215", "Episode Title": "Prepared", "Japanese Airdate": "12 September 2021", "episode synopsis text": "Konoha civilians notice Isshiki floating above them.

Isshiki realises Naruto's power has life-shortening effects, and thinks Naruto has lost his bet, but begins to cough up blood, confused. Kurama explains to Naruto that while Baryon Mode expends their life force, because all chakra is connected, coming in contact with Isshiki during the fight also drains his, cutting his remaining lifespan down to minutes.

Naruto also raises his concern of no longer being able to investigate the dimension is search of Kara's Ten-Tails, but believes it won't pose a threat soon, as the enemy no longer has a suitable sacrifice to cultivate a God Tree. They discuss Code's goals and motives, and agree to put the highest priority on finding him. The other Kage express some apprehension on the fact most of the intel they have comes from Amado. Naruto confesses to not fully trusting him, but finds him reliable enough due to his contributions against Isshiki. The Kage ask Naruto what he'll do if Boruto becomes a threat due to his K\u0101ma, and Gaara points out that with Kurama's loss, Naruto might not be strong enough to take down another \u014ctsutsuki, so he might need to take action before Boruto gets taken over again. Himawari is saddened by Kawaki no longer being able to use Naruto's prosthetic. Sumire visits Kawaki, and takes him to have his arm restored by Amado. Katasuke is impressed by it. Kawaki advises them to beware of Amado. Mitsuki notices Boruto's dejected attitude. Katasuke informs Naruto of the acceleration of Boruto's K\u0101ma progression. Naruto wishes to inform Boruto himself. Amado asks Katasuke on the progress of him becoming a member of the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team. Sarada finds Mitsuki by himself, and he tells her that Boruto is staying awake out of fear of Momoshiki taking him over. Naruto and Sasuke discuss Boruto's K\u0101ma, and Sasuke reveals he promised Boruto he'd take him out if he became a threat. Naruto informs Boruto of his predicament, and comforts him. Boruto can no longer stay awake and falls asleep. Amado approaches Naruto, and offers him a drug he developed to weaken the Byakugan, that might help in preventing Boruto's \u014ctsutsuki progression. He explains that he microdosed Kawaki with it for a long time, so Jigen wouldn't notice, which is why Kawaki's progression took longer. Amado also points out that since Boruto has Byakugan potential, he might experience side effects that Kawaki didn't. He admits that he was concerned about Naruto not being able to take action like before, but also reveals he knows what it is like not wanting to lose a child, having had a daughter who died twelve years prior. Naruto gives Boruto the medication, who begins taking it immediately. Mitsuki and Sarada notice the change in Boruto's attitude, and wonder if they'll be able take missions again. Amado is accepted as part of the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, and gives data for Sumire to compile. Kawaki returns the prosthetic to Naruto, who asks if he wants to become a genin.

Boruto tries building Denki's confidence when he thinks he'll hold back his team-mates during the practical portion of the exam. The written exam results are published, and the advancing teams celebrate. Kaito Kawanami, a senior of Boruto's in the Academy, acts haughty towards him. Boruto doesn't recall who he is, and Denki explains that his team mostly take on overseas missions. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru congratulate them, and explain they want to promote shinobi with varied skills. The exam is also a way to reassure the village following Isshiki's attack. Feeling good about his progress, Boruto buys taiyaki for Kawaki. Naruto checks on Boruto, who has trouble sleeping, thinking back to how he embarrassed himself during the last exam. Naruto reassures him he knows his strengths, telling him to do what he would normally do, and Boruto vows to do his best. The next day, the genin gather for the next exam. Shikadai drops by to motivate his team-mates, reminding them that as ch\u016bnin, their earnings from missions will also increase. The second exam is to be held in the Forest of Death, where battle conditions will be simulated. Individually, the genin must rescue injured subordinates. Upon learning there are only 10 subordinates for 26 genin, one team rushes in before all instructions are given, and are disqualified upon being captured by forest wildlife. There will also be ch\u016bnin in the forest acting as enemy shinobi. Sarada asks about returning with the subordinate within the time limit to advance to the third round, but the genin are surprised to be told there won't be a third round. Kaito acts chummy with Boruto. The exam begins. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru observe their performance through cameras. Tsubaki rescues a subordinate. Namida finds Mirai by a campfire, thinking her to be a subordinate, but she's actually in the role of an enemy shinobi, and knocks Namida unconscious. Team 40 gets trapped in a sand pit. Iwabee and Wasabi argue over who found a subordinate. Mitsuki fends off a ch\u016bnin while carrying his hostage. Team 25 collaborate. Boruto escapes from insects. Denki finds a subordinate, someone much bigger than himself, but remains committed to carrying him off the forest.

Sarada sees through Mirai's Mitsuki disguise and engages in combat. Wasabi and Iwabee succeed in taking their subordinates out of the forest. Kaito lays a trap for Boruto, having placed a transmitter on him before the exam began, and takes his subordinate. However, he gets scared by a bear, and falls off to the side. Boruto's subordinate frees herself and Boruto from Kaito's web, which she assures him is an understandable special circumstance. She warns him he still has time, but Boruto chooses to check on Kaito and bandages his injury. He carries Kaito with a shadow clone, and almost makes it out of the forest with his subordinate before the time limit expires. Tsubaki, H\u014dki, Inojin, Ch\u014dch\u014d, Denki, Wasabi, Iwabee, Sarada, and Mitsuki pass. Boruto also passes, and the proctors explain they were judged on overall performance, so his commitment to not abandoning an injured team-mate counted for his result, as it's not always possible to complete a mission.

They're free to spend the next day training or resting. Denki and Iwabee comfort Metal Lee over not advancing to the final round. Team 7 discuss their motivations for becoming ch\u016bnin, and promise not to hold back if they have to fight each other. The next day, Kawaki passes on training with Boruto and Mitsuki. Metal offers to help Denki and Iwabee train. They go to Katasuke's lab, where according to exam rules, Denki's allowed to use Scientific Ninja Tools of his own creation. He's motivated because this allows him to showcase his skills, even when he's less combat oriented. They discuss which genin they might fight. Denki asks Metal to be his practice opponent, and soundly defeats him. Shikadai takes Inojin and Ch\u014dch\u014d to barbecue. Inojin tries taking over Ch\u014dch\u014d to avoid their bill getting too big, but she overpowers him. They think back to going there since they were babies, and Shikadai offers to handle the bill, and when they're ch\u016bnin, they'll split the bills. Inojin and Ch\u014dch\u014d later discuss that Shikadai was wearing his ch\u016bnin vest under his clothes, as an encouragement for them to earn their own. Sai checks on Team 25, and they focus on his Anbu teachings. Wasabi and Tsubaki train together, but Tsubaki says it's enough for the day, not wanting Wasabi to be exhausted the next day. Tsubaki receives a message from the Land of Iron. She's happy because she's being called back for a leadership position after the exams are over, seeing it as the result of her training with shinobi. Namida and Wasabi are happy for her success, but sad over her imminent departure. Team 5 arrives, and Iwabee and Wasabi begin arguing. Denki tells them to stop, and Tsubaki notices his battered appearance. Denki explains he's been testing a Scientific Ninja Tool in the lab all day.

Himawari calls her brother. At the arena, Konohamaru and Shikamaru discuss its repair since Momoshiki's attack, and the broadcasting of the finals, since each village held its own exam separately. Himawari tells Boruto that she's been practising being shinobi with her friends Eh\u014d and Yuina, and they came across some suspicious individuals. Eh\u014d and Yuina kept tracking them, but she was worried about it. Boruto agrees to check it, having time before the finals begin. Naruto invites Kawaki to watch the finals with him and cheer on Boruto, but he's not interested, so Naruto points out that as a round featuring battles, Kawaki might get to see all sorts of ninjutsu. Konohamaru explains the rules and win conditions of the fights. Sarada is concerned by Boruto's and Mitsuki's absence, but they won't be disqualified if they arrive before their names are drawn for a fight. Inojin Yamanaka and H\u014dki Taketori are the first sorted to fight. Himawari takes Boruto and Mitsuki to meet Eh\u014d and Yuina. The people they're tracking are talking to Amado, and put him on a train, which begins to leave. Boruto and Mitsuki hop on it. Shikadai and Ch\u014dch\u014d discuss H\u014dki with Inojin. Likewise, H\u014dki reviews Inojin's jutsu with Renga and Hako. Boruto and Mitsuki board the train. The first match begins with Inojin attacking with his drawings. H\u014dki counterattacks with an Earth Release, raising columns all over the arena. Iwabee is impressed by it. Inojin is disoriented by the pillars acting like a maze, and Sai explains to Naruto that H\u014dki is going all around it memorising its layout. It allows him to strike from blindspots. H\u014dki recalls Sai explaining that the secretive nature of their missions means they're rarely acknowledged, but that Kakashi was able to become Hokage despite being former Anbu. Inojin decides to fly above the maze, but that allows H\u014dki to strike him with a pillar. As he falls, Inojin sends some birds H\u014dki's way as a distraction to allow him to hide. He's concerned by his earlier chakra expenditure. Inojin decides to use his Mind Body Switch Technique. H\u014dki tries provoking him by suggesting he concede the fight. Inojin doesn't respond, and recalling his previous fights, H\u014dki knows Inojin will try taking him over. Inojin leaves an ink trail to make H\u014dki attack him from a known position, and uses his jutsu. Inside H\u014dki's mind, Inojin is attacked by a construct and is forced out. H\u014dki holds him at kunai point, and Konohamaru declares him the winner. Renga and Hako celebrate. Ch\u014dch\u014d and Shikadai check on Inojin, who wonders what that was. Sai explains it's defensive jutsu against mind-reading, the kind taught to Anbu members in the event they're captured by enemies, to safeguard information. Shikadai and Ch\u014dch\u014d comment on how difficult and dangerous those are, and Renga and Hako arrive, saying that dangerous assignments are commonplace for them. H\u014dki thanks Sai for his training, and helps Inojin up, thanking him for pushing him to give his all. Everyone watching celebrates the good match. After the arena is cleared, the names for the second match are drawn, Iwabee Yuino and Wasabi Izuno. Sarada is concerned by her team-mates still being absent.

His team-mates support him. Wasabi isn't as boisterous, which her team-mates notice and comment on. Wasabi's parents arrive, already celebrating her promotion, flustering her. Wasabi's grandmother joins them, expressing pride in Wasabi representing their clan. She believes that Wasabi becoming ch\u016bnin at her age, a first for their clan, will be a great accomplishment, Wasabi's parents echoing her and confident that Wasabi can become Hokage. Wasabi's grandmother hands her a scroll she left at home, a jutsu passed down their clan that channels a monster cat. Wasabi points out her match is about to begin, and asks them to return to their seats. Wasabi is exasperated after they leave, thinking that the jutsu is something her grandmother dreamed up. She explains that only a few of her clansmen became ch\u016bnin, only after becoming adults themselves, and adds she's never met a j\u014dnin from her clan. Tsubaki is surprised to hear it, but Namida relates to her. Wasabi wants to make her clan proud, but their expectations weight on her. The match begins, Iwabee noticing her low energy, and her finding he can't understand how she feels. Iwabee strikes first, attempting to crush her, but she dodges him, activates her jutsu, and counterattacks. Sarada and Ch\u014dch\u014d are joined in the stands by Shinki, Araya, and Yodo, who were told by Gaara to come watch. They confirm they've been ch\u016bnin for a while, and comment the Konoha genin are taking their time in doing the same. Shinki notices Kawaki yawning at the stands. Iwabee notices Wasabi's parents cheering on her, which embarrasses her, and she confesses that while she wants to be a great shinobi, becoming Hokage isn't her goal, just something her family assumed and expects of her. That angers Iwabee, who holds the Hokage in the highest regard. Wasabi tells him that for ordinary shinobi like them, becoming Hokage is an unrealistic fantasy. She realises she's yelling and that her family heard her, her mother covering her grandmother's ears. Iwabee notices she dropped a scroll, and she explains the supposed jutsu, though she doubts it's legitimate. She recalls her grandmother telling her about the jutsu, each time aggrandising it. She believes that if such a jutsu existed, she could never use it because of the limits of what she can do. Iwabee agrees with her, find her so afraid of other's expectations she doesn't dare to dream big. He asks if she'll dream big if she sees a cat as big as a mountain, like her grandmother told her, and uses his Earth Release to create one. He tells her she can't do it because she already believes it's impossible. He collapses from using too much chakra, and the head of the cat he created breaks off, threatening to crush him. Wasabi successfully uses her clan's jutsu to destroy the cat head and protect Iwabee. Her family is moved by her use of the jutsu. Konohamaru declares to match over, pointing out Iwabee can no longer stand. Wasabi wants a proper victory, but Iwabee himself says he can no longer fight. Naruto comments on how unusual the match was, and Shikamaru comments it reminds him of Naruto and Kiba. Wasabi's family cries of joy. Boruto and Mitsuki discover where Amado and his captors are.

Shinki pulls him off with his Iron Sand and reiterates he should watch the match before going back inside. The match between Sarada and Ch\u014dch\u014d begins. Ch\u014dch\u014d tries landing blows with enlarged fists, while Sarada dodges and reads her movements with her Sharingan. Positioning herself on a wall, Sarada attacks with Lightning Balls, landing hits. She's apologetic about it, which angers Ch\u014dch\u014d, who calls Sarada out for not going all out against her and lands a hit.

Naruto is interested in the pitting of samurai against science. Denki's confidence makes an impression in Tsubaki. She makes the first move, but Denki's power suit allows him to quickly analyse her movements and react accordingly. He uses a pseudo Lightning Release they recognise from the previous Ch\u016bnin Exam with his suit. Katasuke excitedly explains that Denki's suit uses Lightning Release to stimulate his reflexes. Mitsuki asks if he feels embarrassed considering the previous exam. Iwabee recalls that the person Denki least wanted to fight was Tsubaki, over his limited data on how samurai fight as opposed to shinobi. Still, he remained confident. Denki goes on the offensive, so Tsubaki dodges a heavy blow that surprises everyone. She acknowledges his power, and apologises for underestimating him. Tsubaki recalls overhearing Namida and Wasabi before the exams, how they didn't want her to go back home, but deciding to cheer on her for bringing pride to her people back in the Land of Iron. Tsubaki and some of the spectators notice that Denki's attacks are getting more precise. Denki manages to land hits and throws Tsubaki up in the air, where he aims a fireball at her. She slices through it, and back on the ground, she manages to land an attack made in desperation. Tsubaki wants to test something, and begins attacking Denki not only with her sword, but also her sword's sheath. She's able to destroy Denki's visor. Katasuke explains the visor contained a motion sensor to help Denki predict her movements, which Sarada compares to the Sharingan. The rest of Denki's suit begins to overheat. Tsubaki commends him on what he's achieved so far, but he refuses to give up. He dodges her attack, allowing her to destroy his suit, which surprises her. Denki enhances his movements with the Lightning Release from earlier on his own, and uses the last of his chakra to land an attack on Tsubaki.

Sai and Shikamaru discuss it with Naruto, and find it strange that Mirai and Konohamaru couldn't handle the situation by themselves.

Boruto notices that the villagers seem to be cooperating with the bandits, and Mitsuki wonders if they're all hostages. Konohamaru is questioned about Konoha's sensing system, but divulges nothing.

Despite finding it premature, he decides to act, but Boruto arrives transformed as a woman, claiming to be a lost traveller. Hy\u014dgo\u200e doubts it, as the village is away from everything, so no one arrives there on their way to somewhere else.

Konohamaru frees himself, and Team 7 informs him they've done all he planned to do using the fog as cover, including freeing the many hostages. Hy\u014dgo\u200e tries using the fog to cover his escape, but Mitsuki's snake informs him of his direction, so Boruto and Sarada throw Konohamaru, who lands a Rasengan on him.

Kurobane leaves after saying Mozuku's package is the last, and confirms having killed the others. Mozuku touches one of Jujumaru's blood threads, which forces him to hurt himself. Shikadai knocks him out to stop him. Kawaki destroys the threads with an energy blast, but they regenerate. Shikadai takes a moment to think, and asks Ch\u014dch\u014d to go through the threads, destroying many of them. He determined how fast they can regenerate. Jujumaru has Ch\u014dch\u014d prepare to attack, but she turns around and attacks him instead, Shikadai having taken control of her with his shadow. He and Kawaki fight Jujumaru while Ch\u014dch\u014d gets injured protecting Mozuku. They defeat and restrain him, while Mozuku treats Ch\u014dch\u014d. Shikadai tells Mozuku to explain himself. Mozuku reveals there's an epidemic in the Land of Calms Seas, but the daimy\u014d has a monopoly on the treatment, and the high price prevents most citizens from affording it. Mozuku's master is a medical-nin who served the daimy\u014d and developed a more affordable treatment, but was discovered, so he and his students were targeted. He sent his students with money abroad to further develop a cure with colleagues, which is why Mozuku is so frugal with money. The daimy\u014d is trying to acquire their cure to monetise it. Mozuku begs them to recover the medicine, and explains that if he had been upfront about his request, he wouldn't have been able to afford the mission with the little money he has left. Shikadai wants to be back to Konoha for safety, but Kawaki defies him and goes with Mozuku.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "230", "Episode Title": "A_Wish", "Japanese Airdate": "26 December 2021", "episode synopsis text": "Mozuku leads Kawaki through the shortest route to the Land of Calm Seas, hoping to intercept Kurobane, who he reveals in an Anbu in service of the daimy\u014d. He apologises for splitting his team, but Kawaki explains they were never his team. Shikadai takes an injured Ch\u014dch\u014d back to Konoha. Konohamaru updates Naruto and Shikamaru that all the recently murdered boys were from the Land of Calm Seas. Believing it to be related, Naruto orders reinforcements, recalling that Team 7 is also out on a mission. Finishing the mission, Mitsuki receives the order, recalling that Boruto's intuition was right. Shikadai stops to let Ch\u014dch\u014d rest, and they're approached by Boruto and Sarada, who decided to check on them after seeing the suspicious shinobi around the same area of their mission. Shikadai tells Boruto that Kawaki left with the client. Kawaki and Mozuku catch up to Kurobane. Mozuku tries appealing to him as a Land of Calm Seas citizen, but Kurobane thinks a shinobi should do only as ordered by their employer. He casts a fog from which several clones appear. When Kawaki's attacks go through them, Mozuku believes they might be genjutsu, but is unable to break through it. Kurobane explains the fog is created from ambient moisture, including their own body moisture, which will leave them as dried husks. Kawaki is hit by a real blade, which he has to dodge as he continues to dry up. He determines that since the real sword is moving unnaturally, the real Kurobane must be controlling it nearby. He disperses some of the fog with a Fire Release, revealing blood threads, which he uses to aim an energy blast at the real Kurobane. He dodges it, but is hit by Kawaki, clearing the fog. Kawaki collects the medicine package, but Kurobane recalls his blade with blood threads. Mozuku protects him with his own body, and tells Kawaki he's the only one who can get it back. Kurobane sends his blade at Kawaki again, but Boruto arrives, breaking it with a Rasengan. He attempts to escape, but is stopped by Shikadai. Kawaki pummels Kurobane and checks on Mozuku. He asks Kawaki to deliver the medicine to his nation in his stead, his sensei being in a nearby checkpoint. He gives him his money, his thanks, and dies. Kawaki takes the medicine, Boruto and Shikadai go with him. They come across more pursuers, so the two stay behind to deal with them while Kawaki goes on ahead. Kawaki reaches the checkpoint, and Mozuku's sensei asks about him, recognising the package. An enemy appears and holds a kunai to him, asking for the package. Kawaki hands him the empty box and defeats him, giving its actual contents to Mozuku's sensei. He mourns Mozuku's death and Kawaki informs him Mozuku's body is in the forest. He thanks Kawaki and leaves. Boruto and Shikadai arrive, and three go back to Konoha as it begins to rain. Kawaki blames his disobedience for Mozuku's death, thinking himself unfit for being a shinobi, despite Shikadai pointing out there are always unforeseen circumstances. Kawaki passes out. Back in Konoha, while they can't directly intervene with the Land of Calm Seas daimy\u014d, they can organise aid relief with the medical-nin. Boruto informs Naruto that Kawaki and Ch\u014dch\u014d are doing better. Sarada visits Ch\u014dch\u014d, and tells her how Kawaki is doing. Boruto and Mitsuki visit him, bringing him a bag full of taiyaki, and are concerned about him after they leave. Kawaki leaves the hospital and runs into Shikadai, who takes him to the Konoha Cemetery. He shows his grandfather's grave, and tells how everyone there died for the village. Shikadai explains that as team-mates, they share the joys, sorrows, pain together, and that as team captain, the mission was his responsibility. They have to move forward because they're alive. Later, Naruto checks on Kawaki, who wants to keep trying at being shinobi no matter how long it takes. Naruto tells him that based on Shikadai's report, despite his issues, he can carry out missions as a genin, so he won't take another exam because he passed. He'll accompany Naruto on missions. He points out that Mozuku gave his life for his country, and asks what is a shinobi exactly. Naruto says he'll have to work out that answer himself. Kawaki is committed to never make the same mistake again and get stronger.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "231", "Episode Title": "The_Rusty_Sword", "Japanese Airdate": "9 January 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Tsubaki dreams of training with Sazanka back in the Land of Iron. She wakes up wondering why she dreamed about that. Team 15 visits a merchant who was attacked by bandits in the hospital. He becomes distressed when hearing Tsubaki handle her sword, yelling that samurai are coming after him again. A nurse asks them to leave, and knowing that his assailant was a samurai, they start to investigate where he was attacked. They noticed cut bamboo, which Tsubaki determines was done by a skilled samurai. She recalls Sazanka's skill, and that the rumoured prize of a tournament was the right to claim Mifune's sword Kurosawa when he retires. Sazanka developed his skills to be worthy of wielding it one day. She recognises Sazanka's cut in the bamboo. Later at the Lightning Burger, Wasabi informs them there was another attack while they were investigating. Tsubaki shares her suspicion of who the culprit is. She reveals Sazanka was a genius of the sword, but abandoned the path he was on to pursue only strength, and was caught trying to steal Kurosawa, and killed his fellow disciples to get away. Tsubaki assures them she will have no problem fighting him, and practises at night. The next day, Team 15 lays a trap, attracting the bandits' attention. Most of them get caught, but they hired Sazanka as protection. Tsubaki comments on how he's changed. He says he forgot to kill her. Sazanka draws his sword, and cuts Tsubaki, who hasn't drawn hers. He dodges Namida's attack, and Team 15 retreats. Wasabi treats Tsubaki, asking why she didn't draw her sword. She asks to be dropped from the mission, and reveals she blames herself for why Sazanka turned out the way he did. She won the tournament by chance, and that started to change him to who he is today. Wasabi tells her they might capture him if they ask for reinforcements but warns her that her regret will continue to grow if she doesn't deal with Sazanka herself. Namida and Wasabi point out how she has grown and changed since coming to Konoha, restoring her fighting spirit. Sazanka tells the bandits there's something more important than money he has to do. Team 15 attacks them, Tsubaki going to deal with Sazanka. Sazanka believes that a sword's purpose is to cut, so he has cut many people since the Land of Iron has pursued him and deems that whatever Tsubaki has done since isn't real training. He says he has given up on Kurosawa because he has acquired power, and charges at her. They cross swords, and noticing there are no openings in his attack, she performs her Secret Sword: Snowstorm Beheading. He cuts through it. He recalls when she won against him, and now wants her to admit defeat. She refuses, and refutes his claims against her, saying she has gained strength from the friends who trust her. They cross swords again, and Tsubaki cuts him down. She is saddened by having to do it in these circumstances. Sazanka acknowledges her strength. Later, Wasabi and Namida help her around.

It's a B-rank mission, which Shikamaru explains is due to the likelihood of someone trying to steal the latest model puppets. At the Lightning Burger, Metal Lee and Iwabee wonder what their next mission will be, and complain to Team 7 they never get anything interesting. Denki arrives, and shocks them with news of their mission. They receive mission details from Katasuke, who explains that Dot\u014d Island, previously a fishing village, has discovered gold deposits. However, excavation is dangerous due to soft soil, so they'll be transporting autonomous puppets for the job. Katasuke wants Denki to run adjustment tests before he and other researchers arrive, as most of them are more analysts than maintenance focused. He spends the rest of the day explaining to Denki how the puppets work. Denki asks Katasuke what was the most difficult part of the development process. Katasuke answers that all of it was difficult, as there were several points where he wished to scrap everything and start over, stressing the importance of adapting to changes as they arise. He reveals that he requested Denki's team for this mission because of what he saw during the Ch\u016bnin Exams. The next day, Iwabee notices Denki is sleepy before they depart. They take a train and two boats to reach Dot\u014d Island, and hear that many people are coming over since the gold was discovered. As they arrive, Metal and Iwabee notice Denki is nervous, and encourage him. They're received by \u014cnami, head of the excavation site. He is rather disappointed by Denki and Team 5, and Denki explains he's been trained in fine-tuning the puppets, and that the developers will join them later. One the trail to the mine's entrance, Denki begins to lag behind, so they stop to rest. \u014cnami questions if Denki really is a shinobi, but is unable to even lift the casing he was carrying. They arrive by sunset, and \u014cnami explains their two-shift security system. At the mine, \u014cnami shows the workers the puppets as Team 5 sets them up. Denki makes a demonstration, impressing the workers. Two of them exchange looks. \u014cnami comes around to Denki, and Team 5 finishes setting the puppets up. The two workers get gold they had hidden, and take \u014cnami hostage against retaliation. They push \u014cnami on top of Metal, and Denki has to stop Iwabee from using Earth Release in the mine, which could cause a collapse. The thieves manage to escape and lock the mine, which will remain closed until the next shift, and shut off the ventilation system. Denki analyses the data he has on the mine, and finds a spot where they can dig with the puppets without causing a collapse. They escape, and use the puppets to locate the gold with the thieves. They find them attempting to escape by boat. One of them attacks with Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique, which Iwabee blocks with Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall. Some of the water hits the puppets, and Iwabee tells to put them away now that they have done their job. Recalling Katasuke's words, Denki adapts the puppets and uses them to catch the thieves' boat, allowing Iwabee to damage its engine. Iwabee and Metal knock the thieves out. The next day, \u014cnami thanks Team 5, and apologises for underestimating Denki. The other researchers arrive. Metal is impressed that Denki knew so much about the mines, and he reveals the reason he was so sleepy and nervous before was because he was studying its complex structure on the way. Iwabee believes their mission was a success, but Denki points out that with the researchers present, there's more for them to do.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "233", "Episode Title": "The_New_Team_7_Jumps_Into_Action", "Japanese Airdate": "23 January 2022", "episode synopsis text": "At night, Isari sails to Kirigakure with a fleet.

In Konoha, Kawaki is officially placed into Team 7. Their first mission together is to escort Katasuke to Kirigakure for the unveiling of their new power system. They're also ordered to covertly investigate a potential terrorist threat during the ceremony. On the train to get to their ship, Kawaki is mesmerised by the ocean, seeing it for the first time. He feels less so on the boat, getting seasick. Kawaki goes to rest inside. The rest of Team 7 reminisces about their previous visit to Kirigakure. Mitsuki asks for details about the ceremony Katasuke will attend. He explains that the Land of Water's recent growth can be traced to advancements to their energy grid. Katasuke is among several foreign technical experts invited to the opening of their newest power plant. Kawaki is still seasick when they arrive, so they tell him to rest. Sarada recalls Team 5 is also on a mission in the Land of Water, and Katasuke informs them of the details, and that he'll join them after the ceremony. They noticed the increased security, owing to the terrorist threat, and get exasperated by Katasuke constantly getting distracted and slipping away to check on electronic goods. This causes them to be late for the start of the ceremony, where only Katasuke is allowed inside.

A guard informs him that Kagura now reports directly to the Mizukage, but chose to act as a prison warden. At the prison, among the prisoners he oversees are Buntan and Hebiichigo. After his speech, the orator tells his son Awaji he'll inherit it all one day. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d announces everyone will be flown to see the Shinonome 1 up close. Boruto rejoins the group, updating them on Kagura. Katasuke allows Boruto to go visit Kagura under the pretence of wanting to inspect it, since they'll have to depart once they're back from the Shinonome 1. Feeling better, Kawaki joins them and tells Boruto to hurry up. At the prison, Boruto is searched before getting inside, and meets up with Kagura. He tells Boruto that some of the swordsmen from their previous encounter are being held in the prison, but Shizuma escaped and killed the previous warden. Hassaku and Ichir\u014dta, who helped him, were caught and moved to a different prison. He trusts that Kyoh\u014d, Hebiichigo, and Buntan didn't try to escape, and took over as warden because he believes that to grow Kirigakure, they need to nurture the people. Boruto praises the Land of Water's economic growth, and Kagura explains that some disagree with the daimy\u014d's decisions. Boruto compares the complexity of the situation to his evolving stance on scientific ninja tools. Kagura shows Boruto around, including the highest security cells. Araumi Funato, head of a pirate clan, is suspended off the ground. His clan has plundered the opens seas of the Land of Water for years, and abducted many people.

Taiki manages to bribe them, but Kawaki exposes them by getting out in the open, feeling so sick he needed fresh air. They throw the Funato clansmen into the water, and Taiki speeds up the boat to flee from them, but only for a short while, so the engine doesn't die. Kawaki apologises for exposing them, and tensions rise between Team 7 and the swordsmen. Mitsuki advocates against causing a ruckus in such a small boat. Kagura assures Team 7 the swordsmen can't betray them, and shows the cursed seals on their necks. Buntan assures Sarada they're taking this mission seriously as a way to shorten their sentences, and if they wanted to do anything, it wouldn't be in front of Kagura. They come across a destroyed island where villagers stood up to the Funato. Kagura explains how the Funato's influence grew when Araumi took over leadership of the clan, and targeted trade routes between the Land of Water and other nations, depriving them of wealth. Five years prior, Araumi was captured in an operation which Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d himself took part in, so without its leader, the Funato's influence receded. Boruto thinks they're scum, but Kawaki points out even scum has reasons for what they do. Dot\u014d Island comes into view. The Funato clansmen on the island control the people. Boruto wants to find Team 5, but Kagura agrees that Sarada and Mitsuki would be better scouts, with the Sharingan and snakes. Sarada wants Boruto to stay on the boat, watching the swordsmen. Kawaki reminds them that Konoha researchers are also in the island, so they'll need another boat. They arrange to meet before the full moon.

They use it as bait in a trap and manage to reset the puppet. It leads them to Team 5, Denki still having the puppets' controller. They inform Sarada and Mitsuki the researchers have been captured. In Taiki's boat, the swordsmen antagonise Boruto, suggesting his team-mates have been eaten by sharks. Kagura reveals to Boruto the reason he's trusting the swordsmen is because he helped him when Shizuma had lead him astray. He wants to save them, like Boruto saved him.

Team 5 shows Mitsuki and Sarada how the Funato have organised at Dot\u014d Island, and where they're holding the islanders hostage.

One of the Funato leaders receives word they found where the Konoha shinobi were hiding, and promises a gold nugget to whoever can find them.

Boruto talks Iwabee down, pointing out how distressed Kyoh\u014d is, and Buntan talks Hebiichigo down, reasoning that she shouldn't provoke Iwabee is she wants him to stand down. They decide to keep quiet about Taiki's murder, and wonder about the culprit. Hebiichigo suggests they already escaped the ship, but Denki says that with the thick fog, even the Funato wouldn't risk it without a ship, which they would have heard. They decide to investigate the ship for a hidden culprit, while Iwabee and Boruto keep an eye on Kyoh\u014d, Boruto feeling guilty that Taiki got involved despite being a bystander. Everyone else splits in teams of two. Word of Taiki's murder spreads through the refugees, who become concerned by the presence of the swordsmen on the ship. Metal Lee asks Hebiichigo if she believes in Kyoh\u014d's innocence. She doesn't want to be guilty by association and lose her sentence reduction. She also believes him because they did time together. Metal is convinced, his trusting nature confusing Hebiichigo. Boruto thinks Iwabee doesn't really believe Kyoh\u014d is guilty, and recalls that Iwabee's grandfather died fighting Kirigakure. Iwabee is surprised Boruto remembers it. Boruto thinks they should trust Kyoh\u014d and the swordsmen because Kagura trusts them. The shinobi find no sign of a hidden culprit, but Denki brings one of the refugees, who wishes to speak with them. They go to Boruto, Iwabee, and Kyoh\u014d, telling them a refugee came forward with damning testimony, and they ask for Kyoh\u014d to unmask himself. The refugee claims he saw Kyoh\u014d on his way to the captains quarters when he went to the bathroom. They want to see if Kyoh\u014d has the same face marks as the Funato. Kyoh\u014d is very anxious about unmasking. Even his team-mates have never seen Kyoh\u014d unmasked. The refugees recall Kyoh\u014d of being surrounded by the Funato, causing him to run in fear, which they take as proof of Kyoh\u014d's guilt. Kawaki tells Boruto it's a drastic measure they have to take. Kyoh\u014d ambushes Iwabee, but is saved by Kawaki, who prepares to execute Kyoh\u014d. Kawaki tells the refugees he dealt with Kyoh\u014d, and the shinobi deal with Kyoh\u014d's body. As the night rolls in, so does thick fog again. One of the refugees checks on Kyoh\u014d's body, puking a lot of water, which reforms into Kobanza, who stole Kabutowari while Kyoh\u014d was sleeping. He intends to take control of Kyoh\u014d's body. Kyoh\u014d reveals himself to be alive, catching the Funato in Kawaki's trap. Kawaki thought that news of Taiki's murder spread too quickly, and the fake testimony sealed the deal, as the bathroom and captain quarters are in opposite directions. Kobanza turns into water again, which Mitsuki compares to Suigetsu. He and Boruto attack with Lightning Release kunai, forcing him to escape through cracks on the wall. He tries to take out the engine, but Hebiichigo holds him in place with Nuibari, its wires capable of binding chakra itself, so the Funato clansmen can't escape even with a liquid body. Boruto, Kagura, and Buntan catch up, Buntan ready to make him talk. The clansmen forces himself free of the wires, and goes into the engine, killing himself to damage it. Kyoh\u014d protects Hebiichigo from the explosion. The next day, the refugees feel bad about distrusting Kyoh\u014d. Metal wonders why Kyoh\u014d wears a mask, and he explains that long ago, his village was burned by the Funato, so he wears a mask to hide the scars, the sight of blood taking him back to that moment. Iwabee apologises for suspecting Kyoh\u014d, who in turn apologises for taking so long to explain himself. Mitsuki takes an interest on Kawaki.

Kagura believes they'll have to use a lifeboat to request aid at the nearest island. Boruto suffers from heatstroke and falls into the ocean, where he is saved by a figure with webbed fingers. When he comes to, Iwabee tells him he merely passed out from heatstroke on the ship. Another ship approaches them, the boy on the ship reminding Boruto of the figure he saw. Boruto asks the boy if he's the one who dove after him. The boy is flustered, and the other man tells him the boy was with him the whole time. Boruto remains certain he fell in the ocean, despite everyone else saying otherwise. Kagura recognises the man as Kajiki, a prominent shipbuilder from an island north of Kirigakure. The boy boasts Kajiki is the best shipbuilder in the whole Land of Water, and is reprimanded by Kajiki. The boy introduces himself as Ikada, Kajiki's apprentice, and notes most of them are Konoha shinobi. Kagura explains their situation, and deciding he can't fix the ship there, Kajiki has Ikada prepare for their ship to tow the damaged one. They reach the shipbuilders' island, and Ikada offers to show them around. Boruto recalls that whoever saved him had webbed hands, but Ikada shows his aren't, so Boruto apologises. The Dot\u014d Island refugees are allowed to stay, and Kagura requests a ship to get back to Kirigakure, but they all left to fight the Funato. Kajiki says he can repair their ship, but will require payment, and asks help from Team 5, Boruto also offers to help. Kagura, Sarada, and the swordsmen want to contact the Mizukage, Mitsuki and Kawaki will stay by the harbour. At a Funato controlled island, Araumi receives reports from his children, updating him on their military strength. Tenma arrives, and notifies them of the loss of their mobile fortress and those responsible. Isari recalls that Kagura was the warden of Araumi's prison, and fighting a Konoha shinobi during the breakout. Araumi and Isari both tell Tenma not to worry, as the fortress did its purpose, and was just a tool, all that matters is defeating their enemies at the end. Kajiki determines what needs to be fixed and updated in the stolen Funato ship, and Denki requests learning more about the engine if something happens again. Boruto returns Ikada's idea notebook when he drops it. The overhear the other craftsmen discussing the Funato, some of them understanding their reservations about the daimy\u014d, and sharing rumours that the Shinonome 1 would case trouble for fishermen by messing with the currents. Ikada explains that the Fourth Mizukage unified previously independent islands, explaining their lack of unity. Kagura manages to contact Misuno, who reports that Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d left for the front-lines, and suspects he'll order Kagura to do the same soon. Misuno is leaving to join Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d. Buntan complains about their situation. Kawaki is bothered by Mitsuki following him. Kajiki chides Ikada for letting an important engine part to go out of stock, and is unwilling to let him go get more because of Funato activity. Boruto offers to guard Funato while he retrieves the missing part. Kajiki allows it, so Ikada and Boruto depart on a small ship made by Ikada. It's the first ship he's made, his dream being to travel the world in a ship of his making.

Ikada warns him they're about to enter more turbulent, stormy waters. Boruto compliments Ikada on his skills, and Ikada reveals he was born on the sea and lived on a boat since he was little. He explains that he came to the shipbuilders' island on his own, just wishing to do something with boats, until he met Kajiki and decided to become his apprentice. Boruto asks if this means he's living away from his family, and apologises for inquiring too much. Ikada says a lot happened when he left, and he only stayed in contact with his older sister, who was the only one who supported his decision. Boruto mentions Himawari, and the two bond over how scary angry sisters can be. Sarada finds Mitsuki walking around, and informs him she's learned some more about the Funato and that Kagura is busy with refugee related paperwork. Mitsuki reveals his recent interest in Kawaki, puzzling her. Team 5 and the shipbuilders get along. Sarada and Mitsuki arrive, and update them on recent developments. Iwabee wants to evacuate the researchers as soon as possible. They tell Sarada and Mitsuki about Boruto's and Ikada's run for the replacement engine part. They're concerned about the rough waters and the fact they went on Ikada's first boat, but Kajiki is confident they'll be ok despite the work needed on his technical skills because Ikada put his soul on his boat. On rough waters, Boruto spots a capsized boat, wanting to help. Ikada is against it, not wanting to risk their lives, but relents when Boruto points out there's someone on the boat. Ikada reads the waves and the wind to avoid whirlpools, but they lose sight of the person on the boat. Boruto prepares to dive after them, but Ikada goes instead. Boruto notices webs on his hands as he swims. Ikada saves the man, and Boruto asks about his webs. Ikada confesses the webs appear whenever he puts effort in swimming, confirming he's the one who saved Boruto. He keeps them hidden so as not to startle strangers. Boruto doesn't find them that odd, knowing many peculiar persons himself. Ikada says no one else knows about it, and asks Boruto to keep it a secret, which he agrees. A wave knocks Ikada off the boat, but Boruto pulls him back with shadow clones, reminding him of his dream. As Ikada navigates, Boruto pushes driftwood away with Wind Release: Gale Palm. They reach their destination by sundown, and the man they rescued is taken to be treated. Ikada believes they were lucky, but Boruto credits him and his boat. He notices how different the sea is, and Ikada explains it's a great fishing spot. Boruto asks if the people protesting against the Shinonome 1 are concerned about the fish disappearing because of it. Ikada doesn't know. He reveals he didn't feel like he belonged at home, and came up with his interest in boats as a reason to leave. Being taken in by Kajiki helped him realise things about himself, he wants to build a ship to connect with people, just as ships connects separate islands. They rush to get to the factory before it closes. Isari reports to Araumi about the Mizukage's fleet. Tenma looks forward to war. Araumi confirms Seiren is ready for her role.

Boruto and Ikada eat together at sunset, and Ikada talks what he has yet to learn to fulfil his dream. At night, the swordsmen discuss the prospect of their reduced sentences. In the morning, Seiren disguises herself and visits Ikada. She wants him to go back, but he claims there's nothing he can do. She refutes it by saying he has the power everyone in the Funato clan possesses. They think back to when their father held a ceremony to determine Ikada's powers. Ikada was scared, and Tenma thought little of him. Araumi threw Ikada at the stormy sea, and the sea threw him back on land. Seiren says he displayed more power than anyone in their clan, and that Araumi acknowledged him. Ikada claims no memory of displaying any sort of power, and that he left after Araumi was imprisoned so he could become useful to their clan. He points out she reasoned with everyone, allowing him to leave, but she reveals she did so he'd witness how corrupt the Land of Water had become, and come back on his own. She says he has power as a Funato, and should use it for the Funato. Ikada refuses, wishing to follow his own dream. She asks if he knows what their clan has been through, and says she'll come back from him at night. Boruto comes to see Ikada, and Seiren notices his Konoha forehead protector, recalling Tenma's testimony of their interference with their plans. She finds it a good opportunity to show what happens to their enemies. Kagura checks on Kawaki, and tells him he wants to be for the swordsmen who Boruto was to him. Sarada arrives with a message for Kagura. Hebiichigo overhears their sentences have only been reduced by three years, and leaves before hearing Kagura plans to appeal on their behalf. She informs Kyoh\u014d and Buntan, and plans to runaway. Buntan points out their juinjutsu, and Hebiichigo decides to neutralise it by killing Kagura. Buntan and Kyoh\u014d are still uninterested, pointing out they'd be on the run for the rest of their lives, and would likely be captured again. She tells Hebiichigo to run away by herself if she's so interested. Seiren returns to her ship at sundown, and prepares for a night attack, wishing for a single survivor to tell of the power of the Funato.

Isari and Jibiki discuss how they're luring Kirigakure into a trap. Boruto and Iwabee join Kagura, Sarada, and Denki, who are going over the coded message they discovered. Iwabee's comment on origami gives Kagura an idea on how to fold the paper, allowing him to decode the message. Everyone gathers, and Kagura explains the sea battle is a distraction, while an elite Funato force makes a sneak attack on Kirigakure, even making their way there by land instead of sea to avoid drawing attention. Even if Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d turns back now, he won't make it back in time to protect the skeleton crew on Kirigakure. Boruto wants them to go to Kirigakure, but Kagura is unwilling to allow it, as this is a war, and they no longer have the pretext of getting Team 5 and the Konoha researchers to safety. Sarada agrees with Boruto. Kagura asks for the swordsmen's help, but unsatisfied with just a three year sentence reduction for what they've done so far, they ask for a complete acquittal, which Kagura agrees to, intending to negotiate it with Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d personally. As the elite Funato force is making their way through mountainous terrain, Kagura knows a village they'll have to pass through, and plans to intercept them there. They arrange for the refugees to be evacuated, and coordinate messages warning Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d about the sneak attack, and Naruto about the developments from their mission. Boruto goes to the dock to check on Ikada, but Kajiki tells him he hasn't seen Ikada since the night before. He doesn't believe that Ikada was kidnapped, and knows he wouldn't abandon his shipbuilding training. Boruto checks Ikada's home, and finds out he even left his idea journal behind. Kagura's group arrives at the village, where two villagers recognise him, as that's where he grew up. He explains the situation to the village, and asks them help in fortifying it to protect themselves from the Funato when they pass through. Sarada and Buntan make note of a ravine and bridges they saw on the way to the village, and want to force the Funato into the ravine by taking down the bridges. Kagura has Team 7, Buntan, and Kyoh\u014d fortify the village's defences, while Team 5 and Hebiichigo destroy the bridges. The small children in the village take a liking to Kawaki. Metal Lee gets embarrassed when his suit rips while destroying a bridge, exposing his underwear. Hebiichigo sews it, and shares her concerns about facing the Funato. Metal's positive attitude puzzles her. Boruto updates Kagura on the fortification's progress, and asks him about his past. Kagura explains that because of the stigma of being Yagura's grandson, they couldn't guarantee his safety in Kirigakure, so they moved him to this village. Boruto is appalled by it. Kagura has good memories of making friends beneath the tree where he practised kenjutsu, despite them knowing who he was. Kagura's old friends also befriend Kyoh\u014d as he chops down trees for fortifications. Kagura confides his hopes for the village to Boruto. The Funato make their way through the mountains.

She overhears the Funato scouts talking about discovering Kagura's ambush and Funamushi's plan to counter it. She feels conflicted between staying on her way, or returning to warn them about it and risk getting involved in the battle. The Funato forces arrive at the ravine, but their scouts trigger traps early, wasting them. The Funato attack Kagura and Team 7. Funamushi receives the report about it, and commands his forces to advance while their enemies are distracted. Hebiichigo arrives just in time to protect Kagura from an attack, having informed Buntan and Kyoh\u014d, who arrive with her. Kagura decides they have to defeat Funamushi and retreat while the Funato are disoriented by it. Funamushi grows impatient at how long his forces are taking to advance, and joins the battle himself, becoming elated when he notices Kagura, seeing it as an opportunity for payback over Seiren's defeat. He attacks them with a large scale Water Release, creating and controlling a waterspout. The attack is blocked by a landslide caused by Team 5, who was notified of the emergency by a snake sent by Mitsuki. Hebiichigo is embarrassed when Metal is happy about her return. With the ravine passage blocked, they'll have to face the Funato at the village. A Funato advises Funamushi not to pursue them, as they'll have the advantage at the village with fortified defences, but Funamushi wants to avenge Seiren.

He believes it's worth it to avenge Seiren, who he claims will never stand again. The other Funato imprison Kyoh\u014d, Metal, and Iwabee with water, putting them on the way of Funamushi's attack, which destroys parts of the village. Kagura channels his chakra into Hiramekarei, enlarging it enough to cut through Funamushi's attack.

Iwabee reports that the food storage was destroyed, so there's very little food left. Sarada weights their options. Denki suggests foraging for food on the chance Funamushi avoids the village to continue with the Kirigakure ambush, which would allow them to know if the Funato pass them by, and return quickly if necessary. Sarada agrees to let Team 5 do it. Mitsuki volunteers for locating the Funato, being able to use his snakes to cover a large area. Sarada wants everyone else to help fortify the village for the next attack.

Araumi asks for the circumstances and notes how composed Isari is. Isari confesses to feeling bitter and frustrated, but the situation requires him to stay steady, and notes that with the failed diversion, their ambush is more likely to fail as well. Araumi comments that Tenma's death and Seiren's defeat are consequences of his plan as well. He is confident that Seiren will recover, and wants her to head their assault unit so she can get revenge on the ones who defeated her, certain it's the ones they fought at the prison. Isari wants to carry on with the ambush, but Araumi decides to take leadership, even if it means ignoring Isari's plans. Isari wanted to go with ambushes because he's aware of the difference in strength between the Funato and Kirigakure, but Araumi states that as a clan of the sea, that is unlike them, so they'll fight head on. Araumi sends word to call off Funamushi's ambush, and considers it a mistake leaving Isari in charge as recognition for his role in freeing him from prison. Team 5's foraging doesn't amount to much, and with trading diminished because of the conflict, the village has to ration food. Kawaki informs them the villagers are foregoing eating for their sake, who feel the village will collapse entirely without them.

Metal is more nervous than usual, as winning this fight is necessary to see his team-mates again. Hebiichigo thinks back to Kagura, and shares that the reason she has survived so many battles is because during them, she fought thinking only of herself. At sundown, the Funato still haven't attacked. Kawaki wonders if they're trying to starve them out after learning their situation from Denki and Iwabee searching for food. Boruto doesn't think that's the case, recalling that Funamushi went straight for Kagura because he was avenging Seiren, and believes Funamushi is waiting for something.

Gokai points out their dwindled numbers, and Funamushi's still healing body. Funamushi wants to attack soon before Araumi forces their withdrawal, as he won't have another chance to avenge Seiren. The Funato begin to mobilise, and Sarada orders the swordsmen and Metal to engage them. Sarada is leaving Funamushi to Boruto and Kawaki, since Boruto is his main target. Despite their diminished numbers, the remaining Funato are fighting harder, even sacrificing themselves to hold them in place for attacks. Funamushi arrives and attacks. Kawaki protects Boruto. Funamushi taunts Boruto, claiming Denki and Iwabee died begging for their lives. Boruto notices the Funato bringing Funamushi water barrels for his jutsu, which confirms his suspicion. He attacks Funamushi with Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow, having confirmed with Mitsuki that Suigetsu's similar jutsu also makes him vulnerable to Lightning Release, and that it's meant to be used in areas with unlimited water. If he times his attacks right, Funamushi can no longer use his Water Release. Kawaki notices Funamushi is still waiting for something, and it begins to rain, which allows to create a giant water jellyfish. With it, Funamushi beings attacking indiscriminately, even his own men in an attempt to avenge Seiren. Aware of the damage already inflicted on Funamushi, Boruto believes he can win by landing a Rasengan in close range. Hebiichigo confirms that Boruto needs Funamushi to stay still for a moment. The rest of Team 7 draw Funamushi's attention, moving out of the way of his attacks. Hebiichigo is able to stop him, but something so big is hard to hold in place for long. Metal protects Hebiichigo while she holds Funamushi still. Some of the tentacles still prevent Boruto from getting close. Sarada, Mitsuki, and Buntan attack with Lightning Release from a distance. Funamushi breaks free and lands a hit on Hebiichigo. He also manages to swipe at Kawaki, and Boruto. Despite this, Boruto moves through the jellyfish, and lands his Rasengan. Funamushi manages to hold Boruto like he did Kagura, but Buntan stabs him, avenging Kagura. The Funato retreat.

They're concerned about Iwabee and Denki, but Metal is still searching for them with Team 7's assistance. They find an injured Funato soldier, and take him back to the village, where Sarada heals him. Buntan disapproves, giving his allegiance to Funamushi, who killed Kagura. Other villagers share the sentiment, despite Sarada pointing out he might have information on Denki and Iwabee. Boruto says that Kagura has been avenged, and Buntan questions the cost of that. Kawaki says casualties are part of war, and Buntan counters that Araumi is still alive, so they have to join up with Kirigakure's forces. She's doubtful of what advantage keeping Denki and Iwabee alive would give Funamushi, and if they were, they'd have been used as bargaining chips already. Sarada asks for one more day on the village, which Buntan agrees to. Sarada checks on Boruto at Kagura's grave, where he admits he thought that avenging him would make him feel better, but it didn't. Sarada takes responsibility for Hebiichigo's death as captain. They agree that Kagura would be glad they saved the village, and commit themselves to finding Denki and Iwabee, and bringing them home. The next day, Yamame and Iwana invite Kyoh\u014d to stay on the village, something no one has ever asked him. By their graves, Buntan tells Kagura and Hebiichigo that thanks to his petition, they have been pardoned. Denki and Iwabee show up just as Metal's faith in them being alive begins to waver. Back at the village, they eat, and explain what happened while they were captive. One of Funamushi's subordinates wanted to kill them, but upon learning they were gathering food for children, Funamushi merely had them tied up. When the Funato fled after hearing of Funamushi's defeat, they used the opportunity to escape, Iwabee cutting through their restraints with an Earth Release. They share their theories on why Funamushi didn't kill them or used them in negotiations, which Boruto finds hard to believe. Sarada wants them all to sleep early so they can leave early in the morning, but Boruto goes scouting. Kyoh\u014d tells Iwana and Yamame he can't stay because he has to help Buntan. While keeping watch at night, Boruto is attacked by Gokai, who lures him into a trap where someone else tries hitting him with blow-darts. Boruto defeats Gokai, sending him through an alarm system to alert his friends. He discovers his other assailant is Kobuna, who is there to avenge his father, Funamushi. His words remind Boruto of his own, and Buntan's, giving him pause. Sarada arrives in time to protect him, Gokai and Kobuna retreating. He tells Sarada who Kobuna is. Kawaki clashes with Boruto over him understanding Kobuna's feelings. Mitsuki is impressed that Kawaki is always able to convey his feelings and clash with people, admitting his own difficulty in doing so. Kawaki says Mitsuki must also have a way, one that isn't aggressive like Kawaki's, as he has known Boruto for a long while. When they arrive, everyone else is prepared to question the captured Funato soldier. Boruto tells them about Kobuna, and they argue over the cycle of vengeance. If they stop fighting, the situation with the Funato won't be resolved, but if they continue, they'll breed more resentment. The captured Funato soldier laughs at Boruto, saying he's already been an enemy of the Funato since long before Funamushi because he injured Seiren, whose younger brother is Ikada, to everyone's shock.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "250", "Episode Title": "The_Blood_of_the_Funato", "Japanese Airdate": "22 May 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Ikada keeps Seiren company, who's still unconscious, changing her IV drip. Kobuna arrives, bringing Seiren many seashells. Ikada finds them beautiful, thinking it must have taken time to gather them. Kobuna boasts being able stay underwater for three minutes, and asks about Ikada's ship drawing, which he claims is nothing important. Ikada orders a guard to keep watch when Kobuna takes him outside, showing off his progress with the blowpipe. Kobuna confesses his mother asked him to check on Ikada, get him out from time to time. He says that with it, he can fight Kirigakure, and that his father would teach him to fight after returning from his mission. They watch everyone who lives with them working on the ships and training, each one pulling their weight. Kobuna asks if Ikada won't fight, and he says he's not good at it. Kobuna thinks he just has to train like him, but Ikada points out his lack of gills, unlike his siblings. Kobuna finds him amazing nonetheless, and Ikada mentions someone else saying the same. Araumi and Isari arrive, Araumi complaining about how much time Ikada spends taking care of Seiren, which won't change anything for him. Ikada pulls away, telling his father not to decide what he needs to do. He goes to help the women repairing the ships. One asks about Seiren, another whose husband was killed by Kirigakure asks if Ikada will fight. Jibiki reports the clan's unfavourable situation to Araumi, believing it's only a matter of time before Kirigakure discovers where they are. Repairs to the mobile fortress are also delayed over lack of materials. Araumi yells to just steal it, but Isari counters they don't have the manpower, being spread thin on every front. Araumi asks about Funamushi, who Jibiki confirms should have received the order to cancel the ambush. Isari wants to retreat so they can regroup to launch another attack. Araumi is appalled that Isari would abandon avenging their men killed by Kirigakure, and Isari counters that they also have to protect those who are left. Araumi accuses Isari of becoming a coward during his imprisonment, Isari telling him he has no idea of what he and his siblings endured to rebuild the clan. Araumi asks about Ikada, and Isari still questions why Araumi expects so much from him. Araumi blames Isari for the loss of half their ships, Tenma's death, and Seiren's condition. Enraged, Isari transforms his harpoon, which Araumi reminds him was given to him by Araumi, so it won't defy his commands. Still angry, Isari leaves. Araumi swims to the seabed, and drops a pearl at a frozen woman, Minamo. He thinks back to a fight when Ikada was a newborn, feeling uncomfortable with him being on the battlefield, though Minamo remained unconcerned, believing he'd grow into a wonderful leader. Kirigakure launched freezing attacks, which hit Minamo. Araumi chastised her for protecting Ikada, but she made him promise her he'd raise Ikada well before being completely frozen and sinking. Back on land, Araumi is notified of Funamushi's death. He demands explanations from Gokai, who explains they couldn't back down from avenging Seiren, managing to kill Kagura, but failing to kill a Konoha shinobi, who Ikada understands to be Boruto. Kobuna and his mother arrive, and break down crying. Kobuna wants to know who was responsible, and Ikada tells him it's not his job to avenge him, that's for the adults to do. Araumi chastises him, asking when he'll want to avenge his family, and grows more furious when Ikada says he doesn't even remember his mother. Araumi says his mother will never be able to rest in peace if Ikada doesn't avenge her, Ikada saying he never wanted to be chosen. Ikada grows angrier as Araumi throws him around, Isari noticing a glass of water shaking. Ikada leaves, and Isari goes to check on him. Neither understand why Araumi places his hopes on Ikada, and Isari explains his indecisiveness causes them harm. He explains that Seiren would have gone straight to the ambush, but stopped to get Ikada because she believed his power was essential. Isari thinks Ikada is holding out hope that Seiren will get better so he has an excuse not to fight. A guard informs Ikada that Seiren called out for him. He rushes to see her, but her memories are hazy. She tries getting out of bed, dropping Kobuna's seashells on the floor and stepping one of them before falling down. She starts to bleed, telling Ikada that their future is bright, and to reclaim their seas. Ikada lies to her, claiming the ambush was successfully carried out by their father and himself, and that Kirigakure has been wiped out. She dies in peace. Kobuna has Gokai give him the same tattoo as his father's, and asks to take him to the ones who killed Funamushi. Isari talks to Jibiki, believing Araumi to be too consumed by hatred to make sound decisions. He wishes to make peace with Kirigakure, intending to take advantage of still having control over the seas, and certain that they also want to avoid an all-out war. Araumi has no idea, and he wishes to broach the subject with Kirigakure in secret. At dawn, Ikada rips his ship design paper and dives into the ocean. The waves stop as his power awakens, and waters raise him, now bearing gills. Araumi celebrates. Ikada dons a new outfit, with a harsh look in his eyes.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "251", "Episode Title": "Their_Resolve", "Japanese Airdate": "29 May 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Misuno confirms Kagura's and Hebiichigo's deaths in action while repelling the detached Funato unit with Konoha's help to Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d is frustrated, having hoped that Kagura would be Mizukage one day, and is determined to wipe out the Funato clan. A messenger arrives with a top secret message from Isari. Back in Kagura's village, everyone is in disbelief that Ikada is a Funato, but Boruto recalls the peculiarity of his body transformation, and believes it. He is heartbroken to have become the target of someone else's revenge. Misuno questions Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d why he'd agree to negotiate with the Funato. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d personally has no reservations against wiping out the Funato, but as Mizukage, he knows the Funato maintain control over northeastern waters, and understands that drawing out the conflict would mean more casualties. Isari arrives with Jibiki. Though tense and filled with posturing, Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Isari agree to talk, however, the Funato suddenly take over the airwaves, and Araumi addresses Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and the daimy\u014d, announcing an offensive with their main forces. When Araumi says they'll crush anyone in their way, even if they're related, the Marlin Harpoon acts on its own and stabs Isari, killing him. Jibiki blames himself for not stopping Isari from coming. The harpoon attempts to attack Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d, but Misuno cuts it down. All over the Land of Water, everyone watches Araumi swear they won't back down to honour the many Funato they have lost. The Konoha shinobi and the swordsmen are shocked when Araumi announces that Ikada has joined him, and will lead them in battle, having previously thought Ikada couldn't fight. Their first target on the way to Kirigakure is the Shinonome 1. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d gives the order to protect the power station and intercept the Funato. The captive Funato continues talking down to them, so Buntan knocks him out. Most of them want to keep fighting the Funato, even if Ikada is among them. Mitsuki asks Boruto what his feelings are, and Boruto still thinks of Ikada as his friend. He wants to talk Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d, who Sarada also wants to see, wishing to return Hiramekarei. Buntan and Kyoh\u014d intend to keep fighting to avenge Kagura and Hebiichigo, and attack. Iwabee and Denki protect them, buying them time to escape. Metal Lee does nothing, torn between his team-mates and his desire to avenge Hebiichigo. Kawaki is frustrated by Boruto's choice. Ikada wants the Funato main forces to sail through the Sea of Death, the shortest route to the Shinonome 1 so they can arrive before Kirigakure has time to prepare. Despite the Funato's apprehension in crossing such dangerous waters, Ikada motivates them. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d is notified of it, and wants to set sail immediately.

The ship they arrived on was destroyed, so they need a new one. She asks Boruto if he really thinks he can stop the war. From his encounter with Kobuna, Boruto hopes to get through to both Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d and Ikada. They ask for help at a shipyard, but they refuse to set sail during the war, or to lend them a ship. Kajiki calls out to them, and Boruto asks to take them on his ship. Kajiki obliges, having heard the broadcast, not expecting it from Ikada, though Boruto feels he doesn't look surprised. Kajiki explains he comes from a family of fisherman, and he doesn't care much for how either the Funato or Kirigakure do things, and asks Boruto to tell both Ikada and the Mizukage that. He has faith that Boruto's words will reach Ikada. Boruto is impressed by Kajiki's ability to navigate the rough sea. Ikada takes the Funato fleet through enormous waves, impressing everyone. Araumi recalls how Ikada struggled with training when he was a little child, and wishes Tenma and Seiren could see him now. He also recalls how Jibiki informed him of Isari's plans, and instructed him to go along, while also instructing the Marlin Harpoon to kill Isari. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d reflects on the losses caused by the Funato, vowing to end them. Kajiki drops Team 7 at the Mizukage's ship, Boruto identifying himself with Hiramekarei. He returns it to Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d, who asks why they're there. He appreciates it if they want to avenge Kagura, but thinks the situation has escalated too much for them to remain involved. Boruto says he wants the conflict to stop to avoid more casualties. Misuno is incensed by the suggestion, and though Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d understands Boruto, he can't do nothing and let the Funato destroy the Shinonome 1 station. They point out some people are against the station, and ask if they ever discussed it with the Funato. Misuno recounts how Isari came to talk to them about peace, but was killed by his own weapon as they began discussions, believing it to be a failed attempt to assassinate Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d. He asks what would be the point at talking at this point. Boruto instead asks time to talk to Ikada, explaining what they've been through together before learning he was a Funato. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d has no faith in that, but Boruto points out how Kagura trusted Buntan and the others until the end, who eventually worked hard to meet Kagura's expectations. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d agrees to give them some time to try getting the Funato to back off, but they refuse to take a guard with them. He asks Boruto what he'll do if he's unable to get the Funato to stop fighting, and Boruto says he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it. Ikada continues to use his power to navigate the furious waters, parting waves so their fleet can go through it. They get in sight of the Shinonome station and the Kirigakure fleet. Denki and Iwabee struggle to keep Kyoh\u014d and Buntan from going after Team 7, while Metal just wants them all the stop. Yamame and Iwana update the village on the upcoming clash between the Funato and Kirigakure. They agree to stop fighting and go after Boruto as allies for now. Sarada pilots Kajiki's ship. Misuno asks Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d why he's taking such a risk with Boruto, and he explains that Boruto was able to change Kagura's mind in the past, so he's hoping he can pull it off again. Sarada and Mitsuki ask Boruto how he'll get through to Ikada, who seemed so different in the broadcast. Boruto considers himself to be the reason why Ikada changed, and asks Sarada and Mitsuki to trust and watch over him.

Ikada destroys the ship with a waterspout, Mitsuki pulling Boruto and Sarada onto the Funato ship. Kirigakure listens in on their conversation from afar. Ikada tells Boruto not to ask for anything ridiculous, threatening to kill them. Boruto wants the Funato to stop the war, and Araumi laughs. Boruto explains he spoke with Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d, who agreed to stop fighting if the Funato stop as well. Araumi and Ikada both can't take the Mizukage at face value. Misuno isn't surprised by their lack of cooperation, but Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d says they promised Team 7 some more time. Araumi says they won't leave the ship alive, and leaves to attend another matter. Ikada assures them he intends to fight until one side goes down. Boruto reminds him of his dreams of building a big ship, sailing the world with it, connecting islands and people by trading goods. Ikada says those dreams died with Seiren, and manifests several waterspouts around the ship. Metal informs his team-mates and the swordsmen that Team 7 went aboard a Funato ship, and they get concerned. Buntan thinks joining up with them is the best way to get revenge on the Funato. Ikada blames them for the death of his sister, brother, and Funamushi, and claims that even if Kirigakure is destroyed or they die, his hatred will never be abated. He says that Seiren always protected him, and that he felt inferior for being the only one in his family without powers, claiming that wanting to become a shipbuilder was an excuse he tried making himself believe. Now that he has power, he will use it to lead the Funato and destroy Kirigakure. The waterspouts subside, the Funato's mobile fortress arrives, the Shinonome 1 in firing range of its charging Chakra Cannon. Araumi takes a boat to the mobile fortress, which Kawaki notices. Sarada and Mitsuki tell Boruto he's tried more than enough. Boruto says he understand how Ikada feels, recalling his own feelings about Kagura's death, and once again asks to end the war. Ikada hits him, telling him he's abandoned the past. Sarada says they're also putting side the feelings of losing people dear to them to stop the war, and Mitsuki adds that there are people who need the Shinonome 1. Ikada calls Kobuna in to confront Boruto. Boruto comments on how Kobuna is like him when he lost Kagura, Ikada saying Kobuna will never abandon his hatred until he kills Boruto. Ikada claims he'll put his sword away if Boruto brings him the Mizukage's head. Kawaki spies on Araumi, having followed him to the chakra cannon on the mobile fortress.

Sarada and Mitsuki try to dissuade Boruto, Mitsuki saying he can't afford to lose Boruto. Ikada says he'll consider it if Sarada and Mitsuki can stay back and watch Boruto die, but they refuse. Boruto says he's scared of dying, and believes that everyone who has died in the war felt the same, that others were saddened by their deaths. He feels that someone has to be the one to take on the pain to stop the war, and is willing to be that person, and asks Sarada and Mitsuki not to take revenge for him. Gokai interjects, arguing that as the one who killed Funamushi, Boruto doesn't deserve an easy death. Ikada allows him and the others to attack Boruto, while Boruto asks Sarada and Mitsuki to stay still. Araumi considers what Ikada came up with fun. Kawaki wonders what Boruto is doing as he prepares to kill Araumi. Sarada and Mitsuki approach Boruto on the floor, while Ikada mocks them. Sarada asks Boruto if he trusts the Funato to stop fighting after he dies, but standing up, Boruto says it's not about trust, it's about what he needs to do. Ikada stops the other Funato from attacking, saying Kobuna has the right of delivering the killing blow. Ikada explains that the strong currents where they are will never allow him to resurface, showing them a ramp for Boruto to be tossed off the ship. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d allows Misuno to prepare an attack on the mobile fortress, thinking Boruto's naivete won't stop the war. Team 5 and the swordsmen approach the Funato on a ship of their own. Kobuna is eager to avenge his father, and Boruto tells Kobuna how alike they were in seeking revenge. Boruto's wish for his death to quell their anger and hatred shakes Kobuna's resolve, and Boruto says he doesn't have to get blood on his hands, stepping off the ship himself. Ikada dares Sarada and Mitsuki to try avenging Boruto. Mitsuki struggles not to get into Sage Mode. Ikada is puzzled by their inaction despite the Funato taunting them about Boruto. Sarada confirms that she does hate them, having known Boruto since childhood, considering him a brother. Relating to that pain, and finding it impossible to suppress, Ikada eggs her on to take revenge. She does activate her Sharingan and take out a kunai, but she stops herself, throwing it on the floor. Mitsuki does the same, saying that if they attack, Boruto's wish will be in vain. Kobuna begins sobbing, and asks Ikada to tell him if he did the right thing by avenging his father. Ikada thinks of Seiren, and jumps into the ocean to save Boruto. He rises out in a sea dragon, going far enough up to split the storm clouds above them. Everyone is in awe of Ikada's power. Araumi is angry that he saved Boruto. Boruto is surprised to be alive, and Ikada tells him he won, his friends not trying to take revenge. Boruto tells him it's not about winning or losing. Ikada returns them to the ship, dispelling the sea dragon. Gokai questions why Ikada saved him, and he plainly answers because they didn't seek revenge. He declares the war over and orders their withdrawal. Gokai questions why Seiren and Funamushi died for. One of the Funato soldiers wants the fighting to stop so his children don't get drawn into it. Kobuna continues crying, and several Funato soldiers drop their harpoons, Gokai considering them a disgrace. Araumi aims the Chakra Cannon to the Shinonome 1, voicing his disappointment in Ikada. Kawaki enters the room, and tells him he's already lost to Boruto and Ikada. Araumi refuses to give up, so Kawaki slashes his throat with his bladed arm. Gokai tries to rile up the Funato soldiers to keep on fighting, but Boruto wants their future to be different from their past, mentioning Kagura's wish for his village to be a symbol of peace. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d admits he has a lot to learn, having dismissed Boruto's determination as naivete. Buntan chooses to abandon seeking revenge for Kagura and Hebiichigo.

Naruto and Shikamaru speculate that due to his position and involvement, he's likely to face charges. Boruto wants to contact Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d to confirm Ikada's status. Kawaki sees nothing wrong with Ikada facing punishment, as he was a commander. Boruto points out that Ikada stopped the fighting, and that resentment over punishing him despite that might spark the conflict again.

Kawaki leaves and comes across Team 5. Iwabee deduces he fought with Boruto based on his mood. Denki has to stop things from escalating, and they recall Kagura's wishes.

Naruto and Boruto talk about what he went through in private. Naruto relates to how Boruto feels, having gone through something similar. He tells Boruto to patch things up with Kawaki. Mitsuki checks up on Kawaki, feeling that Kawaki had mixed feelings during his argument with Boruto. He thinks Boruto has influenced Kawaki, so much so that Kawaki didn't kill Araumi.

Buntan tells him to take care of their friends' graves. Shikamaru informs Naruto of a follow-up communication from Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d, which Naruto wishes to inform Boruto about. Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d informs Ikada they've decided what to do with him and informs him that the Shinonome Project has been halted, in a bid to get proper popular support before developing the nation.

However, they're still concerned that someone might want to organise another movement around Ikada, who is the only Funato heir left. Out of gratitude for his decision to stop the conflict, Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d decided not to imprison Ikada, but instead to put him under surveillance, under Kajiki. Sarada tries to get Boruto and Kawaki to talk to patch things up, but they end up fighting. Sarada is concerned, but Mitsuki and Naruto join her, tell her not to worry and let them fight.

Inojin senses something wrong with Jingo, and they arrived at his thrashed shop, where he draws birds to track him. Shikadai's team finds the thieves' hideout, and he recognises Jingo from earlier. He notices Inojin's birds, and sends him a message, notifying them of their location. The thieves demand to know where the data is, but Jingo knows nothing about it. The Konoha shinobi all subdue the thieves. Ch\u014dch\u014d rushes Jingo to finish his recipe, and Shikadai suspects he's still involved when the data isn't recovered from the thieves. Shikadai checks on Inojin and Ch\u014dch\u014d on Jingo's shop, where he discovers the missing data when Ch\u014dch\u014d tries putting the spice on her ramen. As Shikadai talks about team-work, it inspires Jingo on how to improve his recipe, using flavoured chips like the ones Ch\u014dch\u014d eats to change it up. Team 10 approves his recipe. Later, Teams 10 and 7 go have ramen at Jingo's but there's a long line over the positive review from the ramen critic.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "257", "Episode Title": "Konohamaru_Becomes_the_Hokage?!", "Japanese Airdate": "10 July 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Konohamaru arrives at the Hokage's office to deliver a mission report, and finds Naruto pondering whether to take up an invitation to guest star in a Kagemasa movie. However, Himawari won a hot springs trip in a lottery, so Naruto decided to take time off so they could go as a family. Shikamaru reminds him it has to be him, as the movie's climax will feature a Rasengan. Naruto dreads telling Himawari he'll miss the trip, fearing she'll block his tenketsu again. Konohamaru offers to go in Naruto's place, as he also knows the Rasengan, and tells Naruto to enjoy his trip. Konohamaru arrives at the studio, and introduces himself to the crew. He also meets Kagemasa's actor, Gongor\u014d Kamakura, who has hurt his back and is done filming for the day. Gongor\u014d says he'll forego a prep meeting the next day. The crew hands Konohamaru a script, and immediately ask to start shooting a scene. Despite being able to transform into Naruto, the make-up artists merely draw his whiskers on. Konohamaru shoots a scene in a green screen, he thinks he fumbled his line, but the crew members are unconcerned. Konohamaru is also appalled by how the actor portraying Shikamaru is so unlike him. Konohamaru watches a fixed version of the scene they shot, with effects added in, and feels like he's filmed in an assembly line. The assistant director agrees, and comments on how the director used to film, which is what inspired him to join the business. However, since the current producer joined in, things have shifted more towards CG instead of practical effects and filming on location instead of relying on the skill of cast and crew. Konohamaru expresses his wish to convey how cool Naruto is in the fight scene the next day. The assistant director hides the key to the studio, forcing them to shoot on location, which Konohamaru helps by getting a number of stores to close. This also forces everyone to try harder. The producer is furious the shooting was done without his permission, and ends up firing everyone other than the main actors. Konohamaru and the crew go drinking, and the director asks Konohamaru to bear with it and go back shooting for Gongor\u014d's sake. The next day, Konohamaru sees the assistant director in a hostage situation by a bank, and assists with the situation, but ends up making the situation worse by bringing up the hostage holder's family, who are the other criminals he just attacked. The director watches it, wishing he could film it. The rest of the crew arrives, having seen the assistant director on tv, and they agree they should film it. They ask for the camera of the news crew broadcasting the situation. Gongor\u014d arrives at the studio, and sees the director trying to get the camera. The hostage holder threatens to blow up the area with an explosive tag. Gongor\u014d shows up as Kagemasa, which distracts the criminal enough for Konohamaru to deal with the explosive tag. However, his kunai is chipped and doesn't cut through the tag. Gongor\u014d manages to punch him out, his back giving out, but not before the criminal activates the tag. Konohamaru wonders how to escape while carrying Gongor\u014d and the assistant director, both injured, but Gongor\u014d reminds him he's acting as the Hokage. Konohamaru contains the explosion with a Rasengan. The director mentions how they used to make the Kagemasa movies in the beginning, when they had no budget or equipment, and that Konohamaru reminded them of that. The producer is impressed with the footage, and hires everyone back, the sponsors having been moved by the footage. The director also has the producer prepare the CG for an extra flash finale, and praises the assistant director's eye. At home, Konohamaru sharpens his kunai while listening to positive news about the movie.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "258", "Episode Title": "The_Uzumaki_Family's_Hot_Springs_Vacation", "Japanese Airdate": "17 July 2022", "episode synopsis text": "The Uzumaki arrive at a hot springs inn to enjoy a vacation. Boruto wonders if Kawaki might be scared of ghosts haunting the old inn. In Konoha, Mirai arrives at the Hokage's office, and finds Shikamaru dealing with Naruto's paper work. He explains that Naruto's family won a hot springs inn trip on a raffle, and Mirai recognises the inn as the one she previously stayed at with Guy and Kakashi, which had a ghost story associated with it. Boruto and Kawaki notice a slash in one of the statues in the inn. The hostess takes them to their room, and they eat. Boruto suggests they play ping-pong, but is frustrated when Kawaki struggles to learn the basics. Naruto and Hinata win against Boruto and Kawaki with their superior team-work while Himawari acts as referee. They have a luxurious dinner and go to the hot springs. Kawaki recalls not wanting to go on trip at the start. Boruto and Kawaki stay on the hot springs until late, trying to outlast each other. Naruto loses at matching games to Himawari. Boruto spots a stamp hunt and takes Kawaki to participate. The inn's ghost follows them around as they collect the stamps, Kawaki figuring out the tricks behind the spooky aspects and teasing Boruto about it. Their prize is a commemorative photo. Himawari is angry they didn't take her to the hunt, activating her Byakugan. Boruto apologises and urges Kawaki to do the same. They take the photo. Kawaki is glad to have come, and Naruto tells him they consider him family. They go to sleep, but the inn's ghost is still following Boruto and Kawaki, who have bad dreams.

They find another victim with slashed clothing. Boruto has heard rumours it might be a weasel, but the others think it's a human culprit. The next day, they confirm with the Konoha Police Force that the latest victim is a former shinobi from another village, who specialised in Wind Release. Based on method, they believe all ex-shinobi were attacked by the same person. Kawaki suggests guarding all ex-shinobi users of Wind Release, but Boruto points out too many people fit that description. Team 7 is asked to continue nightly patrols. Boruto and Sarada notice Mitsuki is distracted, and he explains that Mikazuki hasn't shown since returning from Kirigakure. Kawaki asks what Mikazuki looks like, and Boruto suggests putting up missing posters. They decide to rest, and suggest Mitsuki do the same. Mitsuki asks around, but finds nothing. He finds a girl playing the flute, and Mikazuki approaches her, though she calls it Niboshi. It recognises Mitsuki when called Mikazuki. She explains she found it in pain next to her house, so she took it to the vet. After giving it food, Mikazuki decided to stay. Mitsuki notes she knows more about Mikazuki than he does, and she finds it nice that Mikazuki has the freedom to go wherever they want. She explains that since moving to Konoha one year ago, she has had to help her older brother. He asks her to look after Mikazuki when he's away on missions. Hibiki's brother calls out to her. After Mitsuki leaves, her brother reminds her not to befriend shinobi. Another ex-shinobi is attacked, and Team 7 pursues them, Mitsuki managing to injure one of two assailants on the arm. He stops at Hibiki's brother's oden cart, asking if he saw the assailants. He claims they escaped to the roof. Mitsuki notices blood by the stand, but tells the team to resume pursuit while he goes check on the victim. Hibiki hides injured behind the stand. In their apartment, Hibiki's brother tends to her injury. She wonders if they should stop. He says they only have one more target before he can assure she has a normal life. The public pressures the police upon learning of another attack. The police reports to Team 7 that there was a smell of smoke on the victims clothes, and they speculate this might be how they're knocked unconscious. They wonder if the slashed clothes means they're looking for something, and are waiting for more information on similar incidents in other villages. The shopkeeper Mitsuki spoke to, also an ex-shinobi, reads about the attacks on the newspaper. He throws a rock at Mikazuki when taking out the trash. Mitsuki thinks back to the Rain Killer incident. He asks Hibiki who the next target is. She explains her father was a shinobi who was killed by a thief who used Wind Release, who was left with a scar on his chest by her father's sword. Mitsuki reveals he failed to stop someone like them in the past, wishing to avoid past mistakes. He asks that she turn herself in. She thanks Mitsuki for letting her go once, and leaves. At night, the police learns that a person of interest in a series of robberies and murders is living in Konoha. Hibiki and her brother use sleeping smoke on the Matsushige shopkeeper, but reading about it on the newspaper allowed him to counter it. They ask if he has a scar on his chest. K\u014dtar\u014d F\u016bma reports to Team 7 that Daizen Matsushige is a Wind Release user who was a witness to robberies and murders. Mitsuki realises he's the shopkeeper he spoke with and rushes ahead. Daizen intends to kill Hibiki and her brother in self-defence, and attacks with the Sickle Weasel Technique, which Hibiki's brother recognises. Mitsuki blocks an attack with his Lightning Release: Snake Lightning. Team 7 and K\u014dtar\u014d arrive, Daizen accusing Hibiki and her brother of being behind the slashing attacks, Hibiki accusing Daizen of having the scar that proves he killed her father. Daizen shows his chest, bearing no scar, but Mikazuki jumps on him, scratching his chest, removing the disguise and revealing the scar. He says the scar isn't proof of any crime, but Mitsuki points out the injury he gave Hibiki with his Wind Release. K\u014dtar\u014d intends to compare it with injuries from the other robberies and murders. Daizen tries running away, but Mitsuki stops him with Wind Release: Breakthrough. Daizen was planning to commit the same crimes in Konoha, so Hibiki and her brother are only banished from the village. However, since Mitsuki withheld his knowledge of their guilt, he's on administrative leave for a week. He bids Hibiki and her brother farewell, and she gives him niboshi to feed Mikazuki.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "260", "Episode Title": "Fireworks_of_Love", "Japanese Airdate": "31 July 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto helps Kakashi, who claims to have a bad back, running some errands in Konoha. While treating Boruto to dango, they overhear two elderly men arguing. Boruto wonders if they should interfere, but Kakashi argues against it. Boruto wonders if he was really a Hokage, and Kakashi says he has had his fill of mediating fights with Naruto and Sasuke. When more people join the old men's argument, Boruto tries breaking them up. One of the man's grandson and the other's granddaughter also try stopping the fight, before both sides decide to leave. As he leaves, the girl's grandfather knocks Kakashi's tea, spilling it on his face. He is unfazed by it. The girl apologises and gives them a complementary dish. Boruto asks what the fight was about. She explains that a rivalry developed over setting off festival fireworks between people of the old town and the new city. Boruto noticed the interaction between Yubeshi and Sabure, and she confesses they're planning to get married, having already picked a date, but with all the arguing, they haven't been able to inform their grandfathers. Kakashi was reading an Icha Icha volume, but heard Yubeshi, and compares her story to what happened in volume 5 of the series, though he doesn't know how it ended, its intensity caused many readers to pass out, so it was removed from the book after the first edition. Yubeshi shows Kakashi her first edition copy of that volume, which she considered throwing away after being unable to sell it at the flea market. She asks Kakashi to sort the situation between their grandfathers before giving it to him. They visit Taruto's pastry shop, and Kakashi deduces from photos and covered menus that he and Ohagi were close for a long time, and remained so until rather recently. He asks them to leave. Sabure checks on them, and explains how their fight started when Taruto, who used to participate in old town's fireworks display with Ohagi, was put in charge of new city's display when they decided to start one. Kakashi left while Boruto was listening to Sabure, leaving a note that he has more shopping to do and leaving the situation to Boruto. Boruto goes back to Ohagi's dango shop to get him to talk to Taruto. Boruto gathers everyone to talk about the dispute, including Kakashi. They argue until Boruto signals for Sabure and Yubeshi to bring in the dango cakes that Ohagi and Taruto developed together. Boruto thinks this might remind them of their friendship, but it only underlines the time period of when the dispute began. Kakashi suggests that Yubeshi and Sabure elope, but they want their grandfathers to celebrate with them. Since they can't make peace over it, Kakashi suggests turning it into a competition on the day of the festival, with the winner being responsible for the fireworks from then on. Sabure, Yubeshi, and Boruto are unsure of it, but Kakashi is confident in his plan, and disappears as both sides begin making preparations. Someone mentions to the new city group that the weather is perfect for fireworks that day, with no clouds in the sky, though no one knows who that is. When the fireworks start, Yubeshi and Sabure recognise something about the display. So do Ohagi and Taruto, who wish to stop the fireworks, but can't. Kakashi switched new city's and old town's fireworks, so each side was actually mocking their own fireworks, causing them to lose heart about the rivalry. Later, Kakashi asks Taruto and Ohagi who was the winner, and Sabure and Yubeshi urge them to make up, pointing out they no longer seem to have fun setting up the fireworks, and that they can't get married with them fighting. Their grandfathers are surprised by it, and realising what they put their grandchildren though, make up. The next day, Boruto puts soothing bandages on Kakashi's back, which is hurting from moving the heavy fireworks around. Kakashi also got Yubeshi's first edition Icha Icha volume, but is taking his time reading it so he can enjoy it. Sabure and Yubeshi get married, with their grandfathers in attendance.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "261", "Episode Title": "Kawaki_Enters_the_Ninja_Academy!", "Japanese Airdate": "7 August 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Iruka welcomes a new class of Academy students. Naruto gives them a speech about what he hopes they learn. Among the new students are Himawari, her friends Eh\u014d Norimaki and Yuina Itomaki, and Kawaki. She is glad they're with her. Some boys ask Mimi for a trick with her dog. Kawaki is in the Academy for a secret mission, guarding Kae Yukiwari, heir to the crown in the Land of Bamboo, a smaller ally nation. Kae's life is being threatened by another claimant to the crown, so her father sent her to Konoha for protection. Kae herself is unaware of the threat, and is excited to study abroad. Kawaki is lower profile than Boruto, and is to keep at the mission until Kae's father uncovers who is behind the threat. Naruto also asked him to keep the mission from Himawari. Their homeroom teacher, Hana Kaka, introduces herself, followed by other students. Most of the class is excited about Himawari being Naruto's daughter, Osuka Kamakura being Gongor\u014d Kamakura's daughter, and Kae being a princess from a foreign nation. Most of them are scared of Kawaki, though Kae finds him interesting. Eiki F\u016bma develops a crush on her, and Osuka is annoyed at not being the centre of attention. Kawaki approaches Kae, and mistakenly comes across as hitting on her. Hana is quite timid, as this is her first class as a teacher. Anko and Shino reassure her she'll get better at it. At home, Himawari tells about her day, and Boruto wonders why Kawaki would want to attend the Academy. Himawari wants to ask Kawaki why he was acting strange at the Academy, and Boruto wonders if he was nervous. As the days go by, the students continue finding Kawaki odd, knowing personal details about Naruto, but nothing about the previous Hokage, getting battle-ready when woken up by the school bell, and having a cute, packed lunchbox. Himawari notices him paying attention to Kae, and can tell Kawaki is hiding something. She tells him of Kae's interest in romance novels, so he buys one, puzzled at how it might be useful. Reporters come to take photos of her at class. Eiki tries to best Kawaki, who he finds suspicious, in sparring to impress Kae, but he effortlessly dodges all of Eiki's attacks. At the infirmary, Eiki hears Anko and Hana talking about the tool storage room, and sneaks into it. Kawaki finds Kae acting like herself, and she explains people have expectations of how a princess should act, so she plays along as she's a representative of her country. Eiki arrives, thinking Kawaki lured Kae somewhere remote, and attacks him with a summoning scroll. However, he lacks a contract, and is knocked out by the summoned creature. Kawaki defeats the summon with a punch, commenting on his preference for such missions. She asks who he is, and he says he just wants to be her friend, and offers her the romance novel he bought. She promises to be his friend if he keeps her true personality a secret. Kawaki bemoans having to keep another secret, but accepts it. She looks forward to knowing him, and is concerned about Eiki, but Kawaki says he'll wake up soon. At night, a subordinate asks about her time in the Academy, and Kae is pleased to have made a friend, wanting to enjoy the last of her freedom. Kawaki reports to Naruto about the mission, and complains about the low-level exercises. Naruto tells him he'll see things to learn at the Academy.

He deduces she eavesdropped on him. She promises to keep his secret mission quiet, and explains he's been acting different since starting at the Academy. Himawari offers to help him, but he refuses. Kae's class-mates noticed how little she eats compared to everyone else, attributing it to her refined upbringing. Osuka brags about her personal chef, and bosses Neon about her tea, which she delivers with a drone. Because her parents are executives at the Kaminarimon Company, she has access to many prototypes. Eiki remains suspicious of Kawaki. Kae excuses to herself to have a proper meal alone. Kawaki warns that if she insists on keeping up appearances, she'll never hit it off with anyone. Kae decides to host an event to let her make many friends at once. Osuka is planning to host a tea party, and denies wanting friends when Neon suggests that's the case, claiming she wants to emulate her mother. At the classroom, Kae invites everyone to a tea party that weekend. Eh\u014d passes on it, and Osuka is frustrated on being upstaged. At night, Kawaki recalls Naruto's and Shikamaru's instructions to protect her at the party, and decides to figure the tea party out as it unfolds. Himawari startles him, saying that's not an option, and stresses the importance of proper tea party etiquette, saying he needs her help. Kae decorates a cake by herself, despite Batora's opinion of it being unnecessary. Kae wants to be a perfect host, like her mother used to be, recalling her advice to do things her own way. The next day, Kae's class-mates are impressed by the tea party, but are puzzled by Kawaki's presence. Kawaki's unconvincing answer when Eiki questions his attendance requires Himawari to cover for him. When he claims his favourite sweet is taiyaki, the kids are surprised that Kae doesn't know what it is. Kawaki struggles to remember Himawari's instructions, drawing attention to himself, but she aids him quickly. Osuka tries to downplay her enjoyment of Kae's tea. When she mentions her parents' actor friends attending tea parties at her house, Himawari mentions Gaara as a friend of her parents who visits them, who their class-mates find even more impressive, frustrating Osuka. Kae and Himawari bond over having leaders for fathers. Kae asks Kawaki why he decided to attend the Academy, and recalling Himawari's advice not to talk anything violent, claims that he could have his fill of taiyaki by earning money as a shinobi. They laugh, being more at ease with Kawaki's awkwardness when they previously found him scary. When Kae leaves to get the cake, a few of the kids comment on how exhausting the formality of the party is. Kae's servants serve the cake, which Osuka secretly injected with spicy mustard. Kawaki smells it, and thinking it's an assassin's poison, rushes over, knocking over the tables to stop Kae from eating it. He also knocks over Batora. Eiki, covered in cake, starts fighting Kawaki. Kae tells them to stop, and asks why Kawaki did it. He can't answer her without exposing his mission. She feels sad, having put so much effort in the cake, and is hurt when Kawaki is dismissive of it. He leaves to cool off, and Osuka is pleased the party was ruined. Neon goes to the restroom. Himawari admonishes Kawaki, telling him to apologise, but to him, if she hates him, that's ok. She realises Kawaki did it because of the mission, and he explains there was something in the cake. Himawari realises it was just a prank with mustard, not an assassination attempt. They deduce it was Osuka, but Himawari wants evidence before accusing her. They check with Batora that the freezer where the cake was stored was closed, but they spot a small open window. Kawaki realises something, and tells Himawari to get to Kae before him. Osuka berates Kae for the incident, who feels she can't react emotionally because of her status. Other students think Osuka is going overboard with it. Himawari arrives, showing everyone the cake had mustard hidden in it. Kawaki arrives with Neon's drone, exposing Osuka as having ordered her to do it, having already questioned Neon, who confessed everything. Osuka tries blaming everything on Neon. Kae yells at her to apologise to Neon and everyone. She's fine with Osuka being upfront with disliking her, but can't forgive forcing Neon into doing something she doesn't want to do. Osuka starts to cry, and Neon attempts to console her. Kae tries to compose herself, but her outburst has endeared her to everyone else. Himawari and Kawaki advise her not to suppress herself. Kawaki says they should give the party another try, and brings in a lot of taiyaki, which Kae tries and enjoys. He apologises for before. Kae is happy it turned out ok, recalling her mother. Osuka promises it's not over between them. Himawari gets Kawaki to admit she helped him, so he won't refuse her help again with the mission.

At the Academy, the students speculate and gossip on who the special instructors might be. Eh\u014d wants them to acknowledge him so he can go on missions with them in the future, impressing Yuina. Soul Tao finds it pretentious. Hana arrives, and introduces Team 7 as the instructors, to the delight of the class and Kawaki's discomfort. The students are impressed by Boruto's Rasengan. Kawaki asks Boruto not to let the students know he's already a genin. Kawaki loses his patience with Boruto, the two start fighting, and get called out by Sarada. She and Mitsuki demonstrate Fire Release and Lightning Release. Hana warns the students not to get too close, and pushes them away from their jutsu with Wind Release when they do. Many of the students ask Team 7 to be their teachers. Hana feels deflated, lacking flashy jutsu. Shino is concerned about Hana, and Anko points out her qualifications, hoping she'll be able to display her true abilities. Everyone is hungry, and were told not to bring lunch. Boruto arrives with Lightning Burgers, which the students will have to fight over, to simulate missions in which they have to fight on empty stomachs. Team 7 sets up who has to fight with who, whoever retains a rubber ball in the end gets to eat, but there are fewer burgers than there are students. They're free to use any ninjutsu, can fight alone or in groups, but will be disqualified if they leave Academy grounds. Sarada gives the go ahead. Neon steals Yuina's with her drone. Hana is concerned, but Team 7's goal is for them to realise they can share the burgers. Mimi eats a candy bar, because it's enough for her, and she doesn't want to take anyone's food. Eh\u014d takes it away, as it defeats the purpose of the exercise, and her dog bites him. Soul tells him to give it back, as there were no rules against the candy bars, seeing it as reading a hidden meaning. Tensions escalate between the students over it. Himawari and Kae inform Boruto about it. He tells about sharing the burgers, but they remain hostile with each other. The next day, only Kae is in class when Himawari and Kawaki arrive, everyone else boycotting class after taking sides with Eh\u014d or Soul. Shino thinks the lesson might have been too advanced for students who know little of team-work. Boruto tries having them make up by playing Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls, but they remain hostile. Kawaki tries reconciling them over food, but they also have different preferences. Hana checks up on the students' records to find what preference they share. Hana visits Soul, and reveals to her that her hero, Might Guy, had a friendly rivalry with Kakashi Hatake, which helped both of them grow, and hopes the same can be true for her. She gifts a tracksuit like Guy's, though Soul isn't as fond of it as she is of Guy, and hands her a letter. Next, she talks to Eh\u014d over ramen at Ichiraku's, also giving him a letter. She's concerned she's not cut out to be a teacher, but is determined to help her students. The next day, everyone waits for Hana outside. She has cancelled class for the day, so everyone can have a cherry blossom viewing party. She uses jutsu to spread paper petals. Soul and Eh\u014d agree to go back to class over seeing how hard Hana is trying and how much she cares about them. Kawaki asks Hana what she would have done if no one had shown up, and she says she had to have faith in her students if she's to have faith in herself as a teacher. They all have a picnic.

Kae joins the group, so Kawaki complains about having to tag along. Himawari prepares the route to investigate all the mysteries. Ran and Suzu try to one up each other. Kura produces several trinkets while looking for ink for Yuina's pen. Shino arrives and tells them that while they can stay after hours, they have to clean the Academy as part of their training. The students leave, misremembering Shino's name. Kawaki offers to clean up, and Shino regrets not having much interaction with students lately. At night, they enter the Academy. Kae splits from the main group, and explains to Kawaki there's no way the Seven Mysteries are real, so to preserve everyone else's dreams, she had Batora fake them. Kae convinces Kawaki to help them. The rest of the group notices their absence. Kura wonders if one of the mysteries got to them, and the twins try to assure one another it's ok for them to leave. Batora and Kawaki scare the group as moving anatomical models. S\u014dsha flees in fear. In the training area, kunai barely miss them, but when Himawari turns the lights on, no one else is there. In a bathroom, Batora uses Water Release to scare them with red paint. Ran and Suzu flee. In the courtyard, Kawaki and Batora carry a statue of the Third Hokage, making it appear to move on its own. Himawari chases after it, and activating her Byakugan, sees it's Kawaki and Batora carrying it. She lets them go, pretending to the others she couldn't catch up. Kae returns to the main group, and Kawaki wonders why she's so committed to this. Batora explains that as heir, she was never able to act as a child, or play with friends and even her younger brother. He believes Kae is taking the opportunity to reclaim these experiences. Kawaki sympathises with the situation. When Kae returns, she notices his enthusiasm for continuing to scare the students. In the director's office, Iruka's portrait takes on a monstrous appearance, and a long tongue comes out of the frame. Everyone is scared, and Kura flees. Kae explains to Kawaki that while they're called Seven Mysteries, there are only six known mysteries, the nature of the seventh one also a mystery. Only Himawari, Eh\u014d, and Yuina remain to check on the next mystery, a mirror that drags those reflected on it to another world. A shrouded figures appears above them, but it's not Batora, who arrived late over organising the supply room. Eh\u014d and Yuina faint, and Kawaki attacks the figure, who dodges him and flees. Kae wants to uncover the figure's identity, and goes after it. Kawaki tells Himawari to take care of her friends, so he and Batora go after Kae. The mysteries they faked before all manifest for Kae, Kawaki, and Batora through the Academy. Kae thinks the mysteries are angry with them over being faked. They decide to check the faculty room, since none of the mysteries are associated with it. There, they find Shino, who gets covered in glowing pain, and explains that he was cleaning the faculty room. He doesn't know anything about mysteries, but determines that his insects were responsible, since Shino uses them to clean more effectively. The remaining students arrive, Yuina and Eh\u014d fleeing over thinking the glowing Shino is a ghost. Leaving the building, S\u014dsha wants to write about it in the school paper. The twins continue to tease each other. Kae asks Kawaki not to reveal what they did to Himawari.

Kawaki deduces Himawari discovered everything with her Byakugan, but she confesses she thought it was all real at first, and is glad Kae had so much fun.

Himawari is placed with Kae and S\u014dsha, Kawaki with Harika and Soul. Hana wants them to strengthen their team-work. On their way home, Himawari discusses Kawaki's mission with him, assuring him she'll look after Kae during the exercise. Kawaki doesn't fist bump her, and instead warns her not to let Kae find out about his mission. The next day, S\u014dsha and Himawari pick Kae to be team leader. Harika and Soul pick Kawaki as leader over being older. Hana says the best team will get a gift from her. Konashi tries talking to Kae, but changes his mind. Eiki and Osuka get into a rivalry over whose team is stronger. Hana warns everyone not to go too deep into the forest. The first is a Tree Climbing Practice relay race. Kawaki's focus on protecting Kae distracts him from performing for his team, who complain about it to him. Eiki's team with Suzu and Neon performs the best in this test. Kawaki also gets distracted during a shurikenjutsu test, Himawari's team placing first. They stop to make lunch. Instead of using sticks to make fire, Kande uses Lightning Release, impressing his team-mates. Hana gives them ingredients and a curry recipe to follow. Himawari has to pull Kawaki aside to explain Eiki has a crush on Kae when he misunderstands S\u014dsha's gossip. Harika pulls Kawaki back towards their team with her kikaich\u016b. Konashi continues to lurk around Kae. Soul and Harika complain about Kawaki not contributing, so Harika takes over as leader. They hand his curry, and tell him to focus on the afternoon tests. While cleaning up, Kae splits off from the group, so Himawari asks for Kawaki's help. Mimi gives Himawari directions she saw Kae take, and reminds her of Hana's warning about going deep into the forest. Kawaki finds Konashi blaming himself for something relating to Kae. Kae waits by a big tree, with a noting asking her to meet her for advice. Himawari finds her, but she's not the one who asked Kae to meet. Konashi was the one who asked her to meet, but fled when coming across a flame bear. He wanted to ask her opinion on his sweets for an upcoming competition, his family owning a sweets shop for generations, but was too shy to ask in front of everyone. Himawari and Kae run from the bear, and Hana acts as a decoy for them to escape, distracting the bear and attacking it with her Wind Release. Kawaki and Konashi finds Himawari and Kae, who inform them that Hana is fighting the bear. The bear's flames overcome Hana's Wind Release, and Kawaki arrives in time to kick the bear off of her, defeating it with one punch. He admonishes Hana for being unable to defeat the bear, and Konashi becomes star-struck by Kawaki, inspirited not to be embarrassed anymore. Meeting up with Kae's team, Konashi apologises for not showing up, and asks about his sweets. Kae gives them a positive critique. Soul and Harika overhear that Kawaki faced something head-on, and criticise him for always bailing on them. During the afternoon tests, Kawaki outperforms everyone else, changing his team-mates opinion of him. At the end of the day, Kae's team is the one with most points. Himawari is sad she didn't make a good team with Kawaki, but he concedes she did protect Kae. He instead complains about Hana. Konashi begins looking up to Kawaki.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "266", "Episode Title": "Himawari_Kidnapped!", "Japanese Airdate": "11 September 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Kawaki is assigned cleaning duty at the end of the day at the Academy. Himawari is going shopping with Kae, Batora overseeing them. Kawaki isn't concerned, as j\u014dnin watch Kae outside the Academy. Himawari tries talking to Osuka and Neon, but Osuka rebukes her. Two masked men watch them through the window. Neon apologises to Himawari, who doesn't mind. Neon's mother picks her up at the Academy. She and Osuka greet each other. She asks Osuka about her mother, but Osuka is unable to answer, Neon's mother believing Hibari is busy as usual. Osuka refuses her offer to walk her home. Himawari asks about Osuka and her mother, and apologises when it startles her. The masked men kidnap them, a sunflower pendant being left behind. The kidnappers argue about grabbing Himawari in addition to Osuka, and how that complicates ransoming her. Osuka doesn't believe her mother would pay a ransom. Their leader shows up. While leaving the Academy, Kawaki meets with Batora and Kae, who came looking for Himawari when she didn't show up. Kawaki finds it strange, and notices Himawari's pendant on the floor. He recalls that Himawari was with Osuka and Neon that time he saw her. Batora knows where Osuka lives, having researched places outside the Academy that Kae might visit. Aniki beats them up for getting an extra hostage. Himawari can tell that Aniki is a shinobi, and is confident he'll be found out, remaining calm. Aniki recognises her as the Seventh Hokage's daughter, and having delivered a ransom note to Osuka's residence, decides to sell Himawari to someone who has a grudge against the Hokage. Kawaki, Kae, and Batora arrive at Osuka's residence, where the servants read the ransom note. Kawaki snatches it, letting Kae read it. They realise Himawari might have been kidnapped alongside Osuka. Kae wants to check on Neon, and they tell Osuka's servants to contact her parents, who are on set of a new production. Himawari asks Osuka about her mother again, and Osuka says she doesn't care about her anymore, but refuses to elaborate. The kidnappers are concerned about capital punishment for kidnapping Himawari, but she assures them that Naruto wouldn't do that, and might forgive them if they apologise. They explain that they turned to crime because they can't eat, having failed out of the Academy and not lasting in any job. Aniki, who was a genin who ditched a mission he disagreed with, took them in. Aniki attacks a crate behind them, chastising them for giving up so much information, and telling Himawari to give up hope, as they're somewhere people rarely go. At Neon's home, they explain that Himawari and Osuka were likely kidnapped right after parting with her. Neon knew to leave her be when she was upset about her mother, who is an old friend of Neon's mother. Neon was asked to stay with Osuka so she wouldn't lonely over Hibari always being busy with work, but is actually friends with Osuka. Neon has an idea on how to find them. The kidnappers doze off, and Himawari convinces Osuka to attempt an escape. Himawari attacks Aniki, while Osuka ties the other kidnapper's legs. Aniki resists her attacks, and the kidnappers attempt to talk him down on hurting her. Osuka begs him to let Himawari go, reminding him she's the one he wants. Kawaki breaks through the ceiling, recovering the girls. Neon, Kae, and Batora catch up. Aniki creates a Fire Release wall around himself and Kawaki, and attacks him. Kawaki is unhurt by the Fire Release, and knocks him out. As the police work the scene, Kawaki returns Himawari's pendant. Himawari checks in on the other two kidnappers, and they ask about her injuries. She remains optimistic about them. Neon explains to Osuka she found them with her drone, and Hibari arrives to check in on her daughter, surprising her. Osuka thought she didn't care because she threw out something that was special to her. Neon explain that their mothers worked together to develop a sensing function for the drone, based on the Yamanaka clan's jutsu, to find her. Osuka and Hibari make up, the thing Hibari threw out being expired pudding. Hibari invites them all for pudding. Osuka apologises to everyone. Aniki curses his situation and at an unspecified superior who put him up to it. Meanwhile, a hooded individual is hidden in the trees while observing on Kae.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "267", "Episode Title": "Kawaki's_Cover_Blown?!", "Japanese Airdate": "18 September 2022", "episode synopsis text": "The class rehearses a play about the Sannin for an upcoming festival, in which Kawaki plays Katsuyu. Eiki, playing Jiraiya, mocks him. Kae, who plays Tsunade, is excited about it. Osuka, who's playing Orochimaru, feels she is better suited to play the Fourth Hokage, who everyone picked Himawari to play over being his granddaughter. Himawari praises Osuka's Orochimaru performance. To make their performances more convincing, Osuka asks everyone to bring a mock forehead protector. As they leave the Academy, another Konoha shinobi takes over watching Kae. The next day, S\u014dsha publishes a story about Eiki reading one of Jiraiya's Icha Icha books to learn about his role. Embarrassed, Eiki rips the stories S\u014dsha handed out. Everyone puts on their forehead protectors, but Himawari forgot to bring one. Kawaki offers her his, but she refuses and tells him to hide it, as it could expose him as a genin, specially if S\u014dsha finds out. Eiki sees and overhears them, and tells S\u014dsha. They speculate the motive behind it, Eiki believing it to be nefarious. S\u014dsha asks about what proof he has, and Eiki shows a note sent to him anonymously, which is why he has kept a close eye on Kawaki. S\u014dsha needs more convincing proof, so Eiki tells her he'll get her Kawaki's forehead protector, and she hopes it's real so she can get a big scoop. After more rehearsals, Kawaki checks on Kae, who wonders why Orochimaru chose a path that lead away from his friends, herself wishing to stay with her friends in the Academy. Kawaki comforts her, and she gets excited to resume rehearsals. After she leaves, Kawaki addresses a hidden Eiki, admonishing for still being after Kae, and threatening to beat him up for real. Unable to steal the forehead protector through conventional means, he decides to take advantage of Kawaki's role of Katsuyu. S\u014dsha surprises Kawaki and Himawari, asking them about his forehead protector. They leave without answering, and join everyone else checking on the set, built primarily by Neon with everyone's help. S\u014dsha brings her camera. In the rehearsal, Eh\u014d takes over the Jiraiya role, previously playing Manda, at Eiki's request, which Kawaki finds unusual. As they fight as Manda and Katsuyu, Eiki makes Kawaki drop his forehead protector, but he manages to hide it before S\u014dsha can photograph it, realising they're working together. Eiki improvises and gets Osuka to help him, improvising a Summoning: Rash\u014dmon. Eiki grabs the forehead protector, but stands on the half-finished set, causing it to collapse. Kawaki protects him and Kae, and Eiki rushes to to hand S\u014dsha the protector, but it turns out to be a mock one. S\u014dsha accuses him of trying to get to publish a fake story. Kawaki shows him how he destroyed the set. Eiki breaks down crying, as it wasn't his intent to ruin things for everyone. At Himawari's insistence, Kawaki reaches out to Eiki to fix the set, and is joined by Kae. Kawaki notices his actual forehead protector is still missing. Everyone helps fixing the set, Kawaki and Himawari stay late looking for his forehead protector. Osuka hands it to them, having looked out for them after overhearing Eiki and S\u014dsha, switching it out during the improvised Rash\u014dmon summoning. Osuka claims it's to repay for helping when she was kidnapped, suspecting he had to re-enrol due to bad behaviour. After they leave, Eiki approaches them to apologise again, and shows them the note he received, claiming that Kawaki is a shinobi with a secret that would get him expelled, now believing it to be a prank. Kawaki wonders who would want him expelled, and rushes to see Kae in the infirmary. Two Land of Bamboo officials discuss the country's succession, Kae's father plan to formally announce her as heir going against their plan to have her younger brother crowned. They decide to deploy an assassin. Kawaki reaches Kae just in time to stop an attempt, and the assassin escapes.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "268", "Episode Title": "Target:_The_School_Festival", "Japanese Airdate": "25 September 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Kae wakes up right after Kawaki fends off the assassin. He insists on walking her home, instead of reporting the attempt to the Hokage's office immediately, and decides to protect her on his own until the festival is over. The next day, the students prepare the Academy for the festival. Shino notes the students are putting a lot of effort into it, Hana wishing they'd put the same effort in class, feeling tired of having worked until late preparing for the festival. Back in the Jiraiya role, Eiki promises Kae to make up for earlier. Kawaki speculates that whoever tipped Eiki knows he's guarding Kae, and wonders if they also infiltrated the Academy. Himawari asks him about what happened in the infirmary, but he brushes it off, feeling the situation has gotten too dangerous for her to be involved. Teams 7, 10, 5, and 15 attend the Academy festival. Teams 7 and 10 are interested seeing Kawaki in the play, having heard he's playing a slug. Hana feels unwell, and agrees with Eh\u014d's suggestion that she should rest in the infirmary. Kawaki remains concerned.  Ch\u014dch\u014d praises Konashi's sweets, and offers criticism for improvement. Ran S\u014dgi and Suzu made use of their experience with the Seven Mysteries to make an effective haunted house attraction, which thoroughly scares Team 5. Neon and Harika comment on their use of drones and insects, and Denki promises to put in a good word about developing those technologies. At Mimi and Kura's booth, Boruto, Shikadai, Inojin, Sarada, and Tsubaki collect several prizes hitting targets with kunai, causing them to wonder if they should have banned shinobi from playing. Hibari finished all her scenes of the day early so she could watch Osuka's debut in the play. S\u014dsha takes their photo, preparing an album about the festival. Kawaki asks about Batora, but Kae says he had unavoidable business to attend, which Kawaki finds suspicious. Kawaki mistakes an attendee for the assassin he fended off. The assassin watches Kae in the festival from above. The start of the play is announced, and the audience take their seats. Kae is nervous because the play was a collective effort, and thanks Kawaki for helping her all along. An explosion is set off, and an anonymous note is delivered to the Academy. Until safety can be verified, everyone is to remain on Academy grounds. Academy staff discuss the threat, which includes detonating more bombs if anyone tries to leave or contact the outside. The former students offer to help deal with the situation. Kawaki wonders if the attack is a diversion to target Kae. Osuka decides to obey and stay put, while Eiki and Eh\u014d decide to help out. Inojin flies on a drawing, directing the shinobi to where there are explosive tags to be disarmed. Shino targets them through the ventilation system with his kikaich\u016b. Eiki and Eh\u014d find an explosive tag circuit behind the school building. Eiki stays behind to try defusing them while Eh\u014d rushes back to warn the students. Kawaki decides to go help Eiki, and tells Himawari to keep an eye on Kae. Eiki manages to defuse most of the circuit, but the main explosive tag has already started to burn. Kawaki removes it, and uses a shadow clone to take it as far above the building as he can, so it detonates without harming anyone. Inside the building, several smoke bombs go off, allowing an assassin to sneak near Kae. Recalling Kawaki's order, Himawari activates her Byakugan, and seeing through the smoke, knocks the assassin aside. Outside, Himawari tells Kae there was someone going after her. The assassin catches up, but so does Kawaki. Kawaki gives chase, but the assassin throws several explosive tag kunai to cover their escape. Kawaki finds Hana among the explosion debris, and feels guilty she was hurt when going to look for them after they left. Kae realises she was the target by how her father was acting, and based on Kawaki's reaction, asks if he was guarding her.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "269", "Episode Title": "The_Sneaking_Shadow", "Japanese Airdate": "2 October 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Hana's class visits her in the hospital after her injury in the attack on the festival, and wish her a swift recovery. Because of her injuries, her memories of the assailant are hazy. Kawaki is admonished by Shikamaru, Sai, and Naruto about failing to report his suspicion of an assassin, and is taken off the mission. The search for the assassin continues, and Kae is likely to return to the Land of Bamboo. Shino and Anko discuss the incident, and decide not to tell Hana about Kae being the target. Kae is heavily guarded, and Batora informs that her father asked for her return. She misses her friends, and feels that Kawaki only got close to her for his mission. K\u014dtar\u014d finishes interviewing Eiki, Kawaki, and Himawari about the incident. Himawari convinces Kawaki to keep protecting Kae, and continues to help herself, despite Kawaki finding it too dangerous for her. They decide to rely on Eiki for information, keeping that Kae was the target a secret. From what Eiki gathered, they have an idea where the culprit might have been, so they decide to look through S\u014dsha's photos. Batora tells Kae that Kawaki was likely forbidden from telling anyone about his mission, and speculates that he failed to report the assassin so as to prevent the festival Kae was looking forward to from being cancelled. Kae wants to ask him herself. S\u014dsha finds it strange that those three are working together, but relents when Eiki claims he's looking for a girl he has crush on. Looking through the photos, Himawari spots Batora on one of them, which is strange as he said he couldn't attend the festival. They keep it from Eiki and rush out, as Kae is with Batora. Kae finishes a letter, and the lights go out. Batora arrives at her room. Kawaki and Himawari arrive to find the Konoha guards knocked out. Kawaki spots Batora with a kunai, and breaks through the window. Batora has an injury caused the assassin. Kawaki chases the assassin, while Himawari protects Kae. The assassin attacks Kawaki with dark flames that chase him around. He dodges them, and beats the assassin down. Before he can discover their identity, the assassin reveals explosive tags around their body, and detonates them. After the police process the scene, K\u014dtar\u014d asks Kawaki about his presence, and he claims he was visiting a friend. He'll report this to the Hokage's office. Kawaki checks on Kae, who's bandaging Batora. He asks why he was at the festival, and he says he was investigating someone suspicious who might have sneaked into the village. He lost track of them at the Academy. Batora feels indebted to Kae's father for taking him in. Batora and Himawari point out Kawaki's concern for Kae on what he does and does not do. The next day, Eiki asks about where they went, and S\u014dsha publishes a story about Eiki's new crush. Naruto reports that they'll overlook Kawaki's failure on account of his protecting Kae, though her father has withdrawn the mission, the plot's mastermind having been arrested back at the Land of Bamboo, after communications were discovered based on evidence Batora uncovered. It was the minister and guardian of Kae's younger stepbrother. They seemingly got into Konoha around the same time Kae arrived. The Land of Bamboo wants Konoha to send them all the information to avoid other nations learning of their infighting.

Kawaki messes up the release of flower petals for a surprise, Hana thanks them for caring about her and apologises for her shortcomings as their teacher. At the end of the day, Hana recalls what Shino and Anko told her of the assassination plot against Kae, and checking on the places she was during the festival, feels guilty about never perceiving the danger. She struggles to remember what she was doing and how she got caught in the blast. Kawaki arrives, and Hana recovers memories of fighting him and being the assassin after Kae. She excuses herself, and recovers more memories of fighting Kawaki. Hana rummages through her apartment, and discovers a hidden room with the assassin's belongings. Realising the truth, she decides to turn herself in, but her alter, speaking to her through her reflection won't allow it. Hana's alter recalls her that she is a Land of Bamboo orphan raised by its minister as a personal assassin, the one remaining of a group of around 50, having had to kill her friends in the training process. Her desire to survive clashed so much with her desire against killing that her mind split. As the survivor, she was assigned the mission by the Bamboo minister, who has sent agents like her to various countries, her desire to be a teacher actually an order by the minister her alter caused her to want. Hana's alter was responsible for the kidnapping, wanting to gauge Kawaki's strength. She used an associate's corpse to fake the assassin being killed during the attack. After all her trouble, Hana's alter won't let her turn herself in now that the matter is considered closed, and she is firmly established as a teacher who cares deeply about her students. Hana's alter takes over, and she wakes up. Himawari calls Kawaki for dinner, and he reveals his intent to keep investigating, finding it strange that the assassin had set up the explosive tags on themselves, anticipating defeat, when having fought them, Kawaki found them incredibly skilled.

She warns them to be careful of the unmaintained island. The students thank her for arranging it to make up for the festival. Mimi's ninken Kikuchiyo gets hurt on a trap. S\u014dsha heard a rumour that the island is a home of a killer missing-nin, worrying everyone. Kawaki is suspicious that the trap isn't old, and that people on the island wouldn't manage to stay hidden for long. Hana says that the island has a history of people escaping to it, some not even knowing the war is over. Their food is suddenly gone as well, and the ship will only return to them the next day. Hana blames herself, but Himawari assures her they can manage. Everyone starts setting up tents and looking for food. Kawaki is still bothered by the trap. Hana finds them lucky, and would have killed them all if she didn't still have a mission. Osuka finds a game trail leading to edible wild plants, making use of what she learned when she lived in a mountain with her mother for a movie. Kae makes a flower arrangement for Hana. Kawaki wants her to stay close, and she asks if he's still guarding her, as the matter of her assassin is over. When they get startled by some movement, Osuka and Himawari have Neon check it with her drone, but it gets taken down. They ask for help, and Soul finds it. Neon finds it unlikely to have malfunctioned, having recently serviced it. They worry about missing-nin. Hana watches them, hidden. Kae gifts Hana the flower arrangement. Himawari calls her and everyone is informed about the drone incident. Doseki and Soul want to search the island, having a numbers advantage, but Kawaki points out that with the ninken and the drone out, they can't search far, as Harika's kikaich\u016b also can't search too wide an area. Hana tries calming everyone, and Kawaki stresses they must stay close together and in line of sight. At night, everyone eats. Kawaki checks on the trap, and tells Kae that according to Mimi, it was baited with Kikuchiyo's food, meaning he was the target from the start. Kae thanks for still watching over her, and he admits that going to the Academy has been fun as well. Kae has had fun as well, and reveals she'll return to the Land of Bamboo after this extra curricular class. Konashi gives Kae his latest sweet, and pulls Kawaki away to try some as well. Hana approaches her, who notices the flower arrangement is gone, and offers to help Hana look for it. Kawaki asks Himawari about the damage to the drone, and she found that its blades were cleanly sliced, and the drone too damaged for the height from which it fell. Himawari recalls that the drone has recording capabilities, so they have Neon play it to review the footage. Kawaki notices something and calls Himawari aside. He saw Wind Release flower petals on the corner of the screen before the footage cut off, and they realise it implicates Hana. They don't want to believe it, but too many things fit the theory. Himawari finds the flower arrangement Kae made discarded. Hana tries getting Kae further away from the group to find the gift, but Kawaki and Himawari stop them, wanting to ask questions. Hana sets off a smoke bomb and runs away with Kae. Hana fights Kawaki and Himawari, who thinks someone switched places with her.

The other students point out that without Kikuchiyo and Neon's drone, they wouldn't be able to search for them. Osuka suggests Hana actually means to use Kae as a hostage. Himawari attempts to look for them with her Byakugan, but doesn't have enough stamina left. Despite the danger, the class wants to save Kae. Hidden in a cave, Kae struggles against her restraints and asks Hana why she's doing it. She tells Kae she's meeting associates, and orders her to be quiet. Kae tries convincing Hana to go back, to no avail, Hana landing a kunai near head. Hana explains she was embedded in the village for missions like this.

The class wants to finish the play they rehearsed, but Kawaki is no longer there to play Katsuyu. They arrange for Neon's drone to act as Katsuyu, but Kawaki arrives in time to play the part. The students and Hana see Kae off at the train station, except for Kawaki. She waves at them from the back of the train, and spots Kawaki by himself on a railing. She wishes him good luck on his missions, and thanks him for their time together. Later, Himawari goes off to the Academy, her parents noting how engrossed by it she's become. By himself, Kawaki smiles at his class photo.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "274", "Episode Title": "A_Flightless_Hawk", "Japanese Airdate": "6 November 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Sakura informs Sarada that Sasuke is taking Boruto with him to look for a replacement messenger hawk. She advises Sarada to get used to Sasuke leaving and returning suddenly. On the train, Sasuke explains the type of hawk he's after, tended to by a man named Maruta. Another passenger informs them that a detour will be required because of a recent landslide. Sasuke and Boruto hop off the train, continuing their journey on foot. Near a structure with extravagant buildings, the two are accosted by a security officer with a wolf, who finds them suspicious. Sasuke claims they're just passing through, and they leave. They arrive at Maruta's research facility, where he initially attacks them, confusing them for Paradise representatives, whose leader Mozu Shitakiri deals in exotic and endangered animals. They've began threatening him to learn about the Thousand Mile Hawk's habitat, and can't risk them finding out about it by tailing them if he takes Sasuke and Boruto there. Sasuke wants to investigate, and enters Paradise claiming to be a customer. Mozu initially intends to send them away, but changes her mind when Boruto recognises Tent\u014d in a photo. She takes them to see their pens, and berates her son, who took it upon himself to clean the stables when no one else would, for showing up filthy in front of customers. When Sasuke asks about their security, Mozu demonstrates their security system, confident in its ability to stop thieves. When Mozu explains an empty cage is for a Thousand Mile Hawk she means to acquire, Boruto accuses her of threatening Maruta. Realising they're not customers, she tells them to send Maruta a veiled threat on her behalf. Sasuke is worried about Boruto wanting to meddle. Mozu tells the security officer to deal with the shinobi. At night, Maruta takes Sasuke, who throws the security officer following them off their trail with crows, to the habitat. In the morning, Boruto spots Tsuzura training a white hawk. He introduces himself, and Tsuzura explains that Yuki trusts him because they've been together since she was young, but captivity made it hard for her to get food on her own, so he takes her out to get her used to it. Boruto helps by stirring up critters for Yuki to hunt. Yuki doesn't fly well because of an injury sustained when she fell from her nest. Boruto gets a book on hawks from Maruta's research facility so Tsuzura can learn, but his mother never thought him to read, so Boruto reads it for him. Mozu wants him to take over the business, but he dislikes how she treats the animals. Boruto relates to feeling pressure over a parent's job. Boruto decides to teach Tsuzura to read. He asks his mother to go to school, but she finds it too expensive, and they'd teach him things she feels he doesn't need to know. Mozu sends him to his room. Tsuzura exchanges notes with Boruto through Yuki. Sasuke and Maruta arrive at the hawk habitat. Maruta has given them the necessary training, but they must accept Sasuke. One of the hawks immediately accepts Sasuke, landing on his arm, surprising Maruta. With Boruto's help, Tsuzura successfully has Yuki capture prey. Mozu arrives with the security officer, and blaming Boruto for giving Tsuzura ideas, takes Yuki away and decides to restrict his freedom even further. The security officer threats to arrest him, but Tsuzura deescalates the situation, leaving with his mother.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "275", "Episode Title": "Into_the_Sky_Again", "Japanese Airdate": "13 November 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Mozu cages Yuki despite Tsuzura's protests, wishing to sell her. Tsuzura doesn't care about an animal's rarity, and Mozu says this is because he hasn't experienced hardship, recounting how in her past, she was neglected until she discovered a marten thought to be extinct, which earned her recognition. She has since worn it around her neck, and hopes Tsuzura will one day understand their value. Sasuke and Maruta return with a new hawk, and are welcomed by Boruto. He tells Sasuke of what he has learned about Tsuzura and his home life, and wishes Tsuzura could have a say in his own life. Sasuke shares his opinion of Paradise, but is unwilling to interfere at the moment, thinking Tsuzura has to realise it on his own. The next day, Mozu keeps Tsuzura locked in his room, and tells him she found a client who wants to stuff and mount Yuki, to match his living room wall. Seeing Boruto's message on the paper, Tsuzura sneaks off to get Yuki. Sasuke notes Boruto's displeasure at leaving. They're approached by a subordinate of Yuki's buyer, asking for directions. Upon learning the buyer is a taxidermist, Boruto rushes out, followed by Sasuke. Mozu goes to check on Yuki, finding her gone, Tsuzura having taken her. She finds them on their way out, and threatens him to return Yuki. She has the security officer chase him with his wolf. Right outside Paradise, Boruto protects Tsuzura, and Sasuke intimidates the wolf. Mozu threatens Boruto with life in prison if he steps in Paradise again. Sasuke offers his Thousand Mile Hawk in exchange for Yuki, to Boruto's surprise. Mozu takes the deal, and is certain that Tsuzura will return after struggling in the real world. The security officer wants to see them to the train station to make sure they don't return. The Thousand Mile Hawk goes in distress. An employee wants to take care of the valuable bird, but Mozu orders to have it opened up, wishing to learn its stomach contents to determine its habitat. On his way out, Boruto tries to comfort Tsuzura, who concedes that his mother is right this is the only home he's ever known, pointing out how Sasuke gave up his hawk. Sasuke tells him not to worry about it. Sasuke's hawk recovers and escapes, Sasuke having used his Sharingan to command it to wreck havoc. The security officer recognises Sasuke's name when Boruto praises him. Mozu catches up, telling Tsuzura she'll forgive him if he brings her Sasuke's hawk. Tsuzura refuses to return home. Mozu threatens to destroy them with her connections, but the security officer, now aware of Sasuke's identity, tells her he's out of her league. The animals she kept escape. Tsuzura is concerned about his future, but Sasuke reassures him. Maruta takes on Tsuzura as an apprentice. Sasuke wants Boruto to return to Konoha by himself, so that his actions against Mozu don't reflect on the village. He already meant to leave to look for Kara's last member, Code. He says Sarada will understand when Boruto asks if she knows, and Boruto reiterates his desire to become a shinobi like him. On the train, Boruto struggles with a stuck window, and is helped by an Iwa shinobi. A man rushes to get on the train before it departs. When everyone is asleep, the train changes course. When Boruto wakes up, everyone is detained on a featureless room with bunk beds.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "276", "Episode Title": "Welcome_to_the_Maze", "Japanese Airdate": "20 November 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto doesn't recognise his surroundings when he wakes up. He exchanges words with Kiri bounty hunter Anaguma, and asks about an exit. Anaguma points him to a Fire Release user, who has been trying to break out for a while with no result, and accidentally hits Shamo, an Iwa shinobi as he approaches. Boruto checks on him, and Kiseru recognises Boruto, also a Konoha shinobi and an acquaintance of Konohamaru. A girl asks about Anaguma's bounty, Rokuro, who she thinks smells of blood. Anaguma tells her to be careful. An old man arrives, congratulating them on surviving, claiming that a drug storage facility along the tracks of their Thunder Train exploded, exposing them to toxic gas, requiring them to be taken to a containment facility in case they were contaminated. A Kumo kunoichi has no recollection of it, but the old man blames it on the gas, claiming that many passengers died over inhaling too much of the gas. Before letting them go, the man wants them to go through a test, believing that the choices they just happened to make that allowed to survive were not coincidences, but a subconscious ability to avoid death. He wishes to test that ability, and offers a card-drawing test. Kiseru feels confident, but Boruto finds it suspicious. Another Kiri bounty hunter draws a death card, and is killed by the old man with a blade extending from his finger. Boruto attacks the old man with Wind Release: Gale Palm. Kiseru calls Boruto to inspect the old man, revealed to be a puppet. \u014cga introduces himself as the lord of the maze, and explains that the experiment isn't a game, and his is an underground maze unknown to all but him. He ignores Boruto's admonishment and proceeds explaining there will be five experiments, detailed in scrolls he presents them. If they don't pass all the experiments, they'll never leave the maze. A Kusa shinobi complains about it, knocking over one of the scrolls, selecting an experiment by accident. The scrolls summons them to a different location. The Kumo kunoichi wants a civilian to spend what she presumes to be money he has on a briefcase he's holding tightly to hire her, finding him unlikely to survive on his own. Kiseru criticises the Kusa shinobi, who pushes him back. Boruto stops Shamo from falling when the stone floor near the edge of the platform they're on collapses. Yatsume introduces herself to Boruto. Another section of the floor collapses near an old man. \u014cga explains they have to leave the brittle platform and reach another platform above them. Boruto and Kiseru rush and attempt to attack \u014cga, but he disappears. The brittle platform continues to collapse, and the man with the briefcase accepts help from the Kumo kunoichi, who uses a powerful Wind Release to lift them to the firm platform. A participant warns her that such a strong jutsu will collapse the platform, and she is unbothered by his accusation of caring only for herself. The Kusa shinobi also jumps to safety. The platform continues to collapse, some participants falling. Anaguma attempts to hold it together with Water Release threads. Rokuro says he won't be able to hold it alone. Yatsume is exasperated when Boruto jumps back down to help the old man, while the Kumo kunoichi finds him naive. Kiseru uses the firm platform's fence to make a rope ladder for everyone else to climb, but can only support one person at once. Shamo helps a young girl who sprained her ankle. Anaguma warns Boruto his jutsu won't hold for long. A man loses his patience when the platform continues to give while an old couple takes too long to climb. The rest of the threads give away, throwing Anaguma off the edge. Rokuro holds him with his legs, and asks civilian Kakesu to tap Anaguma's keys on his cuff to release him so he can use his jutsu to save her. Anaguma urges her not to trust him. She releases Rokuro, who lets Anaguma fall, and ignores Kakesu when the floor under her collapses. He has a bladed arm. The man and the old man fall as more of the platform collapses. Boruto asks Namua to help a woman, while he carries the girl with the sprained ankle. Shamo asks for help as Boruto reaches the top. Boruto manages to grab him as the rest of the platform collapses and Boruto Streams himself and Shamo up, Yatsume grabbing them at the bottom of the ladder. \u014cga allows them to rest before the next experiment, and they return to original room. Boruto criticises Rokuro for sacrificing Anaguma, but he's determined to survive, even at the expense of everyone else. The Kumo kunoichi notes there were 14 survivors. Boruto wants to survive to capture \u014cga.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "277", "Episode Title": "Disappearing_Lives", "Japanese Airdate": "27 November 2022", "episode synopsis text": "The captives wait for \u014cga to announce the next experiment. A few complain of thirst, Fug\u014d trying in vain to exchange his luxury watch for another captive's water. The Kusa-nin agrees with Boruto that they need to cooperate to survive. Batta continues to only care about getting payed, and Yatsume finds merit in both approaches, asking Rokuro's opinion. He thinks they need a strong will to survive throws a parasite on the Kusa-nin to force him to confess, accusing him of being \u014cga's minion, as he activated the first experiment, and avoided the platform edges before they started crumbling. He grabs another captive and asks for \u014cga's help before perishing. Rokuro picks another scroll, finding it useless to hesitate. It takes them do a dark room, where a candle lights up on its own when Yatsume grabs it. They all grab candles, which also light up. They're supposed to reach a goal, avoiding many traps, without letting their flame die. An older captive sneezes, blowing out his candle, and dies. \u014cga explains the candle flame is their life, showing them lanterns to carry them. He adds how passing the candles from person to person works, the person not holding a candle dying if one goes out on someone else's hand. The candle belongs to whoever holds it. Sarada and Mitsuki look for the Thunder Train Boruto disappeared on, asking the company's staff about it. The Department of Prisons also made inquiries, and the employee working that day suddenly quit and went away. A train employee spies on them as they discuss Boruto's disappearance. They hear a snap and find money on the floor. The suspicious employee escapes, but later despairs at what he got involved in. The captives have to wade through water, Batta, Fug\u014d, and Rokuro going first. Shamo carries a girl he likes on his arms. They reach a closing gate that requires both hands for raising. Kiseru is concerned \u014cga has other minions among them. Batta is interested in the commotion, and offers to carry Fug\u014d's briefcase so he can hold his lantern with both hands, promising not to steal it, but he refuses. Boruto trusts Yatsume with his lantern, but is unable to raise the gate until Kiseru and Namua help him. Yatsume finds him odd. They reach a desert like area where trash is being burned, where fans begin blowing a dust storm. Boruto has the non-shinobi hold the candles, while the shinobi form a shield. Shamo creates an earth wall, but it's too weak and crumbles at Boruto's touch. They protect the non-shinobi from the storm with their bodies. When it passes, they're all alive. An old lady offers Boruto her water as thanks. He notices that Shamo and the girl with him aren't around, Kiseru saying they went ahead. Shamo helps her up a wall, but she leaves him behind as another dust storm kicks up around him. The old lady dies, her candle having melted completely. The heat of the area melted her candle, making it go out. They find Shamo abandoned as they reach the end, and catch up with the others, the girl now clinging to Rokuro. \u014cga appears and offers a bonus stage, claiming that the elevator the first group is on will take them to the goal, but only has two more spots on it. Two civilians rush to fill it, and it closes. The others go into the second elevator. They notice it is moving too slowly, and the candles will be used up before they reach the top. Kiseru realises that the candle holding rules mean that taking and preserving stolen candles will increase their remaining time, but others would have to die. On the other elevator, Rokuro blows out the girl's candle, taking it for himself. Fug\u014d wants Batta to steal the other civilians' candles so they can last. She hands him her lantern and makes their way to them. Boruto notices melted wax on the floor from his and Yatsume's candle. He recalls the rule that the candle belongs to whoever holds it, and suggests making one long candle they all hold on to. From the first elevator, only Rokuro, Batta, and Fug\u014d came out alive. Batta is shaken, with blood on her hand holding a candle. When everyone from the second elevator appears alive, \u014cga is amused by their ingenuity, and they're all transported back to the waiting room. Mitsuki and Sarada chase the train employee, and find where the Thunder Train changed tracks. He screams that the passengers became part of experiments, and runs into the tunnel, triggering explosive tags which collapse the tunnel on top of him, to Sarada's and Mitsuki's shock.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "278", "Episode Title": "Musical_Chairs", "Japanese Airdate": "4 December 2022", "episode synopsis text": "While waiting for the next experiment, Batta struggles with having killed civilians for hers and Fug\u014d's survival, and rebuffs Yatsume's attempt to comfort her. She also clashes with Shamo, and chides Boruto when he tries convincing her of the importance of cooperation. Kiseru doesn't judge her, but warns against trying anything against him, showing off his Fire Release. She mocks him for showing his hand, Namua and Boruto having to calm him down. Yatsume shares her dream of finally changing her hair colour if she survives, and asks for others dreams. Boruto wants to emulate his master. Shamo wants to make his grandmother happy. Namua has no dreams, and Rokuro recognises the tattoo on his arm as a prison tattoo. Namua recounts his criminal past, having killed and stolen so much he became paranoid about becoming the next victim. He changed his life after meeting a priest he couldn't bring himself to kill, becoming an ascetic. Fug\u014d wants to deliver a payment to his client, his company's fate at stake. Batta refuses to share her story, but Yatsume notes her use of \"need\" instead of \"want\" when she mentions money, so she claims she needs money to buy a beach island. Kiseru wants to soak on hot spring on his mountain village, near the border with Takigakure. \u014cga arrives, and Kiseru picks the next experiment, \"Pressure\", which \u014cga finds the harshest yet. Sarada returns to Konoha, meeting with Kawaki, Mitsuki having stayed behind to investigate the scene. She is investigating everyone who bought tickets to the same Thunder Train to see if anyone suspicious was aboard with Boruto. Namua finds bloodstains on the experiment room, agitating Shamo, which irritates Kiseru. Shamo finds and presses a switch causing the ceiling to come down on them. Yatsume readily tries blocking it with her Lightning Release chains, but they break. Boruto's Rasengan also has no effect. Rokuro asks what Shamo did, and he explains he tried turning on the lights. Boruto notices other switches on other walls, but each one pressed makes the situation worse, causing moving saws and spikes to appear. One of them retracts the saws, but the ceiling spikes remain. Batta and Fug\u014d argue against pressing the last switch, but taking \u014cga's behaviour in consideration, Boruto thinks he wouldn't end them like this, and presses it. Depressions appear on the walls, where they can hide from the ceiling spikes. Fug\u014d overtakes Shamo, Rokuro fights Kiseru, Boruto lets Yatsume have one spot, as thanks for saving him in the first experiment and because she injured herself when her jutsu failed to stop the ceiling. Namua observes the ceiling. Kiseru's Fire Release endangers the others, but Boruto puts it out with his Water Release. He notices the water drains away, and determines there must be space below the floor. Boruto and Kiseru try breaking through the floor, while Shame tries holding the ceiling with his earth wall. Namua joins Boruto and Kiseru. Batta needs to kill Yatsume to take her spot, who wants to know the reason for her death if Batta indeed kills her. Batta confesses she needs the money to buy back her birthplace from rich people who bought it for resort development. Boruto convinces her to help by arguing it'll go against playing into \u014cga's hand. She helps Boruto find the weakest spot on the floor for Boruto to strike, comparing it to diamond cutting. The extra space is enough so no one dies from the ceiling coming down. \u014cga congratulates Boruto, as it'll make the next experiment more interesting, and lets them return to the break room. Batta bumps into Kiseru as he leaves. Fug\u014d checks on his briefcase contents, not money, but a family photo and a canteen. Batta confides in Boruto that \u014cga might have another minion among them, revealing a working communication device she swiped from someone else, who kept it hidden instead of trying to use to contact anyone outside. He is surprised when she whispers who had it. Sarada discovered five passengers with unclear backgrounds, and comparing it to Konoha's records, she and Kawaki discover one of them was a Kara Outer, Kiseru.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "279", "Episode Title": "Barrier_of_Seven", "Japanese Airdate": "11 December 2022", "episode synopsis text": "Boruto is surprised when Batta accuses Kiseru of working for \u014cga. She explains that her home village is near Kiseru's alleged home, and that his claim of watching sunsets on hot springs is impossible because they all face east, allowing only sunrises. His claim made her suspicious, so she searched him and found the communication device. In the waiting room, Yatsume, Kiseru, and Shamo note how Boruto and Batta are taking their time coming back, and wonder if they're plotting. Batta believes that Kiseru has been receiving instructions to keep the experiments running smoothly, and points out they already found an underling before. Boruto remains sceptical, as Kiseru was the first to help him try breaking through the floor. Batta says she'll remain on guard. Kawaki is surprised Konoha has that much information on an Outer, but Sarada points out their information is likely incomplete, and that they're important clues about Code. They rush to meet up with Mitsuki. When Batta and Boruto return, \u014cga complains about them being late, the next experiment has already been picked, \"Calculation\". Everyone had to pick an envelope, Shamo picking theirs for them. \u014cga sends them to the next experiment, everyone scattered, with cards having numbers 1 to 8, and they have to steal each others' cards until they add up at least to 7, the ones who already have enough points being lucky, but also more likely to be targeted. They have a two hour limit to gather points and reach a gate indicated by a flare. Other flares will be sent to indicate one hour, and ten minutes remaining. Boruto has 6, Rokuro has 1. Batta finds Fug\u014d, who has 2, revealing she has 3. She wants to target Shamo, perceiving him as the weakest, who celebrates having 8. He shows it to Boruto, who admonishes him for his carelessness. Kiseru has 7, and decides to contact someone, but realises his communication device is gone, and that Batta took it when she bumped on him. Fug\u014d finds it strange Batta is still protecting him, despite her hate for the wealthy. She claims not to let personal feelings interfere with her mission. When he trips, she picks up his briefcase to return it to him, and finds it suspiciously light. Noting she never actually saw the money, the two fight over it, its contents falling out. The canteen breaks, something gaseous escaping it. She demands an explanation. Fug\u014d reveals his company is being threatened by an organisation, who have taken his wive and child hostage for ransom. However, his company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and he intended to threaten the organisation with the chemical on the canteen. She finds him just another liar, and takes his card, while he begs for her help. She tells him to pay him, and someone kills him with a kunai to the back. She is surprised by the assailant, who also attacks her. Yatsume has 4, and meets up with Namua, who has done the math, determining five people can have 7 or more points, meaning three people will fail. He offers her his 5 card, but she doesn't want it. Namua doesn't want to take things anymore, still hearing the voices of those he killed, and has trouble sleeping. Boruto and Shamo join up with them, and they check to see how many would pass with their cards. Shamo suggests turning Boruto's 6 into a 9, but he doesn't think it would work. They decide to look for the others, and find Batta and Fug\u014d dead on the ground, their cards and the device she took for Kiseru stolen. Namua thinks either Rokuro or Kiseru did it, while Boruto thinks it might be a trap to sow discord among them. Shamo wishes he could give them one of his points, giving Boruto the idea of exchanging his 6 card for the 1, 2, and 3, so more people could get 7 points. The one hour flare goes up. Rokuro finds them, revealing he has cards 1, 2, and 3. Boruto offers to exchange his 6 for 2 and 3, but Rokuro attacks him with his bladed arms, figuring that if only one person is left, \u014cga will reach the goal of his experiment early, going beyond his expectations. He takes Shamo hostage, who offers him his 8. Boruto lands a Vanishing Rasengan, allowing Shamo to escape and Namua to land a blow. Sarada and Kawaki finds Mitsuki trapped by sealing tags, with more around to trap them if they interfere. Sarada wants to wait for backup, but Kawaki goes ahead and triggers the trap, waiting for it envelop him so he can burn through it by setting himself on fire, also freeing Mitsuki. He reveals he was attacked by a group of skilled shinobi. Sarada informs him there might be Outer involvement. Kawaki wants to go straight to the source, Sarada in agreement. Shamo realises that if they get Rokuro's cards, them four can make through the experiment. Rokuro resists Boruto's Lightning Release and infects Namua with his parasite, making him fight against the group. He tries resisting Rokuro's control, who wishes Namua to revert to who he was before. Yatsume cries, touched by everyone's desire to survive. Seeing the kindness of the priest's eyes in Boruto, Namua manages to stop, and takes Rokuro's attack aimed at Boruto, who instead lands his Rasengan on him, defeating Rokuro and taking his cards. Rokuro has no regrets, as if he had been taken back to his village, he would have served for life at best, and concedes that Boruto's desire to survive was greater than his own. Boruto lets him have the 6 and 1 cards, and yells in defiance of \u014cga's goal. Rokuro reveals that while he took Batta and Fug\u014d's cards, they were already dead when he found them, leaving one possible culprit. Rokuro goes through the gate, and Boruto wants the others to go ahead, noting that the 7 card hasn't been used, so he wants to wait for Kiseru, telling the others of Batta's suspicion. Yatsume and Shamo help Namua through the gate. Kiseru arrives at the gate, finding Boruto waiting.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "280", "Episode Title": "Breakthrough", "Japanese Airdate": "18 December 2022", "episode synopsis text": "With the entire area set ablaze from the attack on Obito, Sasuke and Naruto watch, wondering if their attack was successful.

Yatsume and Rokuro also wake up, Boruto confirming to Rokuro that Kiseru wasn't working for \u014cga, but in fact investigating him. Something about the pain when Kiseru stabbed him was different, which he attributes to it being genjutsu. Rokuro speculates that the people who died in the genjutsu can't wake up, and doesn't believe they can beat \u014cga in an unfamiliar location. Yatsume retrieves a map and access card from the Kusa-nin who worked for \u014cga, which they use to leave the area and search for an exit. Yatsume falls down, dizzy. Rokuro doesn't want her dragging them down, and asks for the map. She refuses, thinking he wants to escape by himself, and carries own. They continued through abandoned rooms, and Rokuro notices them walking on the same puddle they did earlier, realising they're going in circles. A wall comes down, separating Boruto from the other two. Yatsume refuses giving the map to Rokuro again. Boruto fails to break through the wall with his Rasengan and tries to circle back. Yatsume prepares to attack with Lightning Release, Rokuro changes his arms into blades, and sends a parasite at her. Boruto arrives to find Yatsume defeated, and she tells him Rokuro took the map. He finds a closed gate and uses the access card to go through, finding an \u014cga puppet, which attacks him. Boruto helps Yatsume walk. She tells him she paralysed the insect with Lightning Release, but he'll be in danger when it wears off. They reach a more open area, and the parasite begins taking over Yatsume, causing her to attack Boruto, slashing his leg. She asks him to end it before she loses control. He allows her to stab his hand, and from how the pain feels, determines they're still under genjutsu, so they can still be saved. The infection on Yatsume recedes, and her attitude changes, commenting on what she wanted to see Boruto do. Her appearance changes to a cloaked, long-haired version of herself, revealing herself as \u014cga, using the old puppet as a distraction. He accuses her of killing Batta, which she admits she did to cast doubt on Kiseru so she could continue with the experiments. She wants to understand people's true desires, devising the scenarios to force people to act on them. She learned that desire is connected to one's life-force from someone who wanted to live so much he would steal others' bodies, but he was defeated anyway. Boruto realises she's talking about Jigen, and she reveals herself as Kara's eighth Inner, created by Amado. Boruto recognises their location as the place he saw when Amado was being interrogated. Because Kiseru almost broke her genjutsu, she had to quickly make a new one. Since they're still under it, Boruto asks about everyone else. She shows Boruto everyone in suspended animation, saying that she's not a combat type person, only her brain being augmented by Amado so she could assist his research on the human heart when he hit a dead end. She had to flee when she attempted to examine Jigen's heart, but before she could, he destroyed an important part of her body. It destroyed something in her heart, she no longer understands the reason for living, and her body began to whither. She thought that if she saw everyone trying so desperately to stay alive, it would restore her desire to live. She finds his desire different from others', and thinks she might have succeeded if he didn't figure it out. He finds her actions unforgivable, and she sits down, tired from talking so much. She explains that stabbing her will release the genjutsu and he will wake up. \u014cga also asks him to remove a scroll she indicates on the screen, so everyone else will wake up. She compares the situation to the fifth experiment. He deduces that if he leaves, she has no way of waking up, hence her request. \u014cga thinks it's too late for her. Boruto thinks she can wake up and remove the scroll herself, and offers to find her a reason to live. The world around begins to collapse. He runs around, trying to escape, pulling her along, and Boruto Streams himself carrying her through a gate. From the experiments, \u014cga thinks that when desires collide, unhappiness follows, but Boruto says he doesn't live for desires, but for dreams, and tells her to find a dream that stirs her heart. The ground collapses under her, and Boruto makes a clone chain to reach her, but she has to reach back. Reaching for Boruto is enough to make her wake up in reality, where she struggles to move. Sarada disagrees with the investigating team wanting to withdraw to think of another strategy, despite there being no contact from Kiseru. She says that if they leave, Kiseru won't be able to contact them. Kawaki points out she's begging them to reconsider. Mitsuki grabs one of the communication devices, and Boruto's voice comes through. He says he's somewhere in the mountains. Sarada yells at him. Boruto looks down at everyone who woke up, determine to continue living. Rokuro is still in custody, Kiseru finds his friend. Batta gives Fug\u014d a discount because his family is struggling. Shamo finds Boruto, asks about Yatsume, and gives him a letter he found addressed to him. It's from \u014cga, telling him she found a dream, and tries to have him guess it, promising to visit him one day. Boruto teases Shamo telling him it's a letter from \u014cga, and refusing to show him.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "282", "Episode Title": "Sasuke_Retsuden:_Infiltration", "Japanese Airdate": "8 January 2023", "episode synopsis text": "Near the Land of Redaku, Sasuke overhears a pair of women discussing a wedding ring, recalling being told of the custom. He sends a messenger hawk, expending his search for intel on Code, returning to the Land of Redaku for the first time since Naruto was afflicted with an illness years prior. Kurama had shared with Naruto that the Sage of Six Paths suffered from the same illness. Looking through their records, they discovered the Sage recovered while visiting the Astronomy Research Institute in the Land of Redaku. Kakashi was sent to investigate, as the Land of Fire doesn't have diplomatic relations, but the situation is precarious, with the country suffering from famine, and their prime minister having taken power after the death of their king. He had become a tutor to Prince Nanara, using the opportunity to search through their records for more information. The prince couldn't read or write, so Kakashi had to teach him before tutoring him could lead to any intel. Sasuke decided to investigate on his own, Naruto too weak to stop him. He infiltrated the institute as a prisoner, the institute now functioning as a prison, to look for records of how the Sage recovered from the illness. Sasuke was introduced to his cell-mates, learning their names and sentences, and defended himself when other inmates attacked him. A couple guards try to discipline him, but director Zans\u016bru points out everything Sasuke did was in self-defence. He advises Sasuke not to do anything too conspicuous. One of the inmates attempts to use the commotion to escape, but is killed by Men\u014d. The prisoners watch as Men\u014d devours the prisoner. The prisoners work while Men\u014d patrols the area. In his cell at night, Sasuke refuses to gamble at first, thinking about Men\u014d, but changes his mind, wanting a favour instead. He uses ninjutsu to win with dice, and wants Jiji to distract the guards if they patrol the area while he looks around. Jiji doesn't want to do it, but Sasuke leaves. He needs freedom to look for records on the Sage, and Men\u014d is in the way. Sasuke thinks Men\u014d is Zans\u016bru's summon, but his permanence is unusual. Men\u014d attacks Sasuke, immune to his genjutsu, who is forced to fight back. He is concerned with leaving evidence of a battle, but has to slash Men\u014d's claws and torso. Men\u014d flees. The next day, Sasuke is surprised to see Men\u014d healed from every injury Sasuke gave him. Zans\u016bru confronts Sasuke about attacking Men\u014d. Sasuke attempts to use genjutsu, but Zans\u016bru's artificial eye makes it ineffective on him. Zans\u016bru warns him he'll increase surveillance. The prime minister wants Nanara to evacuate his village for military occupation, wishing to attack other countries to acquire land to deal with the famine, as they received no help over their lack of diplomatic relations.

Jiji and Penjira check on him. Jiji suggests Sasuke get himself checked in the infirmary, having learned of a new, attractive, and single doctor. Penjira accuses him of using Sasuke to see her again after being treated the previous day, Jiji admitting to it. Ganno refuses to join them, and reveals that Zans\u016bru's office has a cellar, where he is rumoured to keep a secret. Zans\u016bru and Men\u014d check on the Men\u014d Sasuke defeated, finding Sasuke to be troublesome, but confident that making more Men\u014d can settle things. Sasuke sneaks out at night again, and combats Men\u014d again. He wonders if this Men\u014d was healed or if it's a different one, and begins to feel the effects of poison from a claw cut on his cheek. A doctor arrives just in time to pacify Men\u014d, causing it give up attacking Sasuke and leave. Sasuke passes out, and when he wakes up in the infirmary, he learns that Sakura is the new doctor. She has come to update him on his mission, having received intel from Kakashi about the Sage of Six Paths' illness, detailing how he was cured from it with what became known as polar particles. He hid the rest of it, leaving behind clues on where and how to find it. She draws some of his blood, surprised the poison affected him. Sasuke wants her to return, respecting her strength, but finding himself capable enough, and suspicious of whatever Zans\u016bru it up to with the beasts who were supposed to be extinct. She refuses to leave, but is happy that he's concerned for her. Sasuke finds Jiji eavesdropping on them, who claims he got permission to get himself treated for his blisters. He heard that Sasuke and Sakura are married. Sakura claims she came to work there to see Sasuke, as visitors aren't allowed. On their way back to their cell, Sasuke asks Jiji not to tell anyone he's married to Sakura, and Jiji reveals he has a fianc\u00e9e himself in the Redaku capital. Jiji is appalled to learn Sasuke and Sakura are apart for years at times, and advises him to get Sakura a ring. Sasuke asks if Jiji knows anything about astronomical documents, and he advises Sasuke to ask Penjira, who is a librarian. Sakura asks Penjira about it when he's gambling during lunch break. He checks that the books are in a restricted basement, which would require Zans\u016bru's permission to check out. Sakura wants to gamble with him for the key, promising to smuggle him as many cigarettes as he wants if he wins. He introduces her to Hoshinarabe, and she picks it up quickly, beating him. He accuses her of cheating, but lends her to key anyway. At night, she explains to Sasuke she memorised the unique wear and damage of each card, something she began doing to always draw when playing with Tsunade, boring her into stop playing. She asks him about Jiji, who often visits her and talks about his fianc\u00e9e. Recalling Jiji's words, he asks her about how she feels about them spending so much time apart. She is flustered, but answers she isn't worried, even if she misses him sometimes. He makes her a wedding ring and asks her to wear it. They find the book, which contains ink paintings related to the Hoshinarabe cards. They paintings depict constellations. Sasuke recognises some of the constellations as Tailed Beasts, and they deduce the two remaining paintings depict Janm\u0101ru-Tataru and the Sage of Six Paths himself. They wonder where they could look for more information, and Sasuke mentions the rumour about Zans\u016bru's basement. Someone eavesdropping on them leaves.

Using an almond tree branch from Ganno, Jiji lures Men\u014d near to pet it. Jiji explains that despite not eating almonds, he always sees Men\u014d under the almond tree, deducing it likes the scent. Ganno pets Men\u014d, and encouraged by his success, Penjira tries it as well. However, his foot goes slightly outside their cell, agitating Men\u014d over a rule being broken. The commotion causes hot oil from the lantern to spill and burn Men\u014d, who runs away. Jiji smooths things over when a guard checks on them. The next day, Sakura greets messenger Fundaru. She learns that Fundaru himself doesn't know the specifics of what the Prime Minister wants with Zans\u016bru, only that he must inquire about a certain progress. After getting details of whether Fundaru and Zans\u016bru met before, and when Zans\u016bru last visited the palace, she gets him to Sasuke, who knocks Fundaru out with his Sharingan. They go over their plan, and Sakura explains a vulnerability she learned about Zans\u016bru's artificial eye, that it has a narrow field of vision at high angles. Sakura transforms into Fundaru and goes to meet Zans\u016bru. She distracts him by making him go to the window, and tosses Fundaru's cane across the room, actually a transformed Sasuke. Zans\u016bru asks about the missing cane, and Sakura produces another one, hidden beneath Fundaru's cloak. Sakura stalls for Sasuke to have enough time to map the keyhole with chakra and make a key with Earth Release. Zans\u016bru asks what the Prime Minister wants, and Sakura asks about the progress. Zans\u016bru answers that he already intends to send the assets to the capital, but refuses to elaborate on the numbers. Sasuke manages to get down to the cellar. He goes through another door, and is surprised to find a number of chickens and fossils. Sakura leaves the meeting with Zans\u016bru, and Sasuke discovers the room has an exit to behind the main building. From an altar present in the room, Sasuke believes Zans\u016bru is resurrecting the fossils with Impure World Reincarnation. Men\u014d attacks Sasuke, who notices the burn from the previous night hasn't healed. While dodging its attacks, Sasuke notes it doesn't have a tag embedded into it, despite clearing acting on Zans\u016bru's orders, and adjust his premise, still believing it to be reincarnation ninjutsu. He stops Men\u014d from attacking with a sheathed sword, and through a shadow clone, applies supercooled water to his burn. Sasuke lets Men\u014d bite him, and convinces it to let him help Men\u014d go back to where it was before being brought back. Reaching inside and grabbing Men\u014d's tongue, Sasuke flows his chakra to overwrite genjutsu control over it. Now affectionate, it obeys Sasuke.

She recalls Zans\u016bru's words of sending assets to the capital, wonders where he could be keeping them, and goes to search for Sasuke. She doesn't find him in the lunch hall, and reviews what they don't know yet. Ganno sits to eat next to her, and notices her wedding ring. He asks about her husband, and surprises her when he mentions Sasuke by name, explaining he overheard Sasuke and Jiji talking about it. He adds that before Sakura arrived, Sasuke would spend time watching the flowers outside, and leaves. She checks outside, and sees a blooming almond tree, whose flowers resemble cherry blossoms. Thinking about the paintings, constellations, and zodiacs, she realises those are connected to hand seals. Sasuke and Jiji work sorting out inedible apricots, Jiji telling him a prisoner died of unknown causes after eating one. Sasuke spots a lake on the distance, and Jiji explains it's supposedly a meteor crater that filled with rainwater. There are no fish, and during the day, its shade of blue makes it look like the sky fell to the earth. Sasuke realises something and leaves, telling Jiji he'll take his next kitchen duty. Sasuke and Sakura meet at her office. She explains how the hands in Hoshinarabe are the hand seals required to reveal the polar particles, and he explains he discovered where the sky that fell to earth is, asking her to accompany him at night. Sasuke leaves his cell at night, which Jiji notices. Sakura is concerned about Men\u014d, but he assures it's fine. He holds her when she trips jumping down her office window. He takes her to the lake, reflecting the starry night sky. They hold hands, and he asks her if she wants a proper wedding ring, as a reminder of their marriage when they're apart. Sakura says she thought about it, but she'd have to take it off for work. He doesn't usually worry, but it gets to him when he sees Sarada has grown taller, or Sakura has changed her hair style. Sakura feels the same when she notices faint wrinkles on him when he laughs. She performs the hand seals, and a pillar of light emerges from the lake. Sakura walks up to it and collects the sealed polar particles, causing the pillar to dissipate. She stores them, and an explosion goes off at the institute. They notice several flying dragon beasts take off, and wonder if those are the assets Zans\u016bru mentioned. Sasuke wants to capture one, and instructs Sakura to capture Zans\u016bru at the institute. She leaves for the institute, and Zans\u016bru lands on a dragon beast. He thanks Sasuke for recovering the polar particles. Sasuke realises he had used the inmate to excavate the fossils, the chickens as vessels, and the apricots which had absorbed the particles' energy to resurrect the dragon beasts. Their uncovering of the particles allowed him to revive a large number of beasts at once. Zans\u016bru claims to be acting on behalf of the nation, and Sasuke warns that using kinjutsu as such will carry consequences. Zans\u016bru doesn't know about Impure World Reincarnation when Sasuke mentions it. When Sasuke asks if he intends to support the Prime Minister, Zans\u016bru realises he has an ally near Prince Nanara. Noticing his true loyalty to the minister, Sasuke finds it unlikely that Zans\u016bru would release the jutsu. He is surprised to see with his Sharingan that Zans\u016bru has too little chakra to be a shinobi, so someone else brought back and is controlling the beasts. At the institute, several beasts continue to appear and attack the inmates. Penjira is almost killed by one, and is saved by Sakura, who punches open a whole through the institutes walls, allowing the inmates to flee, as well as punching one of the beasts nearby. She goes looking for Zans\u016bru, but he's not there. Instead, she finds inmates hiding inside, and tells them of the exit she created. Jiji asks her what happened, and she tells him Zans\u016bru is responsible. He claims he saw Zans\u016bru in the courtyard earlier, but she came from there and didn't see him. He hugs her close and stabs her with a poisoned kunai, which she recognises as the one Sasuke was poisoned with by Men\u014d. Jiji is working with Zans\u016bru, and allowed her to move freely so they could find the polar particles. He gets the particles from her. She tries to stop him, and he confesses he really did appreciate her, who reminds him of his girlfriend Margo, so she's sad she has to die, and leaves. He wants to use the particles to resurrect Margo, and uses the reincarnation ninjutsu. The entire institute begins to crumble as the ground shifts, and an excited Zans\u016bru leaves Sasuke fighting the flying beasts. A gigantic beasts emerges from where the institute used to be.

Zans\u016bru thinks the Prime Minister will be pleased by the assets. Sasuke has Men\u014d evacuate the prisoners while he goes after Sakura. He grows agitated when he can't sense her chakra. Sakura wakes up pinned, can't mould chakra because of the poison, and passes out. She wakes up to Sasuke tending her wound. She apologises for not stopping Jiji, but he tells her not to worry. She prepared a serum against the poison beforehand. Zans\u016bru joins up with Jiji, who hands him the polar particles. Zans\u016bru wants to kill all the inmates before joining the minister to suppress Nanara's rebellion. Jiji tells him not to renege on his promise. Zans\u016bru has Jiji target Ganno, but Men\u014d stops the dinosaur attacking him. They're surprised by it, and deduce Sasuke took control of Men\u014d.

Sasuke makes the flying dinosaurs crash against each other with Chidori Senbon. Men\u014d climbs the Titan to attack Zans\u016bru, who narrowly escapes, being picked up by a flying dinosaur. Sasuke continues attacking the dinosaurs with his sword, Fire Release, and Chidori. Sasuke receives a message by a hawk, and shares that the minister has been imprisoned by king Nanara. Zans\u016bru decides to keep fighting in the minister's name, as he can still grow his dinosaur army while in possession of the polar particles. Sakura helps more prisoners evacuate, but is chased by Jiji. He blocks her escape with an Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall. Sakura becomes paralysed as a side effect of the serum, but Jiji gets likewise caught in a trap she lured him into. Sasuke lures the Titan into the lake, where it struggles to move. Sasuke switches places with a flying dinosaur, getting close to Zans\u016bru, who commands the one carrying him to flee. It drops him instead, crashing down into the ground, dead. Sasuke switches with another dinosaur on the ground. Zans\u016bru commanding the dinosaurs despite not being in control of them meant new orders replaced the old ones. Sasuke retrieves the polar particles, and he and Men\u014d get back to Sasuke. He asks what Jiji's goal was. Sakura releases her trap, and Sasuke intends to hand Jiji over to the Land of Redaku. Jiji reveals he was a missing-nin from Suna, and joined the minister when asked to create a private army. He fell in love with his attendant Margo, turning away from war. However, while he was in a mission, Margo died in an epidemic, and he was approached with an offer. If he revived the dinosaurs, the country would release her corpse from him to resurrect. Sakura admits she might try the same in his situation, but her friends would stop her, and she doesn't believe their deceased loved ones would approve. Sasuke reveals Jiji was deceived, as Margo is mentioned as cooperating with king Nanara. Jiji cries in joy and relief, and releases the reincarnation ninjutsu, all the dinosaurs turning into dust. Sasuke bids Men\u014d farewell. One of the dinosaurs attacks Sakura as it disappears, but Jiji protects her, getting bitten. Sakura tries healing him, feeling he has to go see Margo, but he doesn't think he deserves it. Later, Naruto has recovered in Konoha, and asks about how Redaku is doing to Kakashi. He updates him that Nanara is officially king now. Sakura catches up with Ino, who notes her ring. Sakura recalls how Sasuke found her in the debris because of the ring. Nanara visits the ruins of the institute, and intends to rebuild it with Margo and Jiji's help.

She obeys Ada as she commands her to release Code, shocking Shikamaru. He asks Delta what's happening, but she has no idea. Shikamaru asks Ino for backup. Sasuke apologises to Boruto for failing to keep his promise when Momoshiki took him over, which forced Kawaki to take on that role. Sasuke explains only a few people know Kawaki killed him, which he considers fortunate as many already disapprove of Kawaki. Boruto thinks they shouldn't hate Kawaki as he asked for it, but Sasuke counters that whoever kills him will be hated. Boruto says he could only have asked Kawaki, and Kawaki was only able to do it because they're brothers. Boruto thanks Sasuke for his forehead protector, which helped firm his resolve and attempts to return it. Since it helped, Sasuke gifts it to him, even if Boruto thinks it's precious memento between Sasuke and Naruto. Boruto puts it on, elated. Sasuke is concerned he'll be the next to have to show resolve. Sarada and Mitsuki watch from afar, wondering what they're talking about. They think Boruto could have died, and Mitsuki gets chills thinking of being absent when Boruto needed help, and wonders what he'd do if someone tried to kill him. Sarada feels a mix of shock, relief, and anger over what happened. She doesn't blame Boruto, but wonders if they're so undependable. Mitsuki asks if Sarada likes Boruto, catching her off guard, and she says her wanting to do more for him is independent on the presence or absence of feelings. She points out Mitsuki's eyes light up when it comes to Boruto, and complains that Sasuke is her father first before being Boruto's teacher. Mitsuki says they need to get stronger to face the \u014ctsutsuki, and she adds she also needs it to be Hokage. Kawaki wakes up in a room with Sumire and Naruto, who comments it reminds him of the first time they met. He asks Naruto if he came to talk about old memories, and Naruto asks Sumire to have her leave the room. Before she leaves, he asks Naruto if he condemns him for killing Boruto, shocking her. Naruto reveals Boruto is alive thanks to the K\u0101ma. Naruto is thankful he was there, otherwise they might all be dead, and adds that Boruto feels the same. As Naruto assures Kawaki he belongs in Konoha, Ino contacts him and Sasuke, reporting Code and Ada's invasion. Sasuke tells Boruto of the attack, and the two move out. Naruto claims to have forgotten an urgent matter, and confirms to Sumire that Boruto is fine. Kawaki focuses on his K\u0101ma, manifesting Isshiki's d\u014djutsu.

Shikamaru notices they're all experiencing consequences of Ada's ability, and asks Ino to connect with him Amado, which she does. He informs Amado of their communication, and warns him not to give it away, before asking about Ada and her ability. Amado informs him they're all Ada's captives, having been enchanted by her, that Ada herself has no control over it, and the effect lasts until she dies. Delta is infatuated with her. Shikamaru wants to kill her, but Amado says it's futile. She tells him to relax, and he struggles to maintain his jutsu, his will impressing her. Amado warns him that resistance might damage his mind. He drops his kunai and releases his jutsu. Shikamaru thinks of the danger if Naruto and Sasuke were to come into the room. Code begins torturing Amado. Shikamaru asks Ada her motive, if she has a grudge against Konoha. She answers Code's reasons are personal to him, and admits she's helping him because she likes Kawaki. In exchange for helping restore his power, he'll help her with Kawaki. Shikamaru asks Ino to change to access codes to the room, and stall the backups he requested.

Amado corrects him, pointing out that while Isshiki's soul has vanished and can no longer possess him, the \u014ctsutsuki changes to his body remain. Kawaki gets hostile with Amado, until he points out that Kawaki needs more power to protect Naruto from Code. Amado thinks Naruto would die against Code now that he has lost Kurama, and suggests Kawaki get a new K\u0101ma that acts only as a weapon now that Isshiki's soul is gone. Kawaki hates the K\u0101ma, but Amado finds him rational enough to grasp for any available power to achieve his goals.

Sumire suspects Amado has an ulterior motive for wishing to restore Kawaki's K\u0101ma, something else he wants Kawaki to do. Amado admits it's a personal matter he's unwilling to share with her, as it doesn't concern her. He assures her he has no intention of harming Konoha. Sumire sees a container next do him.

She feels she can't help Boruto yet, and asks Kawaki to do it if he goes overboard. Kawaki says he will.

Amado says most recent events have been unexpected, such as him defecting to Konoha, and most of all Kawaki's attachment to Naruto.

Boruto believes Kawaki is using a shadow clone as a decoy, but Naruto points out those would still be sensed. Naruto asks to see Kawaki, who opens the door and releases the shadow clone. The real Kawaki goes outside the village, Ada informing Code about it. Code travels to a nearby Claw Mark, and speaks to Ada through another, asking her to guide him to Kawaki. Code reaches Kawaki, marking him and using the Claw Mark to close the distance. Ino connects Naruto and Shikamaru, who discuss why Kawaki would leave when he was acclimating well to the village. Naruto tells Ino Kawaki erased his chakra signature, and Boruto tells him he can no longer sense Kawaki, finding he's too far away. Naruto wants Boruto to leave it to them, but Boruto leaves while they're distracted. Amado asks how they could have lost Kawaki, and Shikamaru says he ran away on his own, speculating on his motive. Boruto goes in the direction he last sensed Kawaki, hoping that the sensors will track him while he tracks Kawaki. Kawaki and Code fight, Ada warning Code not to accidentally kill him. Code diverts a blast from Kawaki with a Claw Mark. Code asks why he left the village, and Kawaki wants Code to kill just him as revenge for Isshiki, leaving Konoha out of it. Code refuses it and beats Kawaki around, despite Ada's protests. Code reveals he has inherited Isshiki's will to cultivate a God Tree and eat its chakra fruit. He surprises Kawaki by saying he's off his revenge list because someone else wants to meet him, and prepares to take Kawaki with him. Boruto arrives just in time to interfere. Ada informs Code that Boruto could still sense Kawaki and went after him. Boruto and Kawaki scold each other for getting themselves in danger. Boruto says they'll sense him and send reinforcements, but Kawaki thinks that defeats the point of what he did, willing to die himself to protect Naruto. He wants Code to take him to whoever wants to meet him, since talking to Code is getting him nowhere. Ada is flustered about Kawaki wanting to meet her. Boruto and Kawaki argue over what's happening, and Boruto punches him when he says what Naruto wants and thinks doesn't matter to what Kawaki does to keep him safe. Ada also gets flustered by Boruto's commitment to Kawaki, calling him a brother. Boruto activates his K\u0101ma.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "291", "Episode Title": "Control", "Japanese Airdate": "12 March 2023", "episode synopsis text": "Code is pleased by Boruto's drawing on his K\u0101ma's power. Recalling Momoshiki's taunting, Kawaki insults him. Code is curious by how Momoshiki's consciousness can emerge while Boruto remains only a vessel. They are surprised to notice Boruto is still in control as he cautions Kawaki to stay back. Boruto attacks with shadow clones, and Code notices his increased strength. He places a mark on Boruto and uses it to avoid attacks and launch his own at the clones. Boruto manages to pull Code through his mark with the help of a clone and lands a punch. Code puts distance between them, and Kawaki wonders how Boruto is in control and stronger than before. Code consults Ada, who while unsure of what's happening in Boruto's body, speculates it might be due to Amado's drugs, and warns him not to underestimate Boruto. Naruto instructs Ino to look for Boruto's chakra instead of Kawaki's. Shikamaru arrives, concerned that the enemy might be where they are as well, and clarifies he'll be going with Naruto, as he no longer has Kurama's power. He further justifies it with Sasuke still being away tracking Code, and Sai being busy guarding Amado. Hinata wants to join them, but Naruto wants her to stay with Himawari with Shikamaru agree asking Hinata not to be insistant on going. Himawari asks Naruto to come home safe with Boruto and Kawaki. Naruto reassures her while entering Sage Mode. Boruto attempts to absorb Code's marks in vain. Kawaki explains that while they're mostly chakra based, there's enough iron from Code's blood in them to make them physical matter that K\u0101ma can't absorb. He asks Boruto about Momoshiki, who also speculates Amado's medicine might be responsible for him not emerging. Boruto wants to focus on taking Code down. Code comments that regardless of medicine, they can't get rid of Momoshiki, and that whoever he is, he's still an \u014ctsutsuki, and as a quality sacrifice, should produce a fine God Tree. Boruto notices Code's knowledge of Amado's drugs. Code decides to grab Boruto when his maturation is almost complete, and moves through his marks to grab Kawaki for Ada. Kawaki attacks Code with a shadow clone, forcing him to move through a mark to escape Boruto's Rasengan. Code comments on Kawaki's change of heart, who explains all he does is for Naruto, Boruto adding that taking him down now would be the most expedient thing to do. He and Code exchange insults. Naruto in Sage Mode finds Boruto and an unidentified chakra, and coordinates with Ino. Naruto and Shikamaru move out, Naruto leaving behind two shadow clones gathering natural energy. He assuages Shikamaru's concern about the duration of Sage Mode, and Shikamaru in turn asks him not to overdo it. Code and Boruto fight, with Code narrowly avoiding Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan. Ada tells Code to stop fooling around. Boruto suddenly collapses in pain.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "292", "Episode Title": "Hunger", "Japanese Airdate": "19 March 2023", "episode synopsis text": "Code evades Momoshiki's attack, and is amazed by his strength as an \u014ctsutsuki, understanding how Boro lost to him. Momoshiki states Code is next, and resumes attacking, pressuring him. Ada contacts Code, warning him Momoshiki is too strong. Code immobilises Kawaki, using him as shield against Momoshiki, who needs an \u014ctsutsuki to sacrifice for a chakra fruit. Momoshiki changes his Rasengan into a ranged, precision attack, separating Code from Kawaki, who he grabs. Kawaki attempts to fight Momoshiki, but is overwhelmed. Shikamaru arrives, pinning Momoshiki with his shadow, allowing Naruto to save Kawaki. Ada wonders how Code will retrieve Kawaki now. Kawaki is distressed about Naruto putting himself in danger. Shikamaru attempts to constrict Momoshiki with his shadow, but he's too strong. Code holds Shikamaru hostage, and tells Momoshiki this is an opportunity for him to take revenge on Naruto. Momoshiki revels in the opportunity for making the son kill his father. Kawaki fails to stop Momoshiki, who aims an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan at them. Thinking on his wish for power to protect Naruto, Kawaki absorbs it, manifesting a new K\u0101ma, to everyone's surprise. Ada tells Code Amado never intended to let Kawaki make a choice in the matter, probably restoring it along with his arm. Shikamaru wonders who Code is talking to. Momoshiki wonders what Amado is scheming, and admonishes Kawaki for always being used by someone else. Kawaki manifests Isshiki's D\u014djutsu and uses his abilities against Momoshiki, startling everyone. Kawaki confirms to Naruto he's himself, and asks him not to interfere while he does what he does for Naruto. Kawaki and Momoshiki fight more evenly, Kawaki making hand seals for a Fire Release with Momoshiki's hand. They fight atop a Disruption Cube.

He attempts to crush Momoshiki with a cube, but Naruto saves Boruto. Naruto tells Kawaki it's enough, but he's determined to kill Momoshiki. Naruto can't kill Boruto, so Kawaki will. Boruto stands up, disappointed the meds didn't work after all. Kawaki asks if Boruto remembers his promise, which Boruto confirms. He pushes Naruto away with Wind Release: Gale Palm, and asks Kawaki to do it. Kawaki transforms his arm, ramming it through Boruto's upper body, to everyone's shock.\n"}, {"Episode Number": "293", "Episode Title": "Farewell", "Japanese Airdate": "26 March 2023", "episode synopsis text": "Naruto thinks back to Boruto's life as he tries to wake him up in vain. Code is surprised by Boruto's death at Kawaki's hand, and the return of his K\u0101ma. Ada warns him against considering sacrificing Kawaki in Boruto's place for the God Tree. Code threatens to kill Shikamaru if Kawaki approaches. Kawaki is indifferent, so Code releases Shikamaru and tries to escape. Kawaki stops him by shrinking his Claw Marks so Code can't use them. Kawaki mocks Code, pointing out that killing Boruto should make it clear the lengths he'll go through to protect Naruto. He goes on the offensive and pressures Code. Shikamaru goes to check on Naruto, still in disbelief and denial of what happened, and stresses that the battle still isn't over. Kawaki tells Code that if the person who wants to meet him is also against Naruto, he won't show them any mercy either, and blasts him point blank. Kawaki is knocked out, Code having pulled Daemon through the Claw Mark on his head to reflect the attack. Ada is angry that Code involved Daemon without her permission, and he apologises for waking him up. Daemon wants to fight, but Code sends him back to Ada. She warns him he's been doing whatever he wants a lot, and stresses that Kawaki better be ok. Code tells her she can see Kawaki herself, and she assures him that had Kawaki died, she'd send Daemon to kill him. Code begrudgingly admits he's not strong enough to overcome Kawaki at the moment. Shikamaru tries pinning him when he moves to collect Kawaki, and says reinforcements are on the way. Code thinks it's a bluff, but is unwilling to risk it when Shikamaru points out that fighting Kawaki exhausted him. Code leaves, wanting Shikamaru to inform Amado he'll use him to have his limiters removed. Shikamaru asks Naruto what precautions should be taken with Kawaki, considering the extremes he'll go to protect Naruto. Naruto refuses to blame Kawaki. Shikamaru struggles to believe Naruto doesn't blame Kawaki for Boruto's death. Boruto moves and asks who's dead, to their shock. Naruto cries in joy and hugs him. Boruto has new markings on his torso, and Momoshiki communicates with him. Momoshiki explains that as his vessel, Boruto is the anchor of his soul, and his death would extinguish him like Isshiki. He reveals he had to use the still unextracted portion of his K\u0101ma to reconstruct the destroyed portions of Boruto's body. Because of that, Momoshiki can no longer resurrect through K\u0101ma. Boruto believes this means he wins, but Momoshiki points out that the full extraction of K\u0101ma means he's fully \u014ctsutsuki now, so he can be sacrificed to grow a God Tree, something Code will realise soon. Momoshiki adds that Boruto won't be revived like that again, and Boruto points out he was wrong before, recalling his previous warnings. Momoshiki laughs, saying the two matters are unrelated, eagerly waiting for it to play out. Boruto explains the nature of his resurrection to Naruto and Shikamaru. Ada notifies Code of these developments. She reminds Code of the terms of their deal, and warns that if he remains useless after his limiters are removed, or if she determines him to be a nuisance, she'll have no qualms disposing of him. He assures her that he has already taken measures. Kawaki wakes up in the hospital, Sumire taking care of him. He wonders why he's not imprisoned for killing Boruto, and Sumire reveals he's fine. Kawaki comments on Amado having restored his K\u0101ma, and admits that for the first time he was glad to have it, needing it as otherwise Naruto would be dead. Boruto and Kawaki later talk at the Hokage Rock, discussing what \"everything\" means to each of them. Kawaki is determined to eliminate threats to Naruto, and Boruto is determined to prove Momoshiki wrong. A flashforward shows the start of their fight on the Hokage Rock.\n"}]}
