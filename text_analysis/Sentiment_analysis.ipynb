Many shinobi fought the beast but killed all those standing before it. The Fourth Hokage saved the town by sealing the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.\\n\\nIn the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto cannot perform basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.\\n\\nAfter successfully stealing the scroll, instructor Iruka Umino finds Naruto, who realised that Mizuki had tricked Naruto. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining since the day he was born, Nine-Tails that had been sealed inside him that the reason the villagers hate him so much. He explains that Iruka must hate him the most because the Nine-tails was the one who killed his parents. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions and that he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.\\n\\nAmazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his forehead protector. He says that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.   \\n\"},\n",

Suddenly, the Third\\'s grandson comes charging into the room, wishing to challenge him for the title as Hokage, but slips and falls. Konohamaru tries to claim Naruto made him trip, angering Naruto. Konohamaru chastises Naruto, believing that since he\\'s the grandson of the Third Hokage, Naruto wouldn\\'t harm him. However, Naruto replies that he doesn\\'t care and punches the boy.\\n\\nAfter Naruto leaves, Ebisu, Konohamaru\\'s trainer, informs the boy not to let Naruto bother him, as he is beneath him. He carries on to say that if he wished to quickly be the next Hokage, he needs to stick by him. However, during his speech, Konohamaru left to follow Naruto without him noticing.

While seeming uninterested at first, after Konohamaru refers to Naruto as \"boss\", he accepts. After training, Konohamaru explains to Naruto that the reason he wants to be the next Hokage was so that people can see him as more than just the grandson of the Third Hokage.\\n\\nElsewhere, on the rooftop of the Hokage\\'s office, the Third is seen looking up at the Fourth Hokage\\'s monument. After Iruka appears and explains how Naruto believes that becoming a genin will change things, the Third explains that people don\\'t change easily.

As Ebisu prepares himself, he is surprised when Naruto and his clones use the Sexy Technique, causing the latter to have a huge nose bleed and fall unconscious.

Sakura spots Sasuke sitting down and runs over to him, knocking down Naruto in the process, and asks if she could sit next to him. However, Ino comes over and states that she should be the one to sit next to Sasuke before many of the other girls do the same thing. Upset over the attention Sasuke is getting from the girls, Naruto gets on top of the desk and glares at Sasuke, with the latter returning the favour. Suddenly, Tobio accidentally bumps into Naruto, causing him to fall forward and kiss Sasuke, much to the girls' dismay. As a result, Naruto gets pummelled by them, because they were angry that they weren't Sasuke's first kiss.\\n\\nAfter Iruka arrives, he explains the next step that the genin will take, explaining that they will be in a team of three led by a jōnin. He then announces that Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke will be Team 7; Hinata, Kiba and Shino will be Team 8; and Ino, Shikamaru and Chōji will be Team 10. Naruto abruptly asks Iruka why he had to be on a team with Sasuke before being told that he had the worst scores of all the graduates, while Sasuke had the best, so in turn, they were put together to create a balanced group.\\n\\nDuring lunchtime, Sakura tries to find to Sasuke to ask him to have lunch with her to no avail. She then runs into Naruto who asks her to have lunch with him, but she coldly dismisses him. Angered yet again, Naruto ambushes Sasuke through an open window. The ending results shows Sasuke standing over a gagged and bound Naruto, but is later revealed that Sasuke only defeated a substitution before the real Naruto overpowers him with the Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto then transforms into Sasuke and heads out to find Sakura. When he finds her, he asks her what she thought of Naruto. She replies by saying that he was annoying. Sakura then leans in to kiss Sasuke, but as they are about to kiss, Sasuke is forced to go to the bathroom. \\n\\nWhen the real Sasuke manages to escape, he runs into Sakura and asks if she's seen Naruto. Brushing off what he asked, she proceeds to mock him, believing that he's so annoying because he had no parents to teach him how to behave and that he was all alone. This sparks Sasuke to remark that Sakura had no idea what it felt like to be alone before saying that she was annoying. This causes Sakura to have some resolve for Naruto, deciding to be nicer to him.\\n\\nAfter Naruto finishes using the bathroom, he runs into Sasuke, much to his surprise. Naruto uses the Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to attack Sasuke, but is unable to proceed due to having to use the bathroom again. After finishing, he spots Sakura who is strangely being nice to him. This leads him to believe that it was Sasuke transformed as her, and is prepared to face off against her until he has to use the bathroom yet again.\\n\\nAt Naruto's house, the Third Hokage briefs Kakashi on the team he will be leading, Team 7. Kakashi examines a carton of milk and states that it was spoiled, which is the reason Naruto had to run to the bathroom so much.

As punishment for running late, Naruto decides to pull a prank on him by putting a chalkboard eraser in between the opening of the door to have it fall on him when he opens the door. Sasuke points out that an elite ninja will never fall for something like that, but to his surprise, he does, amusing Naruto and secretly Sakura as well. This action causes Kakashi to ridicule them by calling them \"idiots\", much to their dismay.\\n\\nKakashi has the team introduce themselves: Naruto says that he wants to be Hokage one day, Sakura merely blushes and glances at Sasuke, and Sasuke declares that his goal is to kill a certain someone. Kakashi then tells them that they will undergo a survival test tomorrow morning, which will determine which of 27 graduates will be sent to the Academy, with the chances of failing being 66%. Before dismissing them, he also tells them to skip breakfast or else they\\'d puke.\\n\\nAt 5am the next day, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura arrive at the designated area as instructed. However, once again, Kakashi arrives late, upsetting them. Kakashi claims that a black cat passed his way so he had to go the long way. Kakashi then tells them that they will have to retrieve a bell from him by noon, and since there are only two, one of them will be not only fail but will be tied to a tree post and watch as everyone else eats. Sakura deduces that Kakashi made them skip breakfast to make the test more difficult. Once the test begins, the three of them go off and hide. \\n\\nElsewhere, Iruka discusses with the Third Hokage about his concerns of Kakashi and the training his former students will endure after hearing rumours. The Third understands and gives Iruka a book detailing the trainees who have passed and failed under Kakashi\\'s wing. To Iruka\\'s surprise, none of them have passed.\\n\\nBack at the training ground, just as Kakashi comments that his team has hidden well, Naruto makes his presence known and charges at him. Kakashi nonchalantly takes out his Icha Icha book and evades all of Naruto\\'s attacks, before appearing behind him and using the One Thousand Years of Death to send him flying into the water. Naruto returns uses the Shadow Clone Technique to cleverly distract Kakashi as he had one sneak up behind him. To Naruto\\'s surprise, as he prepares to a punch on the restrained Kakashi, Kakashi confuses Naruto having him think he turned himself into Naruto\\'s clone. This caused the clones to attack one another, but in actuality, Kakashi used the Body Flicker Technique to switch one of Naruto\\'s clones with himself. After Naruto disperses his clones, he spots a bell on the ground and joyfully picks it up, but it turned out to be a trap as Naruto is hung upside down by a rope attached to a tree. Kakashi appears and lectures him. Sasuke takes this opportunity to attack Kakashi from the trees with shuriken and kunai that strike the jōnin.\\n'},\n",

A worried Sakura runs off to find Sasuke, only to be caught by Kakashi\\'s genjutsu that made her believe she found a very injured Sasuke. This caused her to scream and faint. Once confronted by Kakashi, Sasuke forces Kakashi to stop reading Icha Icha and use both hands to defend against his string of taijutsu attacks. Sasuke then launches a giant fireball at Kakashi. The jōnin manages to avoid it by burring underground, before dragging Sasuke down, leaving only his head to be seen.\\n\\nNaruto manages to free himself from the tree he was hanging from and spots the food for lunch.

Sasuke manages to free himself and is there to see Sakura awaken, who is relieved to see he is unharmed. Despite time running out, Sasuke is still set on getting a bell, informing Sakura that he came close to doing so. Knowing that she couldn\\'t get a bell and didn\\'t want to be separated from Sasuke, Sakura tries to convince him to give up and try next year. Sasuke dismisses the idea, explaining that he is an avenger and doesn\\'t need any setbacks.

The three share in the happy news until Kakashi goes on to say that they will be dropped from being a ninja permanently. Naruto is outraged at this and asks him why. Kakashi explains that they don\\'t think like ninja, thinking more like \"little kids\". Sasuke charges at Kakashi, but is easily restrained. Kakashi further explains that team-work was the key in retrieving a bell. Kakashi notes that each of them were so self-entitled throughout the challenge: Naruto recklessly tried to face a foe who clearly outmatched him alone without even a real plan, Sakura focused all her interest on Sasuke while making no effort to help Naruto when she was to do so, and Sasuke arrogantly believed his team-mates weren\\'t worth his time and acted as such. After showing them Konoha\\'s Memorial Stone, Kakashi decides to give them another chance. Kakashi tells Sasuke and Sakura to eat and replenish their energy. However, since Naruto broke the rules and tried to eat before the test was complete, he is forced to watch. Furthermore, if either of them feed Naruto, they will immediately fail. \\n\\nAfter Kakashi leaves, Sasuke and Sakura begin eating their food, while Naruto\\'s stomach growls of hunger. Sasuke decides to share his food with Naruto, stating that they\\'d need to retrieve the bells as a team and need everyone at good strength. Sakura hesitates, but decides to share her food as well. Kakashi suddenly appears and tells them that they will be punished for not following orders. However, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura band together to state that they are a team, and to their surprise, are rewarded with Kakashi stating they have passed. He explains that those who break the rules are considered scum, but those who abandon their friends are even worse than scum. He states that they are the only team to abide by his orders.\\n'},\n",

With their mission successfully completed, the Third Hokage informs them of the available D-rank missions, such as babysitting the chief counsellor\\'s three-year-old. Naruto expresses that he wants to go on a real mission that\\'s exciting and challenging. Iruka lectures him, stating that like every beginner genin with no experience, he must start with simpler missions to develop his skills. The Third goes on to explain that with a higher-ranked mission comes higher difficulty and greater risk to the shinobi. However, Naruto exclaims that he is a ninja now and wants to be treated as such. Amused at his statement, the Third decides to give the team a C-rank mission to escort Tazuna, a master bridge builder, to the Land of Waves. When Tazuna meets the team, he expresses disbelief in the fact that kids are going to be guarding him but works with them nonetheless. \\n\\nAs they make their way to the Land of Waves, two chūnin-level Kiri-nin emerge from a puddle and binds Kakashi with shuriken-laced chains, before pulling and ripping him apart. With Kakashi \"defeated\", the duo turns their attention to Naruto, who freezes up. Before they can land an attack, Sasuke intervenes and saves Naruto. The duo split up, leaving one behind as the other charges at Tazuna. Sakura steps in front of Tazuna to defend him before Sasuke appears in front of her to aid. Before anything further can happen, Kakashi appears and effortlessly defeats the duo, though Naruto does attain a small scratch from one of their Metal Gauntlets, which contained poison. It is revealed that Kakashi used the Body Replacement Technique to escape the duo\\'s initial attack, suspecting an ambush when he discovered their puddle on a clear day. Kakashi compliments Sasuke and Sakura for their courage but expresses disappointment in Naruto with how poorly he handled the situation. Tazuna questions why Kakashi took so long to help, with the latter explaining that he could have defeated them quickly but needed to know who their target was. Kakashi points out that their target was Tazuna and that had he told them that he would be hunted by ninja, the mission would be a B-rank or higher, and a different team would have been assigned. Sakura suggests they quit the mission, not only due to the higher difficulty but because of Naruto\\'s wound. Unwilling to jeopardise the mission, Naruto decides to take out a kunai and uses it to remove the poison from his hand. He then makes an oath that he will never run away or back down from any mission, threat, or enemy, as well as not lose to Sasuke. After this, Kakashi bandages Naruto\\'s wound so he doesn\\'t bleed out, but discovers that it had already begun to heal due to the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.  \\n\\nElsewhere, Gatō, the man who hired the Demon Brothers to eliminate Tazuna, complains about their failure to Zabuza, the duo\\'s apparent boss. Zabuza raises his Kubikiribōchō at Gatō to shut him up, and states that he will handle it himself. Gatō informs him that they will be expecting another assault and that a high-level ninja is accompanying Tazuna.

Kakashi discourages this, telling her that even if they have the instinct to win, they don't have the instinct to kill, which is the most important. He notes that he has no option but to stay put, or else Tazuna would be slain. Kakashi goes to reveal his Sharingan to Zabuza once again, but he claims that using the same trick too many times will result in the enemy finding a way to counter it. Kakashi responds that he should consider himself lucky, as he’s the only man to see his Sharingan twice. Zabuza brags about training Haku to become a unique killing machine, whose jutsu even surpasses his own.\\n\\nInside the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals, Naruto and Sasuke struggle against Haku's superior speed. After watching Haku counter shadow clones repeatedly, Sasuke begins to see his movements. He uses Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique as Haku is preoccupied with Naruto's clones, burning the side of his skirt and shocking the ninja, who's slowing down. Meanwhile, Zabuza informs Kakashi their last battle was a fluke, including him losing. Haku was watching the entire time from a tree, devising a lethal plan. Using his Hiding in Mist Technique to negate the Sharingan, Zabuza says the next time Kakashi sees him will be his last time seeing anything. Vanishing, Kakashi is left anticipating his opponent's next move. He finally realises that Zabuza will strike at Tazuna and Sakura, rushing to intercept the attack.

Refusing to accept an obvious defeat but running low on chakra, Naruto ends up fainting. Sasuke holds his own against Haku, protecting Naruto's unconscious body by activating his Sharingan, allowing him to track Haku's incredibly fast movements. Amazed at Sasuke also having a Kekkei Genkai that awakened itself in battle, Haku realises he would have the disadvantage in a drawn out fight, as any attacks would just be deflected. Instead he targets a vulnerable Naruto with a volley of senbon, making Sasuke instinctively move to shield his teammate.\\n\\nElsewhere, Kakashi has taken a hit from Zabuza's blade at a last second attempt to save Sakura and Tazuna. Laughing, Zabuza goes on about almost losing the bridge builder as Kakashi was too worried about his students up ahead. Naruto wakes up to see Sasuke standing in front of him, struck and barely holding onto life. Shocked, Naruto catches him as he collapses and goes completely still. Believing his friend has died, Naruto’s enraged and subconsciously taps into the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox within him. Kakashi and Zabuza sense the change, making Kakashi wonder if the seal was broken. Haku stares in disbelief as the fox’s power heals Naruto's wounds and changes his body.\\n\"},\n",

Naruto, still angered by the \"death\" of Sasuke, had weakened the seal that kept the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox\\'s chakra in place. Surging with power, Naruto healed his wounds and attacked, brutally overwhelming Haku, and deflecting his needle attacks with waves of pure chakra. Haku attempts to flee the circle, but Naruto sees him and snatches his arm with the speed of the Nine-Tails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the battle between Zabuza and Kakashi continues. Kakashi is relieved to sense the seal confining the Nine-Tails had only weakened, and had only let a small portion of the fox\\'s chakra out. He decides to end the battle, Zabuza being curious as to how Kakashi would do that when he can’t find him amongst the mist. Kakashi’s only response to this, is pulling out a scroll.\\n\\nNaruto having grabbed Haku\\'s arm, delivers a powerful punch, sending him through one of the mirrors, simultaneously destroying them all. Naruto rushes at Haku again, ready to deliver another enormous blow. At that moment, Haku\\'s mask comes off to reveal the boy he met in the forest. This causes Naruto to pause his attack. Haku asks Naruto to kill him, as he’s no longer useful to Zabuza, calling himself nothing more than a broken tool. He goes on to explain his past; being born in a small village, and how his parents dearly loved him. However during that time, anyone with a kekkei genkai, a bloodline trait, was feared. When Haku was a small boy, he discovered the powers inherited from his mother. Unfortunately, his father witnessed this, and murdered her out of shame. Just as Haku\\'s father was about to kill him too, Haku subconsciously activated his trait, ending his father’s life. A little while after that day, Zabuza found Haku, taking him in and training him in the most advanced ninja skills.\\n\\nKakashi finally uses the scroll he pulled out earlier to use Summoning: Earth Release: Tracking Fang Technique. Though Kakashi can\\'t see or hear Zabuza, he would smell him out instead with these tracking dogs. Earlier, Kakashi let himself be sliced by Zabuza\\'s blade, covering it in blood. Now wearing the same sword, Zabuza is easier to trace. Kakashi then introduces his only original technique: Lightning Cutter.\\n'},\n",

To his disappointment, the adults are too afraid to get involved, but Inari is willing to go to the bridge alone if necessary. At the bridge, Kakashi has immobilised Zabuza with his Ninken and readies his Lightning Cutter for a finishing blow. Meanwhile, Haku, having been defeated by Naruto, has seemingly lost his purpose in life (serving Zabuza) and requests that Naruto kill him. Naruto is confused and argues that being a shinobi is more than just mindless killing, but Haku won't be dissuaded. Naruto relents, saying softly that they might have been friends under different circumstances, and charges at Haku with his kunai drawn. However, Haku senses that Zabuza's life is in danger and blocks Naruto's attack. Declaring he's not ready to die yet, he rushes to Zabuza's side just in time to take all the damage of Kakashi's Lightning Cutter. Back at the village, Tsunami tells Inari that he is too young to fight, but he is determined to defend his village. His demeanour reminds Tsunami of Kaiza, which surprises her. Inari leaves to go protect the bridge but finds a crowd waiting for him outside. As Zabuza's mist clears, Naruto is stunned to find Haku killed by Kakashi's attack. Zabuza is unfazed by his partner's sacrifice and swings his sword to slice through Kakashi and Haku at the same time. Kakashi evades this blow and prepares to resume the fight, telling an enraged Naruto to stay out of it. Tazuna accompanies Sakura to Sasuke's body. The girl tries to maintain her composure as per shinobi requirements but breaks down in tears when she sees that Sasuke is cold and lifeless.

Lee explains they simply cannot beat him, as he is the strongest of the Konohagakure genin right now.\\n\\nFinally interested, Sasuke accepts his challenge, and attacks. He’s instantly met with Lee's Leaf Whirlwind and goes flying backwards. Getting back up, Sasuke prepares, resorting to his Sharingan to figure out Lee's technique this time. Again, this is futile and Lee explains it’s because his techniques are neither ninjutsu or genjutsu, but mere taijutsu, also known as martial arts. With hand-to-hand combat, the Sharingan isn't helpful, even if he can see the techniques, one’s body cannot move fast enough to react. Lee uses the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf to kick off his next move in order to finish off Sasuke, but a large turtle stops him before he carries this out. \\n\\nThe turtle seemingly reprimands Lee for using a forbidden technique, leaving Naruto to think the turtle is Lee's sensei. Might Guy, his actual sensei, appears on top of the turtle and punches Lee across the face as punishment, proceeding to hug him, and cry afterward.

In the forest, Naruto and Gaara both lay on the ground, devoid of chakra. Naruto sympathizes with Gaara for his childhood but threatens to kill Gaara if he should ever bring harm to his friends again. Sasuke comes to Naruto\\'s side and informs him that Sakura was going to be all right. Realising that Naruto\\'s strength came from the desire to protect others, Gaara begins to reshape his view of the world as his siblings take him home, and apologises to Temari and Kankurō, much to the two\\'s surprise. The next day, the ninja of Konoha mourn the deaths of those who died during the invasion, especially the Third Hokage. Naruto wonders why people sacrifice themselves for others, and Iruka says that it leaves behind a legacy to others, and they are remembered forever. At the same moment, two shinobi are standing outside the village. One asks the other if he feels sorry for his old village. The other hesitates a little but eventually says \"no\", and moves his head up a little, revealing the eye of a Sharingan.\\n'},\n",

Naruto completes his morning training and meets up with Konohamaru, who is gazing at the mountainside image of the Third. Konohamaru impresses Naruto with his commitment to rebuilding the village, and Naruto hands him a coupon for free ramen at Ichiraku. Somewhere in Sunagakure, the rotten corpses of the Fourth Kazekage and his two guards are discovered by a shinobi team led by Baki, who curses Orochimaru for his deception, while the latter is shown recovering in his hideout alongside Kabuto while discussing the difficulty of his situation and his future goals. Jiraiya is approached by the village's elders, who offer him the position of Fifth Hokage, as he is one of the legendary Sannin. He declines, but adds that if they are looking for a Sannin to fill the position, then Tsunade would be a much better candidate for the title. He offers to find her for Konoha, though asks that he be allowed to take Naruto with him. Sasuke is called to a tea shop by Kakashi, where Asuma Sarutobi and Kurenai Yūhi are already there. Within the tea shop are the two hooded figures, which the three jōnin realise but don't convey; with a nod by Kakashi, the two jōnin head to meet up with the duo, while Sasuke is whisked away by Kakashi. Asuma and Kurenai demand to know the identities of the duo, and are surprised to see the infamous Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshikagi in their village. The four engage in battle, though Itachi and Kisame quickly gain the advantage. As Asuma and Kurenai are about to be killed, Kakashi comes to their rescue.\\n\"},\n",

Itachi, however, is more so, having access to the Mangekyō Sharingan, and quickly attacks Kakashi with his Tsukuyomi. With his genjutsu, Itachi tortures Kakashi for what he perceives as seventy-two hours in seconds. As Kakashi struggles to remain standing, he asks Itachi why he has returned to Konoha. Itachi replies that they're after Naruto. Kakashi remembers a conversation with Jiraiya, where Jiraiya tells him that he has been monitoring Orochimaru's activities ever since he left the village, and adds that at one point, Orochimaru joined a rogue organisation known as the Akatsuki, an organisation Itachi is a part of. Jiraiya also tells Kakashi that due to Naruto possessing the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside him, he will have to live the rest of his life watching his back, and therefore he will be taking over Naruto's training. Kakashi elaborates Itachi's words as meaning they want the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox for the Akatsuki. Angered that Kakashi knows of their organisation, Itachi instructs Kisame to kill Asuma and Kurenai, but to bring Kakashi with them. Before Kisame can do so, Might Guy arrives, forcing the two with no choice but to flee.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sasuke returns to the Uchiha Clan's basement and is angered as he remembers his clan's massacre.

She decides to bring some for Sasuke, and ponders whether to bring some for Naruto as well.

She had thanked Sasuke for saving her from Gaara, but he tells her that it was Naruto who saved her. Although Sakura initially believes that Sasuke is being modest, Sasuke adamantly states that it was Naruto, who showed newfound strength, who had saved her. Remembering this, Sakura decides to bring Naruto some dumplings as well.\\n\\nNaruto and Jiraiya are on their way to another town, as Naruto begins to wonder what kind of technique Jiraiya will teach him next. Naruto wonders why Jiraiya chose him to be his pupil, and Jiraiya mentions that Naruto reminds him of the Fourth Hokage, who he reveals was his student. Naruto is surprised, and asks who trained Jiraiya, to which Jiraiya states that his sensei was none other than the Third Hokage. Jiraiya asks whether Kakashi had done the bell test with Naruto, and Naruto admits that he was tied to a stump. Jiraiya laughs as he fondly remembers the same bell test being administered to him; while Orochimaru and Tsunade got the bells, Jiraiya was tied to a stump as well. Unbeknownst to Naruto or Jiraiya, they are being followed by Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki, both of whom decide not to engage in a fight against a legendary Sannin. \\n\\nBack in Konoha, Sasuke is training by himself in the woods, attempting to destroy rocks using his Chidori. He remembers Naruto's fight against Gaara, and muses how Naruto is getting stronger everyday. Wanting to be stronger as well, he goes off to find Kakashi. Following their fight, Guy, Asuma, and Kurenai take an unconscious Kakashi home to rest, where they decided that Sasuke should not know of Itachi's return. They stop discussing Itachi when Guy notices someone outside; Sasuke enters the room looking for Kakashi, only to be shocked that Kakashi is bedridden and that there are three jonin the in room. Aoba then barges in and loudly asks whether it's true that Itachi has returned and is after Naruto. Determined to protect Naruto from Itachi as well as kill Itachi for murdering the Uchiha clan, Sasuke rushes out to find Naruto, only to discover that Naruto had already left the village with Jiraiya. \\n\\nIn another town, Naruto sits in a hotel room training by himself while Jiraiya is out on a date with Emi, an attractive woman he had just met. Sasuke arrives in the town as well, visiting every single inn and hotel asking if a blond kid his age and an old man with white hair reside there. One such innkeeper tells Sasuke that there is such people in a room down the hall; Sasuke rushes down and knocks on the door. In his room, Naruto hears knocking on the door and believes it is Jiraiya.

Meanwhile, Sasuke is running through the streets, desperate to find Itachi. While running, he reminisces on his past. When he was younger, Sasuke had always looked up to his brother. One morning, he had asked Itachi to help him with his shuriken training, only for Itachi to brush him off. Sasuke then asked his father how come Itachi never had time for him. His father told Sasuke that Itachi was very closed off and distant, and that not even he knew his own son very well. Sasuke's mother then gave Sasuke his lunch, and Sasuke headed off to the Academy.\\n\\nOn the way there, he came across a relative of his, who mentioned that by his age, Itachi had already awakened his Sharingan and had become a genin. Sasuke was initially put down, but his uncle Teyaki assured him that in time, he would be a great shinobi as well, for he was an Uchiha like his brother. After school, Sasuke rushed home, fearing he was late as the sun had already set. Sasuke then noticed the bodies of his relatives littered across the streets, with blood, shuriken and kunai on the walls and doors. Fearful, Sasuke rushed home, only to find his parents dead. Realising it was Itachi who was responsible, Sasuke demanded to know why he had slaughtered their entire clan. Itachi claimed that he had murdered everyone to test his strength. Sasuke ran outside and begged to live, to which Itachi stated that he was not even worth killing. He then told Sasuke to live the rest of his life with hatred and vengeance towards him.\\n\\nBack in the present, as Kisame and Itachi contemplate how best to carry Naruto, Sasuke arrives. Kisame is shocked at seeing Sasuke, not only because he looks similar to Itachi, but because he too possesses the Sharingan. Itachi tells him that Sasuke is his younger brother, which Kisame finds funny as he had believed that Itachi had murdered every single Uchiha. Sasuke tells Itachi that he has been living this entire time with hatred in his heart, his only purpose in life to kill Itachi. Sasuke then rushes at Itachi with his Chidori. Uninterested in their quarrel, Itachi easily stops the attack. To try and help Sasuke, Naruto uses the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's chakra in an attempt to summon a toad, though Kisame uses his blade to absorb and devour the chakra. As Kisame prepares to attack Naruto, a toad arrives to block the would-be attack, followed by Jiraiya.\\n\"},\n",

Standing to his feet again, Sasuke tells Naruto to stay out of his own fight, but is easily beaten down by Itachi, who tells his brother that he is still too weak and he still hasn't mustered enough hatred. Deeming it necessary to make him stronger, Itachi activated Tsukuyomi and forced Sasuke to relive his parents' and other clan members deaths. As Naruto rushes forward to aid his comrade, Kisame prepared to attack him, but Jiraiya uses the Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique to stop the two Akatsuki members.\\n\\nThe entire area became the oesophagus of the Mountain Toad, with Kisame's foot and sword already starting to be absorbed as Jiraiya began explaining his technique. Sasuke was absorbed into the wall, thus being saved from Itachi. Itachi instructed Kisame that it was time to flee, knowing that the only way they could survive this technique was to escape. Itachi is forced to use Amaterasu to burn a hole in the toad's oesophagus, allowing them to escape; Jiraiya then seals away the flames, remarking that it had to be a powerful technique to burn through and allow them to escape. \\n\\nAs Jiraiya and Naruto are checking on Sasuke, Guy suddenly appears out of nowhere and kicks the Sannin in the face with his Dynamic Entry. He had thought that Naruto and Jiraiya were Itachi and Kisame after using the reflection from his forehead protector to check what was ahead. He had seen two figures in the dull reflection, so he had automatically assumed that Itachi and Kisame were still there. Naruto thinks back on Sasuke's defeat at Itachi's hands. He resolves to go after Itachi and Kisame for doing that to Sasuke, but is quickly shot down by a more realistic Jiraiya, who tells him that he is nowhere near Itachi and Kisame's league. Naruto learns that Kakashi was also struck with the same technique Itachi used on Sasuke, and Guy mentions that they need a medical specialist to help, not only with Kakashi and Sasuke, but with Lee as well.

Naruto finds Jiraiya in a room with two women drinking sake, infuriated that Jiraiya has spent all of his savings. As he lashes out at Jiraiya, two men enter the room, and Naruto accidentally throws the squid he was holding at the stranger's coat, creating a stain.

He then goes on to explain that popping the water balloon is only one of three steps to mastering the technique, and leaves Naruto to resume his training. Over the next three days, Naruto practices by himself in the woods as Jiraiya entertains himself with the women in town. He is unable to find success until he spots the hotel's cat spinning and bursting his water balloon. Seeing this, Naruto comes up with an idea to burst the water balloon – by keeping it steady in his left hand, he uses his right hand to create chakra and rotate the water inside the balloon in different directions until it pops. Although unorthodox, as it requires two hands instead of one, Jiraiya states that he has passed the first stage and that they are moving on to stage two.\\n\\nThe second stage involves bursting the balloon again; however, unlike the first, the second stage involves a rubber ball instead of a water balloon, making it harder to pop. Naruto demands help, but Jiraiya states that Naruto isn't a child anymore and that he must figure things out. As Naruto continues to train over the next several days, Jiraiya tells Naruto to go to town and fetch food for the two of them. While in town, Naruto witnesses a father and a son sharing a popsicle. Naruto asks Jiraiya if he'd be willing to stay and spend the day and help him, but Jiraiya repeats his earlier words and tells Naruto to do things himself.\\n\\nOver the next three weeks, Jiraiya leaves Naruto to his own devices and continues to mingle with the townswomen. Feeling immense pain in his arms and still unable to burst the balloon, Naruto decides to hold the balloon in both hands and force chakra into the balloon until it bursts, despite the pain he feels in both hands. Pushing himself to his limit, Naruto manages to cause a hole in the balloon. Although disappointed that he wasn't able to burst it, Naruto is congratulated by Jiraiya.

As Tayuya stands there confused, Shikamaru attempts to trap her using his Shadow Imitation Technique, but Tayuya manages to avoid being caught just in time. However, Naruto manages to get away, and follows Kimimaro. His anger towards the Sound Four and Kimimaro causes him to release some of the Nine-Tails' chakra. Naruto manages to catch up to Kimimaro in a clearing, and the latter is surprised to see that Naruto possesses much more chakra than most. Naruto demands to know why Orochimaru wants Sasuke. Kimimaro explains that Orochimaru wishes to live forever; while his soul can live forever, his body cannot, therefore Orochimaru must need new host bodies to use as vessels. Angered that Orochimaru is planning to take over Sasuke's body, Naruto uses the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra to produce a thousand shadow clones. Back in the forest, Tayuya mocks Shikamaru's leadership, believing he has sacrificed a member of his team every time they engage one of the Sound Four one-on-one. Shikamaru states that he does not believe any of his team members are dead, and tells Tayuya not to insult them. Tayuya responds by summoning three giants, whom she controls with her Demonic Flute. At the same time, Kiba is fighting Sakon, who manages to kick Kiba away. \\n\"},\n",

Using his remaining kunai and shuriken to distract her and her giants, he triggered a flash bomb he had planted above her. The light from the flash bomb extended his shadows long enough for him to trap all three of her creatures with his Shadow Imitation Technique. He then tells her that he will be using her very own pawns against her, but Tayuya does not seem to care. Shikamaru tells her to at least arm herself, and she tells him that her flute is her only weapon. Shikamaru and her creatures charge at Tayuya, but Tayuya is able to dispel her creatures. Shikamaru voices his frustration, causing Tayuya to laugh at him for thinking he had a chance. However, just as she attempts to kill him, she finds herself trapped by Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. He tells her that, just like in a game of shōgi, the first move is always a fakeout, whereas the second move is the final strike.\\n\\nTrapped and unable to move, Tayuya advanced her cursed seal to its second state in order to use the strength and chakra it provides to break free of Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. Shikamaru attempts to hold her in place with the advanced Shadow–Neck Binding Technique, which seems to work; however, while her body is kept bound by his jutsu, her fingers are free to move, and she uses her flute to place Shikamaru within a genjutsu. As the genjutsu causes Shikamaru to scream in pain, Tayuya picks up one of Shikamaru's kunai knives and rushes towards him to kill him. Just as she gets close, Shikamaru punches her in the gut. Wondering how he ever got out of her genjutsu, she notices that he had manipulated his shadow to break his own finger, and used the pain to break out of her genjutsu. Shikamaru then uses his Shadow-Neck Binding Technique on her again, telling her that the closer he is to his target, the tighter the bind his jutsu inflicts. As Tayuya berates herself for her carelessness, Shikamaru reveals that it was all according to his plan - once Tayuya revealed that her flute was her only weapon, he knew that once she thought she caught him, she would need to arm herself to kill him, and that she would pick up that kunai closest to her and come near him to finish him off. \\n\"},\n",

Gaara uses his sand to fight Kimimaro, which prompts Kimimaro to attempt to destroy Gaara's gourd, as he believes it is the only source of sand Gaara possesses. Gaara, however, uses the sand on the ground to restrain Kimimaro and then uses his Sand Drizzle technique followed with a Sand Binding Coffin, although Kimimaro avoids being crushed to death due to his bone density.

Stuck within the sand, Kimimaro reminisces on how he was raised in the darkness, imprisoned in a cell because of his kekkei genkai, only being let out to fight. The clan's patriarch used him as a weapon in an attempt to take down Kirigakure. Kimimaro was tasked with the sole objective of killing any ninja from Kirigakure, and encountered Orochimaru, Zabuza and Haku, the latter two telling Kimimaro that they were not from Kiri in order to avoid a fight. After killing all of those in his way, Kimimaro discovered that the entire Kaguya Clan has been slaughtered as well. Feeling lonely and without a purpose, Kimimaro wandered on his own until he was found by Orochimaru, who took him in.

Realising that in his current physical state that he is nothing but a burden, Lee relents and allows Gaara to fight alone. Kimimaro pulls out his spine and uses it to restrain Gaara. He then transforms his right hand into a bone drill in an attempt to bore through Gaara and kill him. Gaara manages to use the hardest minerals in the ground and fuses it into the sand with his chakra to summon his Ultimately Hard Absolute Defence: Shield of Shukaku, which is hard enough not only to prevent Kimimaro's bone drill from boring through but to shatter the bone completely.\\n\\nGaara realises that Kimimaro's technique is a kekkei genkai, and Kimimaro tells him that it is a trait that belonged to the Kaguya Clan, and that he is the last of the clan.

Almost depleted of his chakra, Gaara dispels his Shield of Shukaku while also using the sand around him to release himself from Kimimaro's spine grip.

Naruto asks whether Shikamaru is his opponent, and Shikamaru tells him that he has no clue what Naruto is talking about, as he is here only to drop off some paperwork. Tsunade tells Naruto that his opponent is right outside. Naruto then opens the window and sees his old sensei, Kakashi, sitting there reading Icha Icha. Naruto decides to bestow a present to Kakashi, and gives Kakashi the latest volume of Icha Icha that Jiraiya wrote, which has not even been released yet. Kakashi is overwhelmed, but Tsunade tells him to get a grip. Naruto then asks Kakashi if he is his opponent, and Kakashi states that he is both his and Sakura's opponent; Tsunade not only wished to test Naruto's training that Jiraiya put him under, but also the training she gave to Sakura. However, as Kakashi wants to start reading the book Naruto gave him, he tells Naruto that they cannot begin the exercise now since Naruto must be tired from his journey.\\n\\nAs Naruto berates Kakashi for leaving them just to read the book, Sakura decides that they should take the time to discuss an ample strategy to use against Kakashi. The pair are tailed by Shikamaru and Temari, prompting Naruto to bluntly ask them if they are a couple. Shikamaru and Temari both protest, and explain that they are both representatives of their respective villages for the upcoming Chūnin Exams. Shikamaru then asks Naruto if he is going to be participating in the exams, as he is the only one from their year who is still a genin. Naruto is shell-shocked at this revelation, after finding out that even Sakura made Chūnin. Shikamaru goes on to add that Neji, Kankurō and Temari have even reached Jōnin rank. Naruto is amazed that they have become Jōnin, but quickly interrupts himself to ask what became of Gaara, and finds out that Gaara has become the Kazekage of Sunagakure. He proudly announces that he will not be outdone by Gaara and that his dream is still to be Hokage.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya manages to locate Kakashi, who is reading his book. Kakashi and Jiraiya take a walk, and Jiraiya explains that he is now returning Naruto to Kakashi's care, and that Naruto must be ready to face the Akatsuki, who are coming out of the shadows and want Naruto due to the Nine-Tailed Fox he has sealed within him. Jiraiya tells Kakashi that he has alerted all of their neighboring allies about the Akatsuki, and that they should prepare themselves. In Suna, Baki tells Gaara that the councll is having a meeting. At the meeting, a Suna shinobi named Yūra explains that Suna has prospered the last few years, having adopted some of Konoha's methods. However, he also brings up the Akatsuki, and how Jiraiya warned him that they would be coming. After the meeting, Yūra clutches in head in pain, albeit dismissing it as a minor headache to a fellow shinobi.\\n\\nBack in Konoha, Naruto and Sakura are at the training grounds when Kakashi appears. Naruto and Sakura recall the training grounds as the location of their very first training test, and immediately reminisce on their memories of Team 7, back when Sasuke was on the team. The mere thought and mention of Sasuke bums the two out, but they are snapped out of it by the chime of bells. Kakashi tells them that they would be doing the same test they did the first time they became ninja, to take the bell from Kakashi. Naruto asks whether Kakashi would be reading the whole time, and Sakura adds that he most likely already finished. Kakashi tells them that he has not finished reading, but that he cannot afford to read during this exercise, as both Naruto and Sakura have been trained by a Sannin. Kakashi then raises his forehead protector, as he claims he would need his Sharingan to take on the two at once. The trio are being watched in the shadows by Jiraiya, Tsunade and Shizune, the latter three interested in the outcome of the match.\\n\\nIn Sunagakure, two Akatsuki members, Sasori and Deidara, arrive. Their secret agent Yūra manages to murder all of Suna's posted guards, allowing the pair access to the village.\\n\"},\n",

As Naruto jumps up into the air to evade the shuriken, Kakashi throws another set. Naruto, however, instantly uses his Shadow Clone Technique to produce a shadow clone in mid-air to pull him out of the shuriken's trajectory. His move impresses both Kakashi and Sakura. As both Naruto and the shadow clone land back on the ground, Naruto transforms his shadow clone into a giant shuriken, intend on hurling it at Kakashi. Kakashi manages to grab Naruto's hand before he can throw it, telling Naruto that his attack would not work. However, Naruto manages to have a shadow clone sneak up on Kakashi with a kunai; his timing and usage of his shadow clones impresses Kakashi once more, as well as Jiraiya, Tsunade and Shizune, who are observing the fight from the shadows. Kakashi tells Naruto that he is impatient as ever, as Naruto also attacked before Kakashi could officially begin during their first bell test. After he begins the match, Kakashi disappears and heads for the woods.\\n\\nSasori and Deidara easily enter Sunagakure after Yūra, Sasori's spy, killed the guards posted at the village's entrance. Creating a large clay bird as transportation, Deidara tells Sasori to hang back while he single-handedly proceeds to find the jinchūriki of Shukaku, Gaara. Deidara manages to incapacitate the guards tasked with watching the skies above Sunagakure with his explosive clays, moulded into the shapes of spiders. Deidara marvels at the artistic architecture of Suna, but claims that an explosion is the truest, most beautiful form of art, and therefore he will relish at Suna's destruction.\\n\\nBack in Konoha, Kakashi runs through the woods as he spots both Naruto and Sakura hiding behind their trees. He believes it to be a rookie mistake, and reminisces back to their first bell test, when Sakura and Sasuke managed to hide properly but Naruto could not. He is awakened from memory lane by shuriken hurtling towards him, thrown by Naruto. As he evades the attack, Sakura comes from behind and uses her massive strength to break the ground beneath him. Kakashi heads for the tree branches, only for Naruto use his Shadow Clone technique and send multiple shadow clones against him. Kakashi decides to use taijutsu to deal with the clones; however, after there are only three clones remaining, Kakashi opens the First Gate and uses the Front Lotus on the three Naruto shadow clones, both Naruto and Sakura recognising the technique as one Rock Lee uses. After the three shadow clones are taken care of, Kakashi wonders where the real one is, only for the real Naruto to announce his presence and come barrelling at Kakashi with the intent of using One Thousand Years of Death. Kakashi, horrified at the mere thought of being struck by that technique, evades the attack and retreats. \\n\\nAs Naruto and Sakura continue to head through the woods to find Kakashi, they are stopped in their tracks by an injured Sasuke. Struck with kunai in his body, Sasuke tells Naruto and Sakura that he managed to escape from Orochimaru and asks the pair to help him. Sakura, however, instantly recognises the trick as a genjutsu and dispels it, while at the same time pinpointing Kakashi's true location. Naruto then creates a shadow clone to prepare his Rasengan, and uses Rasengan on the tree that Kakashi is hiding behind. Kakashi manages to dodge the Rasengan, and ponders on a time when it was easier to fool Sakura with a genjutsu. Naruto claims that he would never fall for any of Kakashi's old tricks, only to spot the bells on the floor. Exclaiming that Kakashi must have dropped them while dodging, Naruto rushes towards them before Sakura can stop him. Naruto is ensnared by a rope before he can get the bells, prompting Kakashi to state that Naruto still falls for the same old tricks. However, the Naruto trapped by the rope turns out to be a shadow clone while the real Naruto, claiming an old trick like that would not work on him, rushes from behind and punches Kakashi right in the face, only for the latter to use a Body Replacement Technique and retreat once more.\\n\\nBack in Suna, Deidara believes his infiltration of the village to be successful only to be stopped by Gaara, who claims that this is as far as Deidara gets.\\n\"},\n",

As Deidara gets higher up into the air, Gaara uses his sand to create a platform in mid-air. The shinobi of Sunagakure, including Gaara's brother Kankurō, are on the ground witnessing the aerial battle. Deidara resorts to using his explosive clay to target Gaara, only for Gaara to absorb the damage with his sand and then have his sand reform. Deidara then resorts to using a much more powerful variant of his C1. Gaara is able to encase himself in a sand cocoon, while using his Third Eye to maintain his vision.

Unable to land a hit on Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura have no choice but to retreat and devise a new strategy. Kakashi also retreats, remarking how his Sharingan is exhausted by Naruto and Sakura's efforts. He contemplates taking the time to finish his Icha Icha book, but remembers that Naruto and Sakura are too tough for him to fight while simultaneously reading. \\n\\nNaruto remarks how Kakashi's intelligence exceeds Shikamaru's, how his sense of smell is greater than Kiba's, how his taijutsu surpasses that of Rock Lee's and how his Sharingan is more powerful than Sasuke's. Nonetheless, Sakura states that a great ninja like him must have some sort of a weakness. After deliberating on the thought, Naruto discovers Kakashi's weakness and shares it with Sakura.

Not wanting to hear spoilers, Kakashi covers his ears, but realises his Sharingan can still read Naruto's lips.

Kakashi tells her that the Akatsuki once came to Konoha in search of Naruto, but that it was three years ago.

Chiyo, however, sets the record straight, stating that the Akatsuki waited three years in order to properly prepare for the extraction of tailed beasts. When Sakura asks what she means, Chiyo is surprised that a student of Tsunade does not even know about the tailed beast that Konoha harbors. Kakashi tells Chiyo that the topic of the Nine-Tailed Fox is taboo in Konoha and is considered classified information. Chiyo goes on to explain that there are nine tailed beasts in the world, who are monstrous beings of chakra, and that many ninja villages fought for control over them for military purposes. She tells them that the One-Tailed Shukaku was in Suna's possession for many years, while the Nine-Tailed Fox was under Konoha's.

Nonetheless, she tells them that she has gone up against an Uchiha and their Sharingan in her youth and devises a plan of attack. Kakashi, however, states that her plan would not work since Itachi uses Mangekyō Sharingan. He recalls the last time he fought Itachi, in which Itachi placed him under Tsukuyomi, which caused Kakashi to undergo three days worth of torture and a week in a comatose state. Itachi is surprised to know that Kakashi has learned something from their last battle, but Kakashi goes on to add that using the Mangekyō Sharingan comes at a personal cost - risking the user's eyesight and causing permanent damage. Itachi commends Kakashi for learning about the Mangekyō Sharingan, and Kakashi responds by asking how damaged Itachi's eyes are, before raising his forehead protector to reveal his own Sharingan. Itachi is stunned by the move, and along with Kakashi's knowledge of the Mangekyō Sharingan, wonders if Kakashi himself possesses it. Kakashi tells his team that in order to fight Itachi, they must anticipate his moves by looking at his body instead of his eyes.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"The battle between Guy and Kisame intensifies. Guy brings out his nunchaku to compensate for Kisame's Samehada sword, but is unable to land a strike. Kisame uses his Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique to force Guy underwater, and follows up with his Water Release: Five Feeding Sharks technique. Guy uses his taijutsu to attack all five sharks, but the sharks use the water to regenerate from their injuries. As his team is reaching the end of their line in their water prison and unable to take down Kisame himself, Guy resorts to using the Eight Gates. Opening the first six gates, Guy is able to stand on the ocean floor, recover from his wounds and send all the water flying upwards. Neji uses the opportunity to emit chakra from his body, breaking out of his water prison. He then uses Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on the three Kisame water clones, freeing his team. Guy assumes his Morning Peacock stance, ready to defeat Kisame.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Naruto realises that he's in a genjutsu that Itachi cast upon him when the various Itachi he strikes transform into crows. Naruto wonders how Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu when he did not even look at his eyes, and Itachi states that he can cast genjutsu with his ring, which Naruto looked at. Itachi then prepares to put Naruto to sleep. Remembering Jiraiya's training regarding how to break out of a genjutsu, Naruto dispels the crows Itachi conjures, causing Itachi to remark that Naruto has grown.\\n\"},\n",

He is then released by Sakura and Chiyo. Kakashi tells Naruto to stay alert, while he rushes towards Itachi. Itachi uses Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, which Kakashi is able to zip through and avoid. Itachi launches his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique at Naruto, Sakura and Chiyo, and all three manage to avoid its path. Kakashi attempts to hit Itachi with his Lightning Cutter, but Itachi is able to jump into the air and evade the attack. However, Naruto attempts to hit Itachi in mid-air with his Rasengan. As Naruto makes contact, it turns out that that Itachi is a shadow clone.\\n\\nKakashi uses the Hiding in Mist Technique that he copied from Zabuza years ago to shroud the environment. Itachi claims it useless as his Sharingan can still see through the mist, and attempts to hit Kakashi with his Fireball Technique. Kakashi muses that something is off about Itachi, and goes under the ground in an attempt to use Earth Release: Double Suicide Decapitation Technique, but Itachi manages to avoid Kakashi's attack. Holding Kakashi in place, Itachi attempts to cast a genjutsu on Kakashi. The Kakashi in his grip, however, is a shadow clone, that now has a hold on Itachi. Kakashi tells Naruto to hit both his shadow clone and Kakashi. Since Itachi was able to counter his Rasengan, Naruto recalls his training with Jiraiya, in which Jiraiya reminds him that Rasengan is a jutsu created by the Fourth Hokage, and that Naruto should use his unique chakra to improve and create his own unique Rasengan, which would be the most powerful technique in his arsenal. Naruto decides now is a good time to use it, and thus, using a shadow clone, rushes at Itachi and the Kakashi shadow clone with his Big Ball Rasengan. The attack hits Itachi, but Itachi smirks at Naruto right as he is hit. Sakura and Chiyo marvel at the destructive power of Naruto's technique.\\n\\nAfter the technique subsides, the four are surprised to see that the dead body in front of them is not that of Itachi's, but of Yūra, an Anbu Commander and a Jōnin from Sunagakure. After Guy uses his Morning Peacock to destroy Kisame, Team Guy is surprised that the corpse lying in front of them is not that of Kisame's, but that of a stranger dressed in the Akatsuki cloak. Guy reaffirms his original feeling that he has never met the man lying in front of them before.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Team Kakashi and Team Guy are both able to come to the conclusion that the fight they had was nothing more than a distraction to prevent them from rescuing Gaara. Chiyo summons a mechanical bird to deliver a message to her brother Ebizō regarding Yūra, the man used as a sacrifice for Itachi. Chiyo explains that for the Akatsuki to use such a technique would mean that they have already begun the extraction. When Sakura asks what she means, Chiyo explains that the tailed beasts were often harnessed for their power by sealing them inside individuals. Those individuals would become host to the beast itself and would be able to keep the beast sealed within them while using the beast's power for themselves. Those individuals, known as jinchūriki, would however die if the beast was extracted from them. Chiyo explains that before Gaara, Sunagakure had two jinchūriki who had Shukaku sealed within them, and they died following the extraction. Sakura is angry that shinobi harnessed the power of the beasts during the war and is about to criticise the jinchūriki who were created, before stopping herself short when she realises that Naruto is a jinchūriki himself. Tearful at the idea of the Akatsuki killing Naruto by extracting the Nine-Tailed Fox out of him, Sakura is about to talk to Naruto when Naruto interrupts, telling them that they should be on the move if they expect to save Gaara.\\n\\nIn Suna, Kankurō stumbles out of bed when he hears that Chiyo has sent a message. He and Baki head to a Suna Council meeting, where it's revealed that Yura was indeed an Akatsuki spy, thus explaining how Sasori and Deidara got into the village undetected. Not wanting to wait for Gaara to return, the council deliberates on choosing a new Kazekage. Kankurō and Baki are appalled, stating that there is nothing that proves that Gaara will not return. A councilman, however, states that Gaara being gone is perhaps best for the village, since most of the village is fearful that the One-Tail Shukaku spirit within Gaara will be unleashed upon them. The council men decide that electing a new Kazekage would bring much needed stability to the village. Kankurō protests, but he is told that once before, the Third Kazekage, the strongest Kazekage Suna ever had, was also kidnapped. Suna had sent many recovery teams to locate him, but they could not even locate his corpse. To make matters worse, neighbouring nations attacked their village when it became known that the Kazekage was no more. Wanting to avoid a war and believing that it is best not to have Gaara in the village, the councilman decides a new Kazekage should be the best course of action. Kankurō tells the Council that while he agrees with their points, he still cannot write off Gaara's fate since Gaara is his little brother.\\n\\nKakashi notices that Naruto's pace has slowed down considerably, realising that he must be wiped out from using his Big Ball Rasengan. Kakashi calls for a break, which Chiyo calls a wise decision. Naruto protests, but Kakashi explains that if they were to rest up and then continue, they would reach Gaara much faster than if they continued at their current pace. Kakashi also adds that Naruto would have to be at his full strength in the event that he faces those who kidnapped Gaara. Meanwhile, Pakkun notices that Guy is in pain, due to the toll of opening the sixth gate. Lee asks him if he is okay, but Guy crashes into a tree branch and is knocked out. Neji decides that Guy deserves some rest after using the Morning Peacock, and they decide to take a break as well.\\n\\nBack at the Akatsuki hideout, the Akatsuki leader commends Itachi and Kisame for stalling the enemy. Sasori believes that he should be praised as well, since it was his two subordinates that were used as sacrifice for the leader's technique. The leader claims that it his technique that did the trick and that his two subordinates should be thankful for the opportunity to serve the Akatsuki, albeit a very brief opportunity. The leader then asks for a status report from Itachi. Itachi states that the Konoha shinobi were none another than Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno and the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto Uzumaki, along with Suna shinobi Lady Chiyo. Sasori is surprised to hear that his grandmother is on their pursuit. The leader of the Akatsuki then orders Zetsu to find the corpses of the sacrifices and to dispose of them.\\n\"},\n",

Neji notices that there is no one in their vicinity, meaning that their enemies are confident that they have been successfully delayed, which he finds uncomfortable. Chiyo and Kakashi come to the same conclusion as well. Naruto's anger and frustration causes him to slightly tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing his whiskers to become more prominent, changing his eyes from blue to red and increasing his stamina. Chiyo asks Kakashi why Naruto is so keen on rescuing Gaara when they're not even from the same village. Kakashi explains that Naruto is also a jinchūriki, that he harbors the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Fox within him. Kakashi tells her that since all jinchūriki are treated the same no matter what village they're raised in, Naruto understands the pain Gaara suffered through, and therefore he wishes to save Gaara from any more pain and suffering. Chiyo is surprised at this, and tells Kakashi that at her old age, she thought she knew how the world worked. She believed people only looked out of themselves and that alliances with neighbouring lands were nothing more than a farce. Wanting only to do what was best for Sunagakure, Chiyo tells Kakashi that it was she, with the permission of the Fourth Kazekage, who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Despite being an old woman, she believes that perhaps there is still something she could do for the good of the village.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Akatsuki finish sealing Shukaku inside of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The extraction kills Gaara, who in his last moments contemplates on the nature of his existence. Deidara states that the entire process took three days. Gaara's dead body falls the floor, and Deidara and Sasori prepare to deal with the intruders headed their way. Outside of the hideout, Team Guy arrive. Lee decides to break their way in, but Guy notices the barrier seal. At the same time, Team Kakashi arrive. Lee is ecstatic to see Naruto and Sakura once more, but Naruto, still under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, is too agitated and restless to have a reunion.

However, he manages to get a glimpse of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, though he is unable to explain what exactly it is. Guy attempts to break the boulder blocking their path, but is unable to do so due to the barrier seal on the boulder. Kakashi theorises that the Akatsuki must have used a Five-Seal Barrier. He explains that there are four other tags in the vicinity and that all five tags must be ripped off at the same time to deactivate the barrier. Using his Byakugan, Neji locates all the other tags, and using wireless headsets, Team Guy sets off to find the four barrier seals. Meanwhile, most of the Akatsuki members end their astral projection technique and leave the hideout. Deidara and Sasori, who are the only members to be physically present, are ordered by the Akatsuki leader to dispose of the intruders. However, he tells them that the Nine-Tails' Jinchūriki is to be captured alive. Although Naruto's capture was a task personally assigned to Itachi, Sasori is now given that responsibility. Itachi tells Sasori that Naruto is the one who rushes in and barks first. With that, Itachi and Kisame end their astral projection. The leader tells them that he expects results, and he too leaves. Deidara and Sasori then sit there waiting for their intruders to come to them.\\n\\nOn the outside, Team Guy locates the four tags. Kakashi rips off the one by the boulder at the same time that Team Guy rips off their seals, causing the barrier to break. Sakura uses her Chakra Enhanced Strength to shatter the boulder. With the entrance now open, the Kazekage Rescue Team use the Button Hook Entry to sneak in, although they are immediately greeted by Deidara and Sasori, who are sitting on Gaara's corpse. This infuriates Naruto to tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing his eyes to change from blue to red and for his whiskers to be defined more prominently. Sasori and Deidara realise that he is the jinchūriki that they must capture. Meanwhile, sudden blobs began to form in front of the respective members of Team Guy.\\n\"},\n",

However, Kakashi also tags along, telling Sakura and Chiyo to handle Sasori until Team Guy manages to return. Wanting to fight Naruto alone, Deidara tells Kakashi that Sasori is much stronger than him, and therefore he should go back in order to aid Sakura and Chiyo. Naruto agrees, but Kakashi remains. Kakashi decides to use his Sharingan against Deidara since the latter managed to defeat Gaara, who was a Kage. Deidara finds Naruto's behaviour odd, stating that with the exception of Gaara, they have killed two Jinchūriki before, and that no one came to their rescue; he adds that most people were actually glad to be rid of them. He understands that Naruto must have some desire to save another of his kind, but finds the notion pathetic.\\n\\nBack inside the Akatsuki hideout, Chiyo explains that the Sasori they see in front of them is not Sasori's actual body, but in fact a puppet named Hiruko. Sakura wonders where Sasori is, as she does not see someone behind Hiruko pulling his strings, and is shocked to learn that Sasori is operating Hiruko from within. Chiyo explains that since puppet masters are not good at close combat and rely on their puppets to attack, this leaves the puppeteers themselves vulnerable, hence why Sasori created Hiruko, to counteract that weakness. Chiyo reveals that Sasori was once a master puppeteer in Sunagakure, but at some point began to transform human corpses into human puppets, which Sasori considered a form of art. The puppet they see in front of them, Hiruko, is actually the body of a shinobi from a neighbouring village whose corpse Sasori used. Chiyo tells Sakura that she joined the Kazekage Rescue Team believing she could stop Sasori, as she knew how Hiruko operated, but reveals that Sasori has improved and refined the puppet. Nonetheless, they believe they have the advantage and Chiyo shares a secret with Sakura, which Sasori is unable to hear.\\n\\nFinally ready to start their battle, Chiyo and Sakura rush at Sasori/Hiruko. Sasori uses Prepared Puppet: Eight Waves of Needles, which causes poison-laced senbon to rapidly fire out of Hiruko's mouth. Both Chiyo and Sakura are able to dodge every single senbon. Sasori resorts to releasing Hiruko's arm and launching it as a projectile, which releases even more poison-laced senbon. Once more, Chiyo and Sakura are able to avoid every single one of them, to Sasori's disbelief. While he is able to understand Chiyo's masterful dodging, as she is an expert puppeteer herself, he is unable to comprehend how Sakura was able to do so as well. While Chiyo stands idly, Sakura rushes towards Hiruko. Sasori attempts to jab her using Hiruko's poison-tipped tail but his attack is blocked by Chiyo, leaving Hiruko vulnerable. Using her Chakra Enhanced Strength, Sakura lands a massive blow on Hiruko, destroying the human puppet. Sasori manages to get out of the rubble, but keeps his face covered. Chiyo demands that he turn around and face them, claiming she waited 20 years and travelled all this way just to see her grandson's face once more.\\n\"},\n",

Chiyo and Sakura are both unable to believe that Sasori has not aged in two decades. Meanwhile, Temari's team, along with Kankurō and Ebizō, decide to make their way towards the Land of Rivers, in order to support the Kazekage Rescue Team. Kankurō tells Temari to take a break, which Temari protests, until Kankurō points out the members of her team are exhausted and unable to continue. Although Temari is able to persuade them to push themselves past their limits in order to save their Kazekage, Ebizō tells the others to take notice of where they have stopped. Looking around, the team realise that they are standing on the same battlefield where Team Kakashi fought Itachi. Ebizō claims that since they are in Akatsuki territory, blindly rushing in, and to do so exhausted, would result in swift and sudden annihilation. While the team decides to rest, Ebizō tells them the tale of the strongest ninja in Sunagakure's history, the Third Kazekage, and how one day he was mysteriously kidnapped. He tells the Suna ninja that the village searched for him for years, with the Anbu even searching in secret. However, they were unable to find his corpse or even how he was kidnapped. Ebizō states that during the time that Suna searched for the Third Kazekage, the village entered into a state of panic that allowed enemy ninja from a rival village to invade Suna and cause a war. Believing that such bloodshed could have been avoided had Suna dealt with the crisis in a calm fashion, Ebizō tells the team not to repeat Suna's mistakes from the days of the Third Kazekage.\\n\\nBack in the Akatsuki hideout, Sasori uses Hiruko's head to launch another round of poison-tipped senbon, only for Sakura to dodge them all once more. However, this time he realises that it is Chiyo who is pulling the strings, using Sakura as her own human puppet. He then summons a new puppet to battle with, revealed to be none other than the Third Kazekage. Chiyo realises that it is Sasori who kidnapped and killed the Third around a decade ago, and is appalled to learn that he transformed the Third into a human puppet. While she finds his association with Akatsuki regrettable, she finds his betrayal to his village the most despicable, holding him responsible for the murders of the last three Kazekage - the Third, the fourth, and Gaara, the Fifth, despite Orochimaru killing the Fourth. Sasori claims that it was one of his spies that was complicit in the murder of the Fourth, but admits that the Akatsuki and Orochimaru have some shared history. Wanting some answers, Sakura tells Sasori that he will tell her what she wants to know. Not wanting to drag out their fight, as he needs to aid Deidara outside capture Naruto, Sasori uses the Third Kazekage puppet to launch more poison senbon towards Sakura; Chiyo manages to have Sakura evade the attack successfully. Using the Third Kazekage's poison blades, Sasori tries to stab Sakura, but the attack is blocked by Hiruko's tail, which Chiyo controls with her chakra threads. However, the blades are powerful enough to break Hiruko's already powerful tail. Having no other method to protect Sakura, Chiyo is unable to block Sasori's Thousand Hands Manipulation Force. However, she is able to masterfully control Sakura to avoid any damage and pull her out of harm's way. Sasori counters by releasing poison gas, knowing that despite Chiyo controlling Sakura, there is no way she could prevent Sakura from inhaling the fumes.\\n\\nOn the outside, Deidara flies away with Gaara's corpse, prompting Naruto to follow him.

Chiyo attempts to attack Sasori using the head of the Third Kazekage puppet, but Sasori incinerates it. Sasori switches tactics and uses his Water Stream Shooters to destroy the rocks and the surrounding environment. Using the poison stinger attached to the coiled rope from his puppet body, Sasori attempts to stab them, but Sakura, who is still under the effects of the antidote, grabs the poisoned coiled rope and uses her strength to pull it. Sasori deems the action useless and charges at Chiyo, spinning the propeller blades attached to his body at a high speed. Before he can decimate Chiyo, Sakura manages to pull all of the rope, halting his attack and sending him flying towards her.

Neji uses his Byakugan and verifies to the team that Sakura and Chiyo have managed to defeat Sasori. However, because the clones still exist, Neji theorises that perhaps it must have been Deidara who cast the jutsu, although he also adds the possibility that even if the caster is defeated, the jutsu will still continue.\\n\\nBack in the cave, Sakura heads to the exit to the cave as Chiyo collapses, due to the poison in her system. Having no more antidote on her, she tells Chiyo that they should rush back to Sunagakure, where she will send a request to Konoha to send her the materials she needs to make more antidote. Chiyo, however, does not wish to return yet, as she believes she has not finished with her duty yet.\\n\\nOutside, Naruto and Kakashi continue to pursue Deidara, the latter now wielding his Mangekyō Sharingan. Naruto tells Kakashi that even his newfound Sharingan technique does not work, he himself will find a way to defeat Deidara. Meanwhile, Team Guy continues to fight their clones, although they get beaten as their clones seem stronger. Neji tells them that the clones have not gotten stronger, but that they have gotten weaker. Since they are of flesh and blood, they can get tired and exhausted, but the clones have no such drawbacks. Lee, however, theorises that since the clones maintain the exact same level of strength as they had the moment they ripped off the seals, then they would simply need to be stronger than they were then. Tenten finds the idea of gaining extra strength in a short time ludicrous, but Lee recalls back to their training days, where their team motto was to be stronger than they were yesterday. Lee tells them that his own personal credo is to be stronger than he was a minute ago, and manages to use Youth Full Power to defeat his clone. Tenten uses Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain Disaster, which is a stronger version of her Twin Rising Dragons technique, to impale her clone; Guy uses Leaf Great Flash to take down his clone; and Neji uses Eight Trigrams Mountain Crusher, which is a stronger version of his Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm, to send his clone flying through a boulder, defeating it.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Sakura and Chiyo follow Naruto and Kakashi's trail, but the poison in Chiyo's body slows her progress down significantly, almost causing her to fall off. Sakura notices that she should be knocked out by now, and that it is only the sheer force of her will that is keeping her conscious. Sakura attempts to persuade her to return to Sunagakure to be treated, but she tells Sakura that she still has something left to do. Supporting Chiyo, Sakura continues to follow their trail, recalling Naruto's anger at Deidara when the latter sat on Gaara's body and declared that the Kazekage was dead.\\n\\nNaruto and Kakashi continue to pursue Deidara, who is flying above them on his giant clay bird. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan's inter-dimensional warping technique, Kamui, Kakashi attempts to force Deidara into a vortex. He struggles with using a jutsu of this magnitude and is unable to kill Deidara, but manages to warp and rip his right arm off. Having no arms left, as his left arm was crushed and removed by Gaara's Sand Binding Coffin during their fight, Deidara attempts to flee. Kakashi attempts to use Kamui again, but Deidara is able to fly and avoid being sucked in once more. Kakashi is exhausted from using his Mangekyō Sharingan and is forced to stop and rest. Seeing this, Deidara believes he has successfully escaped and lets down his guard, only for Naruto and his shadow clone to rush at Deidara in mid-air with Rasengan. Deidara leaps out of the way, but Naruto's Rasengan manages to hit his clay bird, tearing it in two. Creating two more shadow clones, Naruto catches the front part of the bird and pries Gaara's body out its mouth. He pleads with Gaara to wake up, but finally realises in anguish that Gaara is dead.\\n\\nHaving defeated their clones, Team Guy sets off to provide backup for Team Kakashi. Guy attempts to communicate using their wireless radio, but is out of range. He asks Neji to spot them, and the latter uses his Byakugan to report that Naruto and Kakashi have successfully rescued Gaara, although he then notices that Gaara is dead.\\n\\nAngered that the Akatsuki have claimed Gaara's life, Naruto vows to avenge his friend. Deidara tells Naruto that perhaps they will face off sometime in the future. Kakashi alerts Deidara that he has let his guard down once more, and the real Naruto, under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, appears behind Deidara and punches him the ground. Creating more shadow clones, the clones each grab on to one of Deidara's limbs as the Akatsuki member crashes on to the hard ground, landing on his back. Naruto then leaps from the tree and lands forcefully on Deidara himself, and proceeds to pummel Deidara's face until Naruto's knuckles are bloodied. Wanting to kill Deidara, Naruto prepares his Rasengan and drives it into Deidara's stomach. Deidara manages to use Body Replacement Technique, avoiding the damage. Full of hatred towards Deidara and anger towards Gaara's death, Naruto begins to draw out more of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing the red chakra to envelop around Naruto and forming a red chakra tail, transforming the jinchūriki into his One-Tailed form.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'Naruto begins to shroud himself with the Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s chakra, entering his Version 1 form, sprouting a single chakra tail. He attempts to locate Deidara, but to no avail. Kakashi recalls Jiraiya warning him about Naruto\\'s \"Nine-Tailed Cloak Form\", telling him to stop the transformation before Naruto grows a second tail. In order to halt the transformation, he gave Kakashi a seal that would suppress all the chakra in Naruto\\'s body. Naruto then begins to grow a second tail, the additional chakra causing his shadow clones to feel a burning sensation, with the shadow clone near Kakashi dispelling itseld out of pain. Naruto rushes towards the woods, destroying the trees in his vicinity. Kakashi leaps down and attempts to calm him down, only for Naruto launch an attack at Kakashi. Kakashi dodges it and stamps the seal on Naruto\\'s forehead protector, shutting down his chakra and reverting him back to normal.\\n\\nAs Naruto\\'s transformation subsides, Sakura and Chiyo arrive, where the pair announce that Sasori has been dealt with. Surprised that the two kunoichi killed Sasori, Deidara attempts to slither out of the bush he is hiding in and to escape, only for his path to be blocked by Team Guy, who had used Neji\\'s Byakugan to locate him. Deidara is impressed with the Hyūga Clan\\'s kekkei genkai, wondering how it compares against the Uchiha Clan\\'s Sharingan, but adds that he does not have the time to stick around and find out. Team Guy attempts to stop his escape; despite having no arms, Deidara swiftly dodges Tenten, Guy and Lee. Neji, however, manages to hit with his Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm. Deidara survives the attack and heads towards the body of his giant clay bird, using his teeth to bite off a chunk of the clay and converting it to explosive clay using his mouth. Deidara then swells up and seemingly self-detonates; Team Guy attempts to escape the blast radius, but the range of the explosion is too big. However, the explosion is countered by Kakashi\\'s Kamui, which is able to warp it to a different dimension just in time, although the usage of his Mangekyō Sharingan causes Kakashi to collapse.\\n\\nNaruto\\'s shadow clones, carrying Gaara\\'s body, regroup with the others. Naruto asks Sakura if there is anything she could do to save Gaara, still clinging on to the hope that he may be resuscitated. Sakura attempts to do so, but fails. Naruto cries out in anger over Gaara having being killed despite just recently reaching his dream of being Kazekage. He begins to weep, claiming that he was not able to save Sasuke and despite training for three years, he was unable to save Gaara. When Chiyo tells him to calm down, he lashes out of her, blaming her and the rest of Sunagakure for sealing Shukaku inside Gaara. He holds them responsible as they did not take Gaara\\'s feelings or life into consideration, and detests them to sealing tailed beasts inside of people to create jinchūriki, claiming that they had no right to alter that person\\'s life or fate in anyway whatsoever. Naruto\\'s words cut deep wounds for Chiyo, as she was the one who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Wanting to atone for her past, she decides to resurrect Gaara at the cost of her own life.\\n'},\n",

Naruto attempts to interfere, but is stopped by Sakura, who tells him that she is bringing him back from the dead. Neji believes that such a convenient jutsu must come at a personal cost, a thought shared by Kakashi. Chiyo is unable to successfully resurrect Gaara, due to her low chakra levels. Naruto, however, offers his own chakra. Chiyo recalls Kakashi's remarks on Naruto; a jinchūriki like Gaara, he is the only one who understands Gaara's pain and suffering, hence his intense desire to save Gaara. Using Naruto's chakra to supplement her technique, she tells him that his power to make friends with anyone will result in him being a Hokage the world has yet to see the likes of; she also tells Sakura that one day she will surpass Tsunade. Chiyo hopes for a brighter future for both Sunagakure and Konohagakure, a future where both Naruto and Gaara will make sure that the world is not like how it was in Chiyo's time. She remarks that everything she has done for Suna her whole life has been wrong, and that resurrecting Gaara is the only thing she has done right.\\n\\nGaara's spirit returns to his body, as he sees himself as a younger child crying all alone. However, he is surprised when he sees and feels a young Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him. As he opens his eyes, he is shocked to find himself in the real world with Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him, the latter glad to see Gaara once more. Gaara notices that nearly every member of Suna's military are also there, all of them cheering and crying out of happiness. Kankurō thanks Naruto for saving Gaara, but Naruto tells him to thank Chiyo, who he believes simply passed out from resurrecting Gaara. Kankurō, however, explains to him and everyone else that Chiyo is dead, having given up her life in exchange for Gaara's. Temari tells Naruto that he really does have the power to change people, adding that Chiyo would have never given up her life to revive a Kazekage or a jinchūriki until she met Naruto; Kakashi adds that she died passing on the future to Naruto and Gaara. Sakura cries, and Chiyo's brother Ebizō notes how peaceful she looks and how he half-expects her to start laughing (as a callback to when she used to fake her death near him as a joke). Naruto remarks that she died in a selfless matter similar to the Third Hokage, and Gaara, managing to stand up on his feet, calls for a prayer to commemorate Chiyo's actions and bid her farewell.\\n\"},\n",

Although he believed the technique would have done the trick, he is grateful that he was able to survive due to the attack. Having only lost his right arm from the elbow down, he decides to search for its remains, as well as the Akatsuki ring that was on its finger.\\n\\nBack at the Akatsuki hideout, Zetsu arrives to scope out the aftermath of Sasori's battle, with his subordinate Tobi in tow. Zetsu finds Sasori's body and notes that he had never known how Sasori looked like before. Tobi manages to locate Sasori's Akatsuki ring, and asks if he can keep it and use it to fill the now empty spot in Akatsuki's ranks. Zetsu berates him for acting foolish, and Tobi responds in kind by accidentally dropping the ring into a crevice in the ground. \\n\\nIn Sunagakure, all of its citizens, including Baki, eagerly await by the border for the return of their Kazekage. They are overjoyed when they spot the Three Sand Siblings, Konoha's response team and Suna's own rescue unit. The citizens of Suna cheerfully celebrate the successful recovery of their leader. Gaara decides to let Chiyo's corpse be carried into the village first, as a sign of respect. As Gaara resumes office, Baki and Temari attempt to persuade Naruto and the others to stay in the village for a day or two, in order to recover and recuperate from their wounds. Kakashi and Sakura tell them that they must return and report to Tsunade regarding the completion of their mission. A report is sent in advance by Takamaru to Konoha, however the fates of Deidara and Sasori are omitted by Kakashi, who wishes to discuss it in person instead. With that, the Konoha shinobi depart back home, although not before stopping and paying their respects at Chiyo's grave. During their walk back to the village, Tenten pressures Guy to hurry up, who is lagging behind supporting Kakashi. Not wanting the others to wait for him, he tosses Kakashi in the air, placing his own backpack on his front and catching Kakashi in a piggyback fashion, which the others, especially Naruto and Sakura, find uncomfortable. Carrying Kakashi on his back, Guy uses his speed to run past them, telling them to catch up. Lee attempts to do the same with Neji, but the latter flat-out refuses.\\n\\nIn Konoha, Shizune receives the mission report from Suna and reports its success to Tsunade. Shizune expresses her concern over Tsunade's decision to send Naruto to engage against the Akatsuki, especially since Naruto, as a jinchūriki, is a target of the Akatsuki. Tsunade explains the reasoning behind her actions, telling Shizune that only a jinchūriki can truly understand another jinchūriki, and that Naruto has the ability for others to rely and depend on him.\\n\\nIn the woods near the Land of Rivers, Tobi and Zetsu locate Deidara's arm, with the former believing that Deidara is dead, having been blown to pieces. Deidara arrives at the same time, telling Tobi to drop his arm. Zetsu asks Deidara whether he had captured Naruto, but Deidara tells him that he had already done his duty (capturing Gaara). When Tobi mocks him, Deidara tells Tobi that if he were to bother him for a third time, he would react in kind. Tobi asks whether Deidara would proceed to blow him up; Zetsu responds that his reply counts as a third infraction, prompting Deidara to put Tobi in a neck hold using his legs.\\n\\nIn Konoha, a mysterious old man tells his pupil that he has arranged for him to be placed in Team Kakashi, with his mission being to keep an eye on Naruto Uzumaki. The man tells his pupil that from this moment onward, until the completion of his mission, his name is to be Sai. Sai accepts the name and responds by smiling. The man tells Sai to wipe the fake smile off his face, and Sai tells him that he had heard that smiling is a way to win people over, albeit revealing that he has trouble forming facial expressions.\\n\"},\n",

They notice a tremor, which ends up being Might Guy, running into the village at top speed with Kakashi on his back. Declaring himself as first place, he is soon caught up with by Lee, who declares himself second. Guy tells Lee that he is third and that Kakashi is second, causing Lee to tear up. This is witnessed not only by Izumo and Kotetsu, but by Naruto, Sakura, Tenten and Neji, who have caught up to them as well. The teams then head to the hospital in order to admit Kakashi, who is unable to move after having used his Mangekyō Sharingan during his fight with Akatsuki member Deidara with Tsunade revealing that Kakashi will be bedridden for an entire week as a result of the battle.\\n\\nAfter Kakashi is admitted to the hospital, Sakura sprints off to the balcony, which Naruto notices. On the balcony, she notifies Tsunade and Shizune of Sasori's last words - that one of his spies, who works for Orochimaru, is supposed to be meeting him six days from now at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure. Tsunade brings up the idea that Sasori's final words may be a trap by Akatsuki, using the mention of Orochimaru's name as bait. Sakura is still adamant on going, claiming that they will defeat any Akatsuki member they encounter. Tsunade approves the quest, but tells Sakura that since Kakashi is unable to move for a week and that the rendez-vous is in six days, she will need to find a new team member to replace him on the mission. Shizune protests that she'll need to find two, since she believes Naruto should not go on any mission involving Akatsuki interference, and offers her own team. Tsunade responds that Naruto and Sakura are both driven by a need to save Sasuke, to the point where they would give their lives for him, and therefore possess the determination and will to complete the mission successfully, which is what sets them apart from Shizune's team. She also asks Shizune what Naruto would say if he had overheard her; Naruto happens to be standing on the roof, having heard the entire conversation. He announces that he will be on the search for a new team mate and heads off. Tsunade finds Naruto impatient, claiming she hadn't finished her speech about him, while Shizune muses on Tsunade's words (how Naruto has the power to make people rely and depend on him) and remembers that he is the one who won the First Hokage's necklace.\\n\\nIn the village, Naruto begins his quest to find a new teammate, musing that the teammate needs to be someone who is strong enough not to hold them back, someone who is friend in order for teamwork to be efficient, yet someone who is not too attractive as to distract Sakura. His outspoken thoughts are heard by Shino, who tells Naruto that it has been a while since they've met. Naruto is unable to recognise Shino immediately, insulting Shino, who believes that friends shouldn't forget one another. Their conversation is cut short by Kiba, who lands on Shino. Kiba is riding on Akamaru, who has grown to the point where he is big enough to sit on. Naruto recognises Kiba and Akamaru instantly, much to Shino's dismay. Naruto asks Kiba to join him on his mission, but Kiba states that Team 8 has already been assigned a mission and that they are simply waiting for Kurenai. Naruto spots Hinata watching them from afar, the latter of which is shy and embarrassed about encountering Naruto; Hinata faints when Naruto meets her face-to-face. As she recovers, Naruto asks Shino if he could help on their mission, since he considers Akamaru to be big enough to count as a member of a three-man squad. Shino simply remarks that Naruto was able to recognise Hinata as well, irritating Naruto. Naruto then asks Hinata to leave her team and to come with him; his words cause Hinata to go red in the face and to faint again.\\n\\nNaruto decides to ask Shikamaru for help, but the latter has been assigned by Tsunade to oversee the Chūnin Exams. Chōji appears, carrying Shikamaru's lunch and happy to have a reunion with Naruto. Chōji is willing to come with Naruto on his mission, despite already being assigned to a mission along with Asuma and Ino. Naruto mentions that Chōji has gained weight since they last met, prompting Shikamaru to tackle Naruto while Chōji expands his left arm. At that same moment, a beast made of ink comes charging at them, which Chōji manages to easily destroy. The attack seems to come from a Konoha shinobi (Sai), who is watching the trio from afar. Shikamaru decides to hold Sai in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique, and tells Naruto to handle the situation. Naruto heads towards Sai, only for Sai to paint six more beasts and bring them to life, sending them towards Naruto.\\n\"},\n",

Shizune voices her concern once more about Tsunade\\'s decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki. Shizune\\'s concerns lie regarding the fact that Naruto may be captured by the Akatsuki. Sakura recalls when Deidara attempted to catch Naruto, only to be stopped by Kakashi. She too becomes worried that without Kakashi on their team, the Akatsuki may succeed in their mission. Tsunade, understanding her worry, decides to appoint another member to their team as well, claiming that her two replacements will fill the positions on Team 7 left open by Kakashi and Sasuke.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Naruto rushes towards Sai, who has sent his six ink beasts to engage Naruto. Shikamaru uses his Shadow Sewing Technique to puncture the beasts, leaving Naruto free to attack Sai with a kunai; Sai blocks the move with his sword. When Sai mentions that Naruto is weak and does not have any balls, Naruto becomes infuriated. Shikamaru attempts to ensnare Sai using his Shadow Imitation Technique, but Sai jumps in mid-air to avoid it. Naruto demands to know who Sai is, but Sai responds that Naruto will soon find out. He then disappears using his Ink Mist Technique. As he disappears, Ino shows up, looking for Chōji. She spots Naruto and is overjoyed, citing him to be a sight for sore eyes.\\n\\nTsunade is called into a meeting by the village elders, members of the Konoha Council. They tell her that Shizune has been meeting with them recently to discuss Tsunade\\'s decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki, and tell Tsunade to limit the amount of missions Naruto goes on and to never let him outside the village. They go on to state that as a jinchūriki, he deserves to be kept confined and observed at all times, and thus believe their solution to be a compromise. The elders also state that if Naruto is ever to be given a mission, he is to be guarded by a member of the Anbu black ops at all times. Tsunade refuses to impose their restrictions on Naruto, believing Naruto to be a great ninja and asset to Konoha. However, she agrees that Team Kakashi should be restored to its original four-man state, and agrees to the elders\\' decision to assign a member to their team to keep on eye on Naruto. The two village elders call in Danzō, another village elder, who has selected a candidate from his Root programme to be Sasuke\\'s replacement on Team Kakashi. Tsunade accepts the decision, but notifies them that Kakashi is out of commission, and thus she will be choosing a replacement for Kakashi as well. The elders state that the replacement must be from the Anbu as well. Tsunade agrees, and leaves the room.\\n\\nOn her way back to her office, she berates Shizune for her betrayal, but also voices her distrust of Danzō. She is also angered that Danzō suggested the same thing to the village elders that she was about to (having an Anbu member placed on Team Kakashi). Needing to find another Anbu member to take Kakashi\\'s place, she summons an Anbu captain, to whom she bestows the name \"Yamato\". Yamato accepts his name, and is told to remove his mask as his mission is not an Anbu one. Yamato is given orders to not only keep an eye on Naruto, but to keep an eye on whomever Danzō had chosen to fill in for Sasuke. She explains that Danzō was an ardent opponent of her sensei, the Third Hokage, who also did not trust Danzō. She adds that Danzō was also responsible for forming a clandestine training unit known as Root, and despite the fact that the unit was disbanded officially years ago, she still suspects that Danzō is associated with it. Since Danzō\\'s candidate is also tied to Root, she orders Yamato to keep tabs on him.\\n\\nNaruto and Sakura then meet up at the spot where Tsunade had told them to go, the former glad that they are getting two new teammates. However, Naruto becomes incensed when he realises that Sasuke\\'s replacement is none other than Sai; Yamato greets them as their new captain, but instantly recognises that the animosity between Naruto and Sai will be a challenge for him.\\n'},\n",

Sai explains that his actions were merely to test Naruto's power, to which he has deduced that Naruto is nothing but a mere weakling. Naruto takes offence at his words, and attempts to strike Sai, only to be held back by Sakura. Sakura berates Sai's actions, but Sai states that he likes everyone, including ugly girls like Sakura. This only infuriates Sakura, but she is held back by Yamato before she can attack him. Yamato tells the team that their mission is to apprehend Sasori's spy at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure, and that the successful completion of their mission will lead to the assassination of Orochimaru and possible retrieval of former Team Kakashi member Sasuke Uchiha. With that, Yamato dismisses the team, telling them to gather their belongings and to meet him at the front gates in an hour.\\n\\nSai heads to his room, packing his gear, when he is attacked by a mysterious man. The man is revealed to be a member of the Anbu, who came to provide a secret report commissioned by their superior, Danzō Shimura. After noticing that Sai is taking a remnant of his childhood with him, the man tells Sai to remember that as members of Root, they are to have no feelings or emotion, as they are the invisible root, the foundation, that holds up the tree known as Konohagakure. With that, the man departs. Naruto and Sakura walk back to their homes, with Sakura remarking that Sai reminds her of Sasuke. Naruto dismisses her opinion, citing that Sasuke is a million times better than Sai could ever be. Sakura and Naruto then go to their respective homes to pack their gear. Naruto glances at the official team photo of Team 7 and renews his original vow to rescue Sasuke.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya arrives at the hospital to visit Kakashi. Giving Kakashi two volumes of Icha Icha, he states that he is also there to discuss something, although they must wait for Tsunade and Yamato. Although Kakashi does not recognise the name of Yamato, he is told by Jiraiya that it is a code name and that he would recognise the man when he saw him. Tsunade and Yamato soon arrive at the hospital; Yamato is briefed by Kakashi regarding Naruto's Version 1 form, in which the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra would envelop Naruto, causing him to sprout a chakra tail and go berserk. Yamato is visibly stunned by this, and Kakashi explains that by using a Chakra-Suppressing Seal, he was able to stop Naruto at just two tails. Jiraiya, who was unaware that Naruto had activated the form in his last mission, becomes grim. Kakashi asks Jiraiya how many tails he himself had seen; taking off his shirt, Jiraiya tells them that he had only been close to death twice in his life. He explains that the first time was when he was caught peeking into a ladies' hot springs by Tsunade, at which the point Tsunade broke his arms and ribs and crushed his internal organs. Showing them a scar on his torso, he explains that the second time was when Naruto entered into a four-tailed version of the Nine-Tails' cloak. This visibly worries the group, due to the fact that Naruto is able to grow up to nine tails.\\n\\nReady to meet Yamato, Sai and Naruto, Sakura spots Tsunade and Shizune returning from the hospital. She asks if they could speak before she departs, and they convene in Tsunade's office. Tsunade asks Sakura to brief her regarding their initial encounter with Sai. Just then, Danzō enters the room, asking whether Tsunade has appointed an Anbu member on Team Kakashi. Tsunade tells him that Kakashi's replacement was a member of the Anbu from the Third Hokage's time; this prompts Danzō to state that he wishes that the replacement is not as passive or gentle as Sarutobi was, claiming that Sarutobi's gutless actions were unwarranted. As he leaves, Sakura asks who he is. Tsunade tells her that Danzō was a rival of her sensei, who also vied for the position of Hokage. She explains that unlike the Third's pacifist nature, Danzō is a hardened man of military mind, and that the two are polar opposites. While she herself does not trust Danzō, she tells Sakura that Danzō himself despises her for being the granddaughter of the First Hokage, whose teachings the Third passed on (thereby making him a passive fool in Danzō's eyes) and for being the student of the Third herself. Sakura then realises she's almost out of time and with Tsunade's blessing, she heads to the front gates to meet the rest of her team.\\n\\nAs the four members of Team Kakashi arrive at the gate, Yamato leads them on as they depart the village.\\n\"},\n",

Tsunade pins the blame on Shizune, claiming that if Shizune hadn't approached the village elders of the Konoha Council, then Sai would not have been added to the team. Shizune justifies her actions by telling Tsunade that she did not think that they would appoint one of Danzō's Root members to Team Kakashi. Tsunade orders Shizune to find out what Danzō is up to and who exactly Sai is, and adds that she is counting on Sakura to diffuse any tension between Naruto and Sai.

Yamato tells them that he had hoped Kakashi had taught them the value of teamwork during his tenure as team leader, and tells the group that a team needs to be founded on teamwork and trust. Naruto retorts that Sai will never be considered a true member of Team Kakashi, and that the one and only fourth member will always be Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto tells Sai that he is nothing but a stand in for Sasuke; Sai replies that he is glad that he is nothing like Sasuke as he views Sasuke to be a traitor. Naruto almost attacks Sai, but his attack is stopped by Sakura. Sakura asks Sai to forgive Naruto, telling him that Naruto is only acting the way he is because he hasn't gotten around to knowing Sai. She flashes Sai a smile, which lowers his guard. Sakura then proceeds to punch him in the face, sending him flying across the ground. Sakura tells him that while she may ask him to forgive Naruto, she does not care whether he forgives her. She warns him that if he utters any more remarks regarding Sasuke, she will not hold back next time. Sai resolves to keep his mouth shut around her, but thanks her for the opportunity for showing him that a fake smile could be used to cover a sneak attack.

Sakura is shocked by his usage of Wood Release, since the one and only user is said to be the First Hokage, and wonders how Yamato is able to use it.\\n\\nYamato tells the team that they can either spend their time locked in the wooden cage or spend the rest of the day at a hot springs. The team chooses the latter, and they rest at a hot spring. Yamato tells Sai and Naruto that there is no better way to bond than to be naked and together in a hot spring. Naruto gets up, visibly discomforted by Yamato's words, only for Sai to remark that he is surprised that Naruto has balls after all. Naruto goes on a loud, verbal tirade regarding Sai's remarks regarding testicles, which the women on the other side of the hot springs overhear and laugh about; Sakura is embarrassed by Naruto and Sai. Naruto hears the laughter and becomes embarrassed himself, and Sai tells him that at least he gave Sakura a laugh. Realising that Sakura is nude on the other side of the fence, he decides to peek. Yamato, however, tells him that Jiraiya almost died when he had both of his arms and his ribs broken and his internal organs crushed, which was caused by Tsunade when he peeked on her at a hot spring. He warns Naruto that Sakura would do the same, and Naruto is paralysed in fear, staying firmly rooted in his place as Sai and Yamato exit the spring.\\n\\nAfter their dip in the springs, the three shinobi are greeted by a feast laid out in front of this eyes. Naruto hopes that Yamato remains as their team leader if a feast awaits them during every mission, an opinion Sakura echoes. Yamato reveals that he had paid for the hot springs and for the meal out of his pocket, in an attempt to boost team morale. The team then head off to bed.\\n\\nThe next morning, Sai gets dressed and slips out of the window while Naruto continues to sleep. Sakura wakes up, and looking out her window, spots Sai suspiciously walking on a wall.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'Naruto and Sai are hiding behind a rock observing the Tenchi Bridge when they spot Orochimaru\\'s subordinate on the bridge. Naruto hears the sound of a bell and turns around to see Sasori, inside of his Hiruko puppet and dressed in the Akatsuki robe, walking towards the bridge. As \"Sasori\" gives a thumbs-up, Naruto and Sai launch an attack on the spy, who happens to be Yamato in disguise, \"Sasori/Hiruko\" being Sakura in disguise. Naruto and Sai attempt to use taijutsu to attack Yamato, but Yamato is able to avoid all of them and kick Naruto, citing that their attacks are not good enough. Naruto and Sai head towards Yamato once more, criss-crossing diagonally. Sai holds his right hand behind him so that Naruto can create a Rasengan in Sai\\'s palm, but Yamato is able to his Wood Release ability to cause roots to sprout from the ground, entangling Sai. Sai, however, is revealed to be none other than a Naruto shadow clone. Naruto tackles Yamato, and the real Sai, hiding behind a tree, uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to paint a snake and bring it to \"life\". He sends it to wrap itself around Naruto and Yamato, but the latter uses a Body Replacement Technique to avoid being tied. Sai runs off in search of the real Yamato, leaving Naruto tied up.\\n\\nNaruto and Sakura manage to locate Sai in the forest, who has captured Yamato. Yamato mentally remarks that Sai\\'s skill level is too high for him to just be an alternate on this team, and believes that Tsunade had reason to doubt his placement. Sai also notes that Sakura\\'s strength is impressive, as she managed to rip his ink snake apart, and makes a note to avoid being hit by her. Naruto angrily asks Sai if he knows what the meaning of comrade is. Sai writes out of the word comrade on a scroll, irritating Naruto, who wants to know why Sai left him tied up. Sai explains that there was no reason for Naruto make his shadow clone look like Sai if he was going to have the Sai shadow clone perform a jutsu only the real Naruto knew; by doing so, he had revealed to Yamato that the real Sai was in hiding elsewhere. When Yamato had used a Body Replacement technique to avoid the binding, Naruto had lost his cool; thus Sai decided that since he could not find and capture Yamato while also looking out for someone like Naruto, he would simply keep the latter bound until the mission was complete. Naruto begins to walk off in anger, but Sai asks him why he is so keen on saving a comrade like Sasuke when Sasuke chose to abandon his friends and Konoha for Orochimaru. Naruto clenches his fists in anger, causing Yamato to fear that Naruto will enter his Version 2 form. However, Naruto simply states that he would do anything to save a comrade, even if it means working with someone like Sai.\\n\\nSakura explains to Sai that Sasuke is like a brother to Naruto, and asks him to sympathise as he has a brother as well. Sai reveals that his brother had died, and that he had no clue how one would look like if they had lost a brother. He wonders if the look on Naruto\\'s face is the same look. Sakura is taken aback by his words, and Sai reminds her that he does not feel any emotions. Yamato tells the team to go back to their wooden house for the night, and Sakura tells Sai that is he is lucky. She reminds him that she had told him earlier that she would not hold back if he spoke ill of Sasuke again; however, like Naruto, she is willing to tolerate him if it means saving Sasuke. Yamato then dispels the \"Tenchi Bridge\" (a fake created using Wood Release), and the team return to their camp, where they prepare to meet up with Orochimaru\\'s spy the next day at the real Tenchi Bridge.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'Yamato signals for the rest of Team Kakashi to join him on Tenchi Bridge. Kabuto and Orochimaru are amused to see Naruto and Sakura again, the latter musing whether he should bring Sasuke here to pit him against the jinchūriki. Naruto, who is already under the influence of the Nine-Tails\\' chakra, begins to enter into his one-tailed form. Sakura and Sai watch in a mix of shock and surprise as the chakra surrounding Naruto\\'s body begins to engulf the air. As Orochimaru mentions Sasuke\\'s name again, Naruto grows a second tail and rushes at him with superhuman speed, punching Orochimaru in the face and causing him to go through several yards worth of trees. As Orochimaru makes his way back to the bridge, the part of his face where Naruto struck him has peeled, revealing the face of Gen\\'yūmaru, the host body Orochimaru is currently occupying. Using his Face Copying Technique, Orochimaru reapplies his face as he remarks how Naruto is finally beginning to act like a jinchūriki; Kabuto himself states that Naruto, using the Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s power, has grown considerably in strength.\\n\\nYamato recalls his conversation with Jiraiya, Tsunade and Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, where Kakashi and Jiraiya were warning him about Naruto\\'s \"Nine-Tails\\' Cloak Form\". Jiraiya had told Yamato that other than the time where Tsunade nearly killed him for peeking on her when she was nude, the only other time he had almost died was when Naruto entered his four-tailed form. Jiraiya explained that whenever Naruto gave in to anger, the Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s chakra would begin to leak out and envelop him. As Naruto\\'s anger and rage grew, he would begin to grow more tails. On top of that, Naruto could only maintain his consciousness up to three tails; if he were to grow a fourth, his mind would succumb to the Nine-Tails\\' influence and he would instinctively attack on pure rage alone. Jiraiya likens Naruto\\'s Version 2 form to being a mini version of the Nine-Tailed Fox itself. Jiraiya revealed to the group that when Naruto enters into his four-tailed form, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox burns his skin off, causing immense pain and leaving Naruto to be covered by just blood and chakra. After the transformation subsides, the Nine-Tails\\' chakra then begins to heal him; the process of egregious damage followed by rapid recovery is shortening Naruto\\'s lifespan. Tsunade had asked how this is even possible, and Jiraiya had explained that the seal the Fourth Hokage had used was beginning to weaken over time, explaining why Naruto was succumbing to the Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s chakra much more during his bouts of anger as opposed to when he was younger. Tsunade, Jiraiya and Kakashi tell Yamato that he is the only one who can keep Naruto in check since he has the power of the First Hokage in his blood.\\n\\nBack on the bridge, Orochimaru realises that Yamato is team captain only because Naruto is a jinchūriki, citing that Konoha should be grateful for his experiments. When Kabuto asks what he means, Orochimaru reveals that back when he was a Konoha shinobi, he harvested DNA cells from the remains of the First Hokage and attempted to transplant them into babies and children; none of them survived, however. Before he could officially terminate the experiment and dispose of the subjects, he had been caught by the Third Hokage with another experiment in another laboratory, forcing him to flee Konoha. He realises that one of those babies who had been injected with the First Hokage\\'s cells had survived, and that the child is none other than Yamato. Sakura recalls Yamato creating the wooden cage and how she wondered how Yamato was able to use the First\\'s technique, and finally understands the reasoning. Orochimaru adds that the First Hokage had the ability to control tailed beasts, and that since Yamato has the power of the First within him, Konoha assigned him to keep watch on Naruto and control him if need be. \\n\\nWhen Naruto demands that Orochimaru and Kabuto return Sasuke to them, the duo state that Sasuke came to them of his own accord. Orochimaru tells Naruto that if he wishes to know anything about Sasuke then he would have to beat it out of him. Naruto gives in even more to the Nine-Tails\\' influence and grows a third tail. The sprouting of the third tail causes the chakra in the air to intensify, causing a burning sensation to everyone else on the bridge. Sai realises that Naruto\\'s true power comes from the demon fox, and Orochimaru, after staring into Naruto\\'s changing pupils, senses the burgeoning Nine-Tailed Fox within. Naruto\\'s three-tailed form then begins to form a chakra vortex above them.\\n'},\n",

Kabuto, sensing the attack, decides to strike Naruto from behind with his Chakra Scalpel. Naruto notices him coming and emits a roar, and his chakra sends Kabuto flying backwards into Sakura, knocking her out. Kabuto continues to soar through the bridge, with Sai and Yamato moving out of the way, as he crashes into a tree in the woods. Naruto's attack ends up destroying the Tenchi Bridge, and he goes after Orochimaru, who is on the other side of the bridge. Sai claims that it is the perfect time for his real mission to start, and using his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique creates a giant ink bird. He begins to fly in Naruto and Orochimaru's direction while Sakura, who is knocked out, begins to fall off the bridge. Yamato asks Sai to catch her, but Sai, despite being able to do so, avoids her and lets her fall. Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to steady the collapsing bridge and to catch Sakura.\\n\\nOn the other side, the three-tailed Naruto manages to rip Orochimaru's arm off. Orochimaru, however, uses a body replacement technique that causes him to materialise and regurgitate a new body from his mouth, restoring the limb he had lost. Orochimaru claims that Naruto still isn't good enough and that he's not as strong as Sasuke. In the woods, Kabuto uses his chakra to heal his wounds, while remarking that he finally understands why the Akatsuki are after Naruto, having experienced a sample of the true power of a jinchūriki.\\n\\nNaruto begins to fade into the recesses of his mind, where he finds himself in a dark area covered with water. However, as the light appears, he sees Sasuke running. Naruto attempts to follow him, but is unable to run through the water quickly enough to catch Sasuke, who is riding on top of the water. As the water rises, Naruto struggles to move underwater as Sasuke disappears from view. Naruto recalls his last fight with Sasuke, and how he was unable to prevent his friend from defecting and joining Orochimaru. He berates himself for lacking the strength to stop Sasuke, and vows that he will not allow Sasuke to break the bond of friendship they have between them. Naruto then begins to float through the water until he reaches a huge cage. Naruto begins to slip through the bars of the cage, which is where the Nine-Tailed Fox is imprisoned. The demon fox holds Naruto in his palms as he begins to allow his power to take over Naruto.\\n\\nIn the real world, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox begins to rip, burn and peel away Naruto's skin, leaving just blood and chakra; his peeled skin is soon incinerated by the chakra. Naruto sprouts a fourth tail, and enters into his Version 2 form. Yamato and Sakura notices a smoke-like trail left by his chakra while Sai observes the transformation from above. Yamato stays with Sakura while creating a wood clone to find Naruto. Naruto's painful transformation causes him to emanate a wave of chakra, which cracks the trees around them and bursts the giant ink bird Sai is riding on. The Yamato wood clone manages to protect itself by using Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall, forming a wooden shield. Orochimaru, who also survives the attack, states that Naruto has managed to pique his interest, and wonders what the outcome will be. The Yamato wood clone then sees Naruto's four-tailed form, and curses himself for being unable to prevent it. Naruto, now having no skin, no conscious hold on his body and covered only in blood and chakra, lets out a devastating roar.\\n\"},\n",

Orochimaru attempts to use his snakes to grab a hold of Naruto, but the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra end up incinerating the snakes. As the chakra begins to burn Orochimaru as well, he uses his body replacement technique to regurgitate a new body out of his mouth before the old one is incinerated. Retaining the bottom half of a snake, he slithers in a rapid manner towards Naruto and punches Naruto in the face. Naruto is able to grow another fox head and claws out his chakra and manages to bisect Orochimaru. Using his Gathering of the Snakes technique, Orochimaru is able to connect and regenerate both of his halves. He attempts to finish Naruto off by spitting out one thousand snakes, each armed with a sword in their mouths. However, Naruto uses one hand to create a devastating blast of pure chakra that incinerates the snakes and sends Orochimaru flying. Sai and the Yamato wood clone are unable to interfere due to the intensity of the battle; the wood clone, however, informs Yamato that Naruto has indeed reached his four-tailed form.\\n\\nSakura and Yamato are approached on the remains of the Tenchi Bridge by Kabuto, who wonders how Konoha knew that he was to meet Sasori at this time and place. Kabuto states that not even the other Akatsuki members knew of the meeting, and since Sasori isn't the type to give up information under torture, he must have been captured or killed. When Sakura tells him that it's the latter, Kabuto finds joy in it. He tells Yamato and Sakura that Sasori bore a grudge towards Orochimaru and always claimed that he would kill him, and therefore must have told them about his secret meeting in order for them to kill Orochimaru on his behalf.\\n\\nOn the other side of the destroyed bridge, Naruto prepares himself to use the ultimate tailed beast technique - Tailed Beast Ball. Yamato's wood clone wonders how Naruto is still able to move despite having so much chakra on his body, and Orochimaru echoes the sentiment, claiming that that degree of dense chakra should weigh him down. As Naruto swallows the chakra balls, the increased density does indeed cause him to sink into the ground; nonetheless, he fires the Tailed Beast Bomb as a beam towards Orochimaru. The Sannin tries to block the move by summoning Triple Rashōmon, one of his highest defensive techniques, but the Triple Rashōmon is completely obliterated by the Tailed Beast Bomb. At the end of his rope, Orochimaru resorts to using his Sword of Kusanagi in an attempt to impale Naruto. While the sword does hit him, it does not impale; instead, Naruto is send flying through the air and into a wall near the bridge. Sakura, Yamato and Kabuto witness Naruto's four-tailed form for the first time, and Kabuto remarks that this is the closest Naruto has ever gotten to fully transforming into the Nine-Tailed Fox; Sakura is terrified at Naruto's appearance.\\n\"},\n",

Sai is observing Orochimaru, unaware that he is being watched by Yamato's wood clone. Orochimaru states that Gen'yūmaru's body is beginning to reject him and that he is at his limit right now, though he comforts himself over the thought of still having Sasuke.\\n\\nKabuto states that he is surprised that Naruto would go this far to save Sasuke, claiming that the boy is gone and only the monster remains. His words cause Sakura to remember Naruto's promise to her - that he would bring Sasuke back no matter what, and that as his nindo, he would not go back on his promise. Sakura runs towards him in tears, despite Yamato's warning. She attempts to tell Naruto to change back, but Naruto simply smacks her aside with his tail, harming her. Before he can kill her, Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to create tree trunks to bind Naruto. Kabuto heads towards Sakura, and Yamato, believing that he is about to finish off a wounded Sakura, binds him as well. Kabuto tells him that he is actually attempting to save Sakura, and he heals her wounds to the best of his ability. He tells them that they share a common enemy - the Akatsuki - and that he is sparing and saving their lives just so that they can continue to dwindle down their numbers. As Kabuto leaves, Naruto manages to break out of the wooden restraints. Yamato uses the Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands, which utilises the power of the First Hokage's Wood Release and the crystal gem in the First Hokage's Necklace (which Naruto is wearing) to suppress and seal a tailed beast's chakra. With excruciating effort and pain on both Yamato and Naruto's side, Yamato begins to revert Naruto back to his humane self.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sai approaches Orochimaru, claiming that he means no harm and that he is only an envoy of Danzō Shimura sent to relay a message.

The real Sai pops out of the ground, and Orochimaru tells him to prove that he can be trusted. As he attempts to retrieve something out of his pack, he is tackled by Kabuto.

Sakura notices that all of Naruto's skin has been burned off and that he is extremely wounded, and uses her Mystical Palm Technique to regenerate his skin. As she heals him, she asks Yamato to teach her his technique, but the captain explains that only he can perform that technique as he carries the DNA of the First Hokage within him. He tells her that the necklace that Naruto wears, which is the First Hokage's Necklace, is made of a special gem that is able to control a jinchūriki or a tailed beast when conjoined with the First Hokage's chakra, and therefore only those who have his cells can replicate it, although to a lesser degree than the First could have himself.\\n\\nSakura manages to regenerate Naruto's burned skin and Naruto regains consciousness.

Yamato also reveals that Tsunade handpicked every member of Konoha's current hierarchy and everyone she selected also possesses those principles. Since Danzō does not agree with those principles, it is very likely that he is planning to collaborate with Orochimaru to destroy Konoha, so that Tsunade would become ousted as Hokage following the aftermath, allowing Danzō to become the new Hokage and to subsequently rebuild the village as he sees fit. Sakura deduces that while Orochimaru failed last time, Danzō is most likely offering internal support this time around, with Sai being the mutual conduit.

Kabuto remembers his Bingo Book task and realises that he left the envelope in Sai's room, and decides to head back. He begins walking down the corridor, unaware that Team Kakashi is running down an adjacent corridor looking for Sai as well. In his room, Sai begins to peruse the contents of the book and freezes as he hears the sound of his door unlock.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Team Kakashi enter Sai's room, with Yamato using his Wood Release: Hand Tool Manipulation technique to make his finger into a key. Sakura returns his picture book to him, which Sai appreciates. Naruto angrily questions Sai over his betrayal of the team. As his mission was to keep his agenda a secret from Team Kakashi, Sai declares his mission a failure, and since he cannot overpower the three of them at once, he decides to reveal his true mission to them. In order to gain control over Konoha, Danzō had sent him to be Orochimaru's aide, conspiring with him to destroy Konoha. Sakura remembers the loss of life the last time Orochimaru had attempted to destroy Konoha, including the death of the Third Hokage, but Sai is indifferent. Yamato explains that Sai is from Root, a special unit formed by Danzō that utilises specialised training in order to suppress emotions; he adds that the training is similar to those used in Kirigakure. Naruto remembers that that is the village where Zabuza hails from, and recalls his encounter with the famous swordsman, who revealed that Kiri's graduation exam entailed the murder of classmates in order to pass.\\n\\nSakura, however, does not believe that emotions can be suppressed completely, citing that Sai's appreciation over gaining his picture book back is proof of it. She goes on to state that his care for the book is due to the fact that is the only thing that reminds him that he has a brother whom he shared a bond with. Sai claims that there was no such bond, and adds that his name isn't even Sai; rather, he has no name and his mere existence is to serve as Danzō's tool. He does reveal that his brother isn't his actual blood brother, but merely a fellow boy he grew up with inside of Root. Yamato believes that Sai ended up murdering his brother, but Sai, with a tinge of emotion, tells them that he did not murder his brother, and that the latter succumbed to illness. Sai had been drawing his picture book to present it to him as a gift, but when his brother died, Sai did not have idea how to finish the book and suppressed any personal thoughts thereafter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kabuto is headed back to Sai's room in order to retrieve the envelope he left there, which contains the personnel files of Konoha's Anbu personally assigned to the Hokage Guard Platoon. However, as he unlocks the door, he finds the room empty, with no trace of the envelope. Team Kakashi, along with Sai, had relocated on the surface outside of the base. Using his Wood Release, Yamato binds Sai. Naruto states that with Sai out of the way, their mission is to save Sasuke, just like it was before. Sai is confused over his motives, and reveals that he had just met Sasuke a short while ago, and that Sasuke showed no concern for Naruto. Sai is unable to comprehend why Naruto would want to save someone who does not want to be saved, who does not reciprocate the same bond Naruto seems to share with him, especially when he is not under direct orders to do so. Naruto tells Sai that there was a time when he hated Sasuke, as Sasuke was top of the class while he himself was at the bottom. However, over time the two forged a bond, and Naruto credits Sasuke as the first person to truly accept him. Naruto claims that it is due to that bond that he will protect Sasuke, even if it means taking down Orochimaru, who Sai told them was always with Sasuke. Sai is slightly moved by Naruto's words, but remains indifferent. Naruto, however, prepares himself to go rescue Sasuke.\\n\"},\n",

He is surprised that they tracked them, but reminds himself that Yamato is one of Orochimaru's experiments after all. Naruto tells Kabuto to butt off, but when Kabuto refuses, Naruto comes rushing at him with Rasengan. When Kabuto manages to easily avoid and dispel the Rasengan, Naruto decides to attack him head on with his Shadow Clone Technique. Kabuto breaks one of Naruto's wrists and uses his Chakra Scalpel to take out the other Naruto's. Yamato uses his Wood Release to trap Kabuto, who jumps in mid-air to avoid being hit. Sakura climbs up the wood structures and attempts to hit Kabuto with her Chakra Enhanced Strength; Kabuto, who has the captured Sai in tow, manages to move out of the way, but Sakura's strike punches a hole through the rock, destroying a hornet's nest and causing the hornets to attack Kabuto.\\n\\nUsing his chakra scalpel, Kabuto strikes and defeats all of the hornets. Believing himself to be outmatched by the three shinobi, he frees Sai, whom he still trusts. Kabuto calls Naruto pathetic for continuing to go after Sasuke, claiming that as people change, Sasuke isn't the same person he once knew. Sai recalls Naruto explaining his bond with Sasuke and decides to sneak attack Kabuto from behind, restraining him. Sai explains that he would like to see the bond between Naruto and Sasuke with his own eyes; when Kabuto asks what he is doing, Sai merely repeats Kabuto's words about people being able to change.\\n\\nYamato uses his Wood Release to keep Kabuto bound while the team prepares to infiltrate the hideout once more. Kabuto reveals that by now, Sasuke would have finished his training with Orochimaru and thus is probably taking a rest in one of the rooms. Naruto and Sakura are excited to realise that Sasuke truly is inside the hideout, but before they can head out, Kabuto warns them that there are tons of empty rooms and isolated hallways, and while it is possible they may locate Sasuke, chances are they might accidentally enter Orochimaru's private chambers. Nonetheless, the team decide to take the risk and go find Sasuke, with Yamato leaving a wood clone to watch over Kabuto.\\n\\nIn the hideout, Yamato splits themselves into teams - he and Sakura on one team, and Naruto and Sai on the other. Sai agrees, and Naruto relents as he is willing to do anything to save Sasuke. The four go checking many rooms for Sasuke, but find them all empty. Naruto and Sakura each reminisce on their memories with Sasuke, and Naruto, who is running down a hallway, shouts out Sasuke's name. Sasuke, who is sleeping in a room, is awakened by the call and opens a Sharingan activated eye, only to close it a moment after.\\n\"},\n",

As Naruto falls unconscious, Sai carries him to the side. Sakura and Yamato continue searching each rooms, with Sakura getting impatient as they find themselves unable to locate Sasuke. Yamato warns Sakura not to rush in blindly, reminding her that they are in Orochimaru's lair and that there may be traps in place. Up on the surface, the Yamato wood clone continues to watch over Kabuto, who claims that the only map of the hideout is in his mind. Yamato's wood clone refuses to take Kabuto back to the hideout, unaware that the latter has prepared a Chakra Scalpel behind his back.\\n\\nAs Naruto regains consciousness, Sai tells him that Naruto reminds him of his adoptive brother. Sai recalls his memories with his brother and finally remembers what he wanted to draw, and quickly paints a picture of his brother and him smiling and holding hands. He tells Naruto that this was their dream, and that Naruto reminds him of his brother. Their conversation is interrupted by Orochimaru, who stumbles onto them while walking down a corridor. He uses his Hidden Shadow Snake Hands technique to attack them, but the two evade. Naruto tells Sai to rescue Sasuke while he handles Orochimaru. As Sai sets off, Naruto prepares to fight the Sannin, and uses Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto's infused chakra activates the tracking seed he had swallowed, and Yamato is signalled to the crisis. With his shadow clones, Naruto attempts to fight off Orochimaru, who uses his snakes and swords to dispel the shadow clones; Naruto hit a snake with Rasengan but finds himself caught by another snake. Orochimaru wonders whether this is the strongest Naruto can be; Naruto considers tapping into the Nine-Tails' power but remembers Yamato's warning, and decides against it, not wanting to risk losing control and hurting one of his teammates. Orochimaru decides to kill Naruto, but his attack is blocked by Yamato's Wood Release. \\n\\nSai, who theorises that Naruto's bout with Orochimaru should not only take time but summon Sakura and Yamato as well, takes the opportunity to use his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to create several ink rats to find Sasuke. Orochimaru senses Sai and spares Team Kakashi's life for the time being, asking them to repay him by killing off more Akatsuki members. Sakura asks where Sai is, and Naruto tells him that Sai went off looking for Sasuke. Sakura notices that Sai left his backpack and she smiles as she realises that he finished his picture book. Yamato finds a Bingo Book among Sai's belongings, surprised that he would even have such a thing in his possession. He explains to the duo that the Bingo Book has a list of individuals who are meant to be assassinated, and that if Sai has the book, then he must be on an assassination mission. Yamato, Sakura and Naruto are then shocked to see Sasuke's face inside the Bingo Book, and realise that Sai's true mission may be assassinating Sasuke. Meanwhile, one of his Sai's rats locates Sasuke's room and Sai opens the door, seeing Sasuke lying on his side with his Uchiha Clan symbol facing the door. \\n\"},\n",

Sasuke states that he did not kill Naruto because he did not want to obtain power the way Itachi did, as Itachi had told him to kill his best friend in order to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan. When Naruto claims he does not understand, Sasuke retorts that he does need to explain himself, and uses his immensely fast speed to appear in front of Naruto on the ground. He asks Naruto whether it his still his dream to be Hokage, and tells him that his years spend chasing after him would have been better spent had he trained instead. Naruto muses that he cannot be Hokage if he could not even manage to save his friend. Pulling out his sword, Sasuke tells Naruto that while he spared his life last time, he has no qualms about killing him as they no longer share a bond. He attempts to stab Naruto in the back, but the attack is blocked by Sai. Sasuke praises Sai's block but emits Chidori as a current out of his body, repelling both Naruto and Sai and knocking them out.\\n\\nSakura, remembering her vow not to be weak and be able to protect Naruto and bring Sasuke back, attempts to use her Chakra Enhanced Strength to strike Sasuke. Sasuke's Sharingan eyes predicts her movements, and he channels his Chidori into his sword, preparing to attack.

Naruto regains consciousness and begins to fall under the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, while the First Hokage's Necklace lies on the ground. The fox attempts to communicate with Naruto from within, telling Naruto to remove the seal and use all of its power. Naruto attempts to dismiss the fox, but the fox claims that Naruto has always used his power in his time of need and that without it, he would be weak. Before Naruto can do anything, Sasuke appears, much to his and the fox's surprise. Sasuke realises that the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox is the source of Naruto's true power and is surprised that Naruto had the spirit inside of him. The demon fox is impressed that Sasuke is able to see him inside of Naruto via his Sharingan and remarks that his physical appearance along with his kekkei genkai being much advanced than his years would belie makes him a spitting image of Madara Uchiha from the elder days. Sasuke manages to burst the demon fox's chakra, telling the fox that he does not recognise the name nor does he care. Both the fox and Naruto are astonished that Sasuke was able to suppress the tailed beast's chakra, but before subsiding, he warns Sasuke not to kill Naruto.\\n\\nIn the real world, Naruto awakens back in his normal state as Sasuke looks at him. Yamato uses his Wood Release to force Sasuke's Chidori-enhanced katana out of his torso and attempts to trap him using his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall technique to form a wooden dome around Sasuke.

Sai is in the Konoha Library reading books on how to create and forge friendships. Sakura spots him in the library and invites him to come with her and Naruto to visit Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, stating that as a member of Team Kakashi, he should meet their leader. Naruto is sitting on some steps, musing over Sasuke's remarks about giving himself over to Orochimaru if it ensured exacting his vengeance upon Itachi. He is broken out of his reverie by Sakura, although he is irritated to see Sai. As Sakura calls Naruto a dummy, Sai remembers an excerpt from the library book that explained how friends use nicknames to breed familiarity and sustain a friendship. He asks Sakura and Naruto if he may enter their conversation, surprising them. He reveals what he was doing in the library, to their astonishment. Sakura is taken aback by his desire to form a friendship while Naruto, who did not think Sai would ever care about their friendship, tells him not to worry and to let it come naturally. Wanting to create nicknames for the two, Sai is unable to find the correct words and is told by Sakura to use personality traits as a basis. After checking Sakura out, which causes her to blushes, he smiles and calls her ugly; Naruto attempts to restrain her, but she proceeds to beat both him and Sai up.\\n\\nAs they visit Kakashi in the hospital, Kakashi notices that Naruto and Sai are bruised and wonders if the two got into a fight. Naruto attempts to tell Kakashi that they met Sasuke, but Kakashi tells them that he already knows as Yamato had debriefed him. Naruto and Sakura remark that Sasuke has gotten exceedingly strong, the latter even believing that he may be undertaking drug enhancement under Kabuto's supervision in order to accelerate his growth. Kakashi states that the team would simply have to get stronger, especially Naruto, to whom he has devised a new training strategy. When Naruto inquires about the strategy, Kakashi tells him that the two of them will be creating a brand new, unique ninjutsu technique more powerful than the Rasengan that only he would be able to use. Before they can get into the specifics, Asuma and the rest of Team 10 enter the room. Asuma wishes to speak to Kakashi in private while telling Teams 7 and 10 to enjoy a barbeque lunch on his behalf. Ino notices Sai and develops an infatuation on him; Shikamaru and Chōji also notice and remember Sai, but Sai introduces himself to them and explains the reasoning behind his attack, which was to test Naruto since they were going to be teammates. Shikamaru privately tells Naruto that Tsunade had informed him about his encounter with Sasuke, and now that the Chūnin Exams were over, he would be free to tag along the next time. He does, however, remark that Naruto has missed the exams due to his mission and therefore is still a genin.\\n\\nShikamaru excuses himself from the restaurant in order to help the Nara clan with some medicinal task, although his true motive is to join Asuma and Kakashi's conversation regarding the Akatsuki. Asuma states that word of their activities has increased outside of the village, and due to their hunt for tailed beasts, it would only be a matter of time before they reached Konoha. Shikamaru also wonders whether Naruto would be able to defend himself, seeing as Gaara, who is a Kage, lost. Kakashi states that Naruto will get strong enough in time.\\n\\nAt the restaurant, Ino sits next to Sai in an attempt to be close to him. Chōji is told by Ino to introduce himself to Sai before eating, and Sai, wanting to create a nickname for him based on personality traits, begins to call him a fatso; however, both Naruto and Sakura predict his choice of words and Naruto gets up and covers his mouth, telling Sai that fatso is not an acceptable word to call Chōji. Sai realises that certain words are not acceptable to use as nicknames, and after his incident with Sakura, believes that women do not like to be called what they look like; instead, he chooses to refer to women as the opposite of what they are. After looking at Ino, he decides to call her beautiful. Naruto sighs in relief as Sai has finally managed to compliment a girl without her beating him up, but looks to Sakura to see how she would react; Sakura, irked that Sai called her ugly but called Ino beautiful, proceeds to trash the restaurant and pounds Sai.\\n\\nOutside the village, two grave robbers ransack graves, only to claim that they haven't found whom they're looking for.\\n\"},\n",

Kakashi tells him to dispel his clones in order to gain the cumulative knowledge, but after Naruto almost faints, he also mentions that Naruto would gain cumulative fatigue. Not wanting to give up when he feels so close, Naruto uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to resume his training once more, this time with all the shadow clones possessing the prior knowledge and experience. Struck with a thought, Naruto asks Kakashi whether there are any other shinobi in Konoha who possess Wind Release, in order for him to ask them for advice. Kakashi tells him that he does know one person who does, who would most likely be playing shōgi at the moment.\\n\\nAt the same time, Asuma Sarutobi and Shikamaru are playing shōgi, with the winner having to pay for Team Asuma's next post-win barbecue. Asuma loses the game, but Shikamaru's victory is cut short by the arrival of Naruto, who wishes to have Asuma give him tips on wind-natured chakra. Shikamaru is in disbelief that Naruto is attempting chakra nature training, claiming it to be too difficult for Naruto to master. Asuma himself is surprised that Naruto is a wind nature type, but agrees to give advice if Naruto is willing to pick up Team Asuma's tab on their next dinner. After checking Gama-chan, his frog purse, Naruto claims he has just enough money to do so, and agrees. Asuma produces his Chakra Blades, and infuses them with his wind-type chakra. Naruto attempts to do so as well, albeit not to the same degree as Asuma's, the latter claiming that Naruto should grind his chakra against one another. Naruto questions why one would infuse their chakra into blades when the blades are already sharp as is. Asuma tells Naruto to throw the blades at the trees; when Naruto does so, it hits a tree, but Asuma's goes through the tree and penetrates a boulder. He tells Naruto that he was holding back and that he could have gone through the boulder as well. Naruto enthusiastically thanks Asuma for his advice, which Asuma promises to offer if Naruto is willing to pick the team's dinner bill. Naruto dispels himself, much to Shikamaru's surprise, revealing himself to have been nothing more than a shadow clone. Shikamaru adds that Asuma was cruel for passing on the bill to Naruto, due to Chōji Akimichi's appetite.\\n\\nIn Tsunade's office, Shizune notifies Tsunade regarding an assault on a neighbouring village in the Land of Fire, which she believes to be the work of Amegakure. Tsuande is infuriated that one of the allied nations would risk starting a war by attacking another nation and asks for Asuma's team. Shizune brings up her concern over keeping Naruto in the village in the event that it was the Akatsuki, and Tsunade decides to send him out on a D-ranked mission regarding grave robbers. Meanwhile, The Naruto shadow clone returns to the clearing and shares the advice with the other Naruto's, unaware that Sai is watching him and drawing his likeness. Naruto manages to use Asuma's advice to grind his chakra against one another, and him and his shadow clones manage to tear their leaves in two. Feeling elated at his success, Naruto dispels the clones to acquire their experience, although the combined fatigue causes him to pass out. Kakashi catches the unconscious Naruto, and Sai, along with Sakura, who had joined at the last moment, come rushing out. After asking if Naruto is alright, Sakura notifies Kakashi that the team is wanted by Tsunade.\\n\\nAt the Yamanaka flower shop, Asuma buys a bouquet of flowers, although he doesn't reveal to whom. Ino tells him to say hi to Kurenai for her, causing Asuma to go red and wonder how she found out. Shikamaru and Chōji also see Asuma step out of the store with flowers and they tell him to wish Kurenai well. Asuma asks how they know, and Shikamaru tells him that despite his efforts to hide their relationship, everybody is already aware of it. Chōji prods Shikamaru to move on to more pressing matters, and Shikamaru notifies Asuma and Ino that the entire team is being tasked to go out on a mission by Tsunade.\\n\\nTeam Asuma arrives at Tsunade's office, where the Hokage debriefs them on their mission and notifies the team that the Akatsuki may be involved. She tells them all to take great care, and dismisses them. On a rooftop, Asuma stares longingly at Kurenai, who is in her room, but decides against approaching her and instead prepares to set off with his team. They notice Naruto, Sakura, Sai and Yamato heading off on a mission as a well, with Naruto being irritated that his training was interrupted for a mission. Konohamaru and the rest of Team Ebisu pass by, having caught another cat as per their mission. He wishes Naruto and Uncle Asuma well on their mission, prompting to Naruto to wonder why Konohamaru referred to Asuma as his uncle. Shikamaru notifies him that Asuma is the Third Hokage's son and hence Konohamaru's actual uncle. Naruto is surprised to learn of this, as are Ino and Chōji. Asuma dismisses his parentage as no big deal, but Naruto tells him that he feels like he has a special bond with Asuma since they share the same chakra nature type, and that the bond is strengthened by the fact that Asuma is the son of the Third Hokage. As Team Yamato begin to depart on their mission, Asuma reminds Naruto of his advice and asks Yamato to protect Naruto.\\n\\nBack in Tsunade's office, Kakashi reports on Naruto's training methods and is given a separate mission by the Hokage.

He tells them that a shinobi's corpse holds a wealth of information that would be considered a gold mine by interested parties.\\n\\nThe next morning, Naruto notices leaves flying in the wind and decides to stop and practise his training. As he is hunched over, Sai notices Naruto trembling and believes that Naruto is still scared by Yamato's story the other night, when Yamato had stated that the graves could have been disturbed by the very ninja who rested in them, having returned back to life. Naruto succeeds in tearing his leaf into a perfect half, and is ecstatic about his progress. When they reach their meeting point, Yamato is unable to locate any of the monks from the Fire Temple who were supposed to meet them there. Yamato and Sakura head off to locate them while Sai and Naruto are told to wait in case any of the monks arrive. When an owl in a tree frightens Naruto, Sai consults one of his books, which states that if a friend is frightened, they should show some tenderness by putting their arm around them. Sai gets up and sits next to Naruto, and proceeds to pull him into a one-armed hug, disturbing Naruto. Sai notices Naruto's perturbed facial reaction and attempts to use his other hand as well, leaning in for a hug. Naruto breaks free and berates Sai for his actions, claiming he does not like Sai like that.

After entering the tomb, he notices that the coffin is gone. His sojourn in the tomb is interrupted by Sora, a monk-in-training. Each of them believes the other to be a grave robber, and the two engage in a fight, nearly destroying the tomb.

This further\\'s Naruto\\'s irritation towards Sora, but stops when he notices all the glares the other monks give Sora, which seems familiar to him. In the Fire Temple, monk Chiriku explains that the men whose graves were robbed were all fallen members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, shinobi who were sworn to protect the Land of Fire\\'s daimyō. Naruto is confused over the existence of the Guardian Ninja, wondering why they would be required to protect the Land of Fire if the shinobi of Konohagakure, a village located in the Land of Fire, are also sworn to protect it. Yamato explains that the shinobi of Konoha protect the nation as a whole with the Guardian Ninja are tasked with protecting only the daimyō, the feudal lord who is the head of the Land of Fire. He also reveals that Asuma was once one of the twelve guardians.\\n\\nNaruto and Sakura are impressed, and Chiriku hopes Asuma is still well. Chiriku divulges more about the Guardians, explaining that once long ago, all twelve were assigned to protect the daimyō; however, six of them wished to have all the neighbouring lands under the Fire Daimyō\\'s control in the Land of Fire and attempted to invade them. Once the daimyō had caught wind of their plans, he had ordered the other six to eliminate the conspiratorial half, in which a battle ensued, leaving only Asuma and Chiriku as the survivors. Sai realises that this means that the men whose tombs were defiled and whose bodies were taken were friends and comrades of Asuma and Chiriku, thus making the issue personal for them. Sai drives his point home when he compares it to what Naruto and Sakura must feel if the same ever happened to Sasuke. Naruto gives Chiriku his word that they will apprehend the grave robbers once and for all.\\n\\nOutside the temple, the team witnesses the monks sparring, and Naruto notices that Sora is holding back. Entering the sparring match himself, Naruto and Sora begin exchanging blows, although Sora\\'s attacks are much more forceful. Sora tells Naruto that he would bestow a new name upon the genin for the afterlife, but after noticing all the other monks staring at him, Sora becomes enraged and his attacks lose focus, allowing Naruto to easily dodge all of them; Naruto manages to land a kick in Sora\\'s face as Chiriku ends the match. As Sora storms off, under the glare of the other monks, Naruto retreats to treat his bruise; Sai attempts to wipe his brow, an idea he picked up from his book. After Naruto asks him what Sora meant by bestowing a name for the afterlife, he interprets it as a friendly nickname and heads off to find Sora. \\n\\nHe finds Sora practising his Beast Tearing Gale Palm technique, cracking boulders and nearly collapsing the cave. Naruto inquires him over his usage of Wind Release, and Sora retaliates by attempting to hit Naruto; Naruto easily avoids and blocks all of Sora\\'s moves. Sora asks whether Naruto was always this annoying, and Naruto responds that people always thought so; he also deduces, based on the glares Sora gets, that Sora must also feel the same. Sora admits that nobody likes him, but that out of everyone, he dislikes himself the most. He blames it on a hidden power he possesses inside of him, one that he believes he cannot get rid of but needs in order to avenge his father\\'s murder. Before he can continue on any further, he notices a patrol bird from one of the hidden tombs and he, along with Naruto, return to the temple. There, Chiriku notifies them that another tomb has been broken into, and Team Yamato, along with Sora, head towards another tomb to prevent the next attack. After they leave, the grave robbers arrive at the Fire Temple.\\n'},\n",

She ponders over the latest string of events - the grave robberies of three of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, the Akatsuki's plans, Orochimaru supposedly returning to hiding following his encounter against Team Yamato and finally, Danzō Shimura himself, a village elder who is attempting to overthrow the current regime. Wanting to deal with the internal affairs first, Tsunade has Shizune dispatch Anbu members not affiliated with Root to observe Danzō at all times. At home, Danzō muses over Sai's request to stay on Team Kakashi, but before he can give it anymore thought, he senses the presence of the Anbu. Wondering what Tsunade is up to, he tells himself not to worry as he holds all the cards in his favour.\\n\\nIn the woods near the Fire Temple, Chiriku tells Yamato that the coffins must be heavy and that the only escape route is to the south. When they reach a valley, they notice the four coffins moving through the ground. Fearing it may be a trap, Yamato tells Chiriku to stay behind while the rest apprehend the coffins. Pairing Sai with Sakura and Sora with Naruto, the five pursue the coffins. As Naruto and Sora fight amongst each other to lead the mission, the coffins begin to go underground. Elsewhere, Furido, the man behind the operation, orders his four-man team to deal with the ones following the coffins. Using her scroll as a medium for her terrain-altering technique, Fuen draws out a new terrain filled with traps. Her terrain design is brought to life by Fudō, using his Earth Release: Mutability technique. As Team Yamato and Sora were confined within a maze riddled with traps, they were then each separated. Sakura and Sora went off to look for Naruto, who had nearly avoided being crushed by a rolling boulder. He is then faced by Fūka, who blames the trap evasion as a mistake on Fuen's part. Yamato uses his Wood Release to avoid being buried alive, but finds himself face-to-face with Fudō, the latter being impressed over his Wood Release ability. Coating himself with Rock Armour, he attempts to use his Chakra Enhanced Strength to kill Yamato, who manages to avoid the strike. Meanwhile, Sai is riding his giant ink bird in an effort to escape the maze, only to be stopped by Fuen, who manages to place a tracking device on Sai.\\n\"},\n",

Elsewhere in the village, Danzō Shimura is aware of the Anbu observing him at all times, placed under supervision by Tsunade herself.\\n\\nNear the Fire Temple, Fudō, with his Rock Armour, is seemingly invincible, avoiding all of Yamato's Wood Release and kunai equipped with explosive tags. Using his Earth Release: Bedrock Coffin technique, he seemingly entombs Yamato. Commending Yamato's worthiness, Fudō brands the coffin with the insignia of Konoha before departing, unaware that Yamato used his Earth Release to merge with the coffin. Yamato escapes, and theorises whether the ambush was just to attack one of them, wondering if Danzō may have been behind it. \\n\\nSai, who is engaged by Fuen, refuses to fight on a terrain designed by an enemy and flees using his Ink Mist Technique. Unaware that Fuen had thrown a tracking device on his backpack, his attempts to navigate the maze is halted by Fuen's Altering Terrain Diagram Scroll, which notifies her of his exact presence. Using her Altering Terrain Technique, she plants traps that nearly kill him. Not wanting to toy with her prey for too long, she decides to finish him off with Earth Release: Rock Section Cane, forming spears made of stone. She uses one of these spears to impale Sai, but using an ink-variant of the Body Replacement Technique, he reappears behind her, leaving his tracking chip behind. Using his Super Beast Imitating Drawing, he creates three ink beasts to go after her. While she easily defeats them with her stone spears, Sai uses the opportunity to disappear.\\n\\nNaruto is approached by Fūka, who offers to kiss him in either the French or traditional way. Naruto refuses to kiss what he deems an easy girl; when asked whether he had been kissed before, Naruto vehemently protests that he had, although he admits that it was to a guy, recalling his first and only kiss to none other than Sasuke. Fūka licks Naruto's cheek, and after tasting his wind type chakra, which she deems rare, wishes to add it to her collection. She kisses Naruto in an attempt to drain his chakra, but the latter dispels himself, revealing himself to be nothing more than a shadow clone. He creates more shadow clones and praises Fūka's soft lips, although he adds that she won't be able to kiss him again. Using Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, she burns and dispels of all his shadow clones. When he creates more, she resorts to using Water Release: Snake's Mouth technique to twist and swallow them all up, dispelling all of the clones. With no more clones left, Naruto is left exposed, dragged through the water's current as he marvels at Fūka's possession of two types of elemental chakra natures. Fūka responds in kind by using Lightning Release: Electromagnetic Murder to send a powerful jolt of electricity through the water. Before he is shocked, he expresses shock at her ability to possess not one or two but three different types of chakra natures.\\n\\nFudō and Fuen meet up at the top of the terrain, where Fudō proudly exclaims that he killed his foe. Fuen admits that she did not manage to do the same, but chalks it up to Sai being much more of a challenge than she anticipated. Inside the maze, Sakura, who was abandoned by Sora, is nearly attacked by a giant spider until she is saved by Sai, who uses his ink to blind the spider; the spider retaliates by shooting outs its venom, poisoning Sai. Sai asks Sakura if she touched by his move; pulling out a book on self-sacrifice, he reads out an excerpt that states that one of the best ways to touch other people is to give up your life for them, and that it works especially well with women. Sakura is irked by the comment, while Sai wonders whether the move would work on swaying Naruto. Sakura then jabs Sai with a needle containing antidote, as Sai shrieks in pain. Meanwhile, Sora manages to catch up to the mastermind orchestrating the attacks, Furido, who tells Sora that he has been waiting for him.\\n\"},\n",

However, after smelling the soil of the hidden tombs in the breeze, he discovers that Furido is one of the grave robbers and attempts to attack, although he is easily overpowered by Furido. Using a Five Elements Unseal, he unlocks Sora's true power, causing Sora's bandaged right arm to transform into a monstrous limb. Sora attempts to defeat Furido using an enhanced version of his Beast Tearing Gale Palm, but the attack is blocked by Furido's wind twister.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Fūka attempts to kiss Naruto once more, although he proves to be nothing more than a shadow clone. The real Naruto attempts to hit her from behind with Rasengan, but she counters the attack with her scattering flower technique, which causes a cyclone of flowers powered by wind type chakra to hit Naruto and dispel his Rasengan. Naruto is surprised to discover that she is able to use all five of the elemental chakra types. She tells Naruto that he is still a boy, unaware of the mysterious of women, and attempts to hit him with Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, Water Release: Snake's Mouth and Lightning Release: Electromagnetic Murder. Naruto avoids all her attacks, and Fūka resorts to using another one of her wind techniques - Spiralling Wind Ball. Naruto barely manages to avoid her attacks, and Fūka uses the opportunity to corner Naruto and use her scattering flower cyclone technique once more. Naruto creates a chain of shadow clones and has the last one cut off Fūka's hair with a kunai. Angered that Naruto damaged what Fūka perceives as the most important part of a woman, she freezes him in place with paralysis and performs her Execution by Kiss technique.\\n\\nSakura and Sai are on their way to find Naruto and Sora, but the latter is forced to stop due to the poison in his system. He tells Sakura that he is showing weakness, which he read in a book would further bonds. Sakura is irritated by his constant reading of books and tells him that certain things are to be experienced first hand. She and Sai then continue their pursuit and locate Naruto; Sakura is angered to see Naruto engaged in a kiss, exclaiming that it isn't the time for him to do such a thing, but Sai tells her something's not right. Sakura tries to attack Fūka, but she was counter-attacked by the latter and was caught by Yamato, who also searches for them. Before Yamato can break Fūka's technique, Fudō and Fuen arrive, and the former uses his Rock Pillar Prison Technique to trap the three, preventing them from interfering.\\n\\nOutside, Furido explains to Sora that the four corpses he stole would be used for the welfare of the Land of Fire, and prompts him to use his power to do the same. In order to sway him, Furido reveals that he held Sora once as a baby and that he also knew Sora's father. Before Sora can delve into the matter, he is wracked by a vision of Naruto in pain and an image of the Nine-Tails. Believing his psychic mental connection to be Naruto's cry for help, Sora leaves Furido to find Naruto. Back in the cave, Fūka continues to siphon Naruto's chakra; however, she ends up ingesting some of the Nine-Tails' malevolent chakra, the taste of the tailed beast's chakra breaking the technique. As the three grave robbers prepare to take Naruto out, he is backed up by Sora, who arrives to give Naruto a hand. Before they can engage in combat, the cave's roof is blasted open by Chiriku and the rest of the monks, who offer their assistance.

Tsunade theorises that the massacres might be a false flag attack meant to incite a war or a response from the Fire Daimyō himself; she then tells Team Asuma to remain on standby for further instructions. Shizune recalls that Asuma was one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja tasked to protect the daimyō. As Asuma leaves, Yamato enters, ready to give his mission report. Yamato notifies Tsunade that the defiled tombs contained the corpses of four of the Guardian Ninja, and Shizune believes that the techniques those ninja possessed may be confined within their corpses. Yamato also reports that due to Sai's injuries, he has taken Sora from the Fire Temple as his replacement. He also adds that Chiriku, a head monk, was not the target of their attacks, leaving Naruto or Sora as their intended target.\\n\\nOutside, Asuma sees Team Yamato, and seems to recognises Sora. Sakura and Naruto berate Sora for his rudeness towards Asuma and warn him not to do the same to Tsunade. However, mere seconds after they enter her office, Tsunade kicks Sora out of her office, destroying the door and the wall, attempting to pummel him for insulting her; Asuma mentally remarks that it has been a long while since he had seen Sora. As they exit her office, Sakura takes Sai to the hospital, telling Naruto to stick with Sora. Sora, however, rebuffs his companionship, stating that he would take over the village in no time. Naruto heeds his words moments too late, and attempts to find and stop him. By the time he does, he finds Sora locked into a staredown with Akamaru, the latter having barked at Sora suspiciously. Naruto sighs in relief that Kiba himself is not there, only for Kiba to appear. Sora asks Kiba to keep Akamaru on a leash and to teach him to not bark at strangers. The insinuation that Akamaru is a pet angers Kiba, and the pair get into a scuffle. Chōji and Shikamaru arrive, with Chōji telling the two to get along. However, after Sora calls him fat, Chōji enters the battle himself. \\n\\nDue to the fact that Sora is a member of their team, Naruto does not feel right leaving Sora to fight two opponents at once and attempts to back Sora up. Sora does not want Naruto involved, but is slightly touched when Naruto says that he is doing so only because he sees Sora as his comrade. Rock Lee, who witnesses the fisticuffs between the four, views it as a bout of friendship and inserts himself in the fight as well. Shikamaru sighs in disbelief as he witnesses the scene, and tells Asuma, who had just arrived, that he was not into such childish things. Sora unleashes his Beast Tearing Palm while Kiba transforms Akamaru into his Beast Human Clone while he himself uses his Four Legs Technique; Lee prepares his Leaf Great Whirlwind while Naruto uses Shadow Clone Technique, followed by Chōji, who jumps into the air and uses his Multi-Size Technique. Wanting to end the fight, Asuma stops their attacks with his mere hands while Shikamaru freezes them in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique; however, Chōji, who was mid-air, is unaffected by it and ends up hitting Shikamaru in the face. Asuma then tells the team to go have some barbecue after their bout. Sora attempts to refuse the invitation by claiming that he is not hungry, but his grumbling stomach betrays him.\\n\\nAt Yakiniku Q, Sora attempts to ask Asuma if he knew Kazuma, his father. Asuma attempts to steer the conversation in another way, and Naruto takes the opportunity to ask Asuma to teach Sora his technique, since all three of them possess Wind Release. In the woods, Asuma unveils his chakra blades and, infusing his chakra with his wind nature, has his blades go through a tree and strike the boulder behind it. Using their kunai, Naruto and Sora decide to attempt the same thing. Outside the village, Furido and his team decide to attack another village, one housing the Kohaku Clan, with Furido stating that their deaths would be a great sacrifice as it would benefit the Land of Fire as a whole.\\n\"},\n",

Naruto and Sora do not wish to waste time learning team formations when they would rather use their time to continue their Nature Transformation training. However, Naruto asks Yamato regarding the five elements and asks whether it would be possible for him to learn a secondary type, such as Water Release, by the time he became Jōnin. Yamato explains that one does not learn new chakra types, but must be born with the affinity to use it; however, their dominant affinity would make the other types significantly weaker. Naruto asks how one who possesses all five would be able to use them successfully, to which Yamato tells them that there has never been a shinobi who has possessed all five. This leaves Naruto to muse how Fūka was able to do so, but his thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. Interrupting their session, he reminds Yamato that Sora would not remain a member of Team Kakashi for long, and therefore learning team formations would be useless. On top of that, neither Naruto nor Sora would actually take the time to learn and utilise the formation, as they both possess strong techniques and would rather enter a battle headfirst, and instead advises Sakura and Yamato to back them up. With that in mind, Yamato calls off their formation training session, although he reminds Naruto and Sora that Asuma is on standby and thus is free to take over their nature transformation training, much to the latter's chagrin.\\n\\nin Tsunade's office, she alerts Yamato to a message she had received from Chiriku, notifying them about a secret regarding Sora. About a decade ago, Sora had unleashed some mysterious power that nearly destroyed the Fire Temple, wounding many monks. While he was subjected to medical tests, the cause of his true power was undetected and the temple kept the boy under constant surveillance. However, Sora never had another episode. Despite that, those who witnessed the attack despises Sora, hence Sora's feelings of the Fire Temple not being his true home. Chiriku had found the matter important to share with Tsunade, and Yamato remarks on the further coincidences that both Sora and Naruto share.\\n\\nIn the woods, Asuma watches over Naruto and Sora attempting to master their Wind Release ability. After a few hours, he tells the two that they should continue their training tomorrow as it is getting late, but the two believe that Asuma would be training them again the next day and rejoice. The next day, Naruto and Sora continue using their kunai to destroy a tree. Asuma is surprised that the two are able to create their current level of damage without using chakra blades, further demonstrating the pair's strength. Asuma performs the same technique with a kunai; it punctures the tree but does not create a hole around it. He tells the two to concentrate on their wind chakra instead of distracting themselves with the idea of destroying the tree. As he marvels on the duo's stamina levels, he notices Sora's backpack. He then calls for a lunch break and treats the two at Ramen Ichiraku. As Naruto rushes off after lunch to resume training, Asuma pulls Sora aside and presents the latter's Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw, which Asuma had reforged with the same metal as his trench knives. Sora does not thank Asuma and runs out after Asuma claims he does not have time to oversee their training any longer. Asuma recalls how it was he who killed Sora's father, Kazuma, after Kazuma decided to murder the Hokage in an attempt to bring all of the neighbouring lands under the control of the Fire Daimyō. His thoughts are interrupted by Kurenai, who is able to tell that there is something bothering him due to the recent increase in his smoking habits, suggesting that he should quit.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tsunade is notified that Danzō Shimura has somehow escaped, managing to slip away from the Anbu sent to keep him under watch. Strolling through the village, Sora sees a father and son, who after buying food, reminds his son to thank him. Sora recalls Asuma repairing his claws and the fact that he did not thank Asuma. Naruto locates Sora from a bridge, but he is not the only one who has found Sora; Furido, the mastermind behind the grave robberies, has managed to track Sora to Konohagakure. He ambushes Sora when the monk-in-training is alone, and reminds him to use his hidden power for the greater good of the Land of Fire. Giving Sora two king pieces from a shōgi set, he reveals to Sora that it was Asuma who had killed his father.\\n\\nFollowing this reveal, Sora retreats to the woods, where he is joined by Naruto. Rejecting Naruto's attempts at conversation, Sora channels his anger into his chakra and throws his kunai at a tree, causing the kunai to go through it and shatter the boulder behind it.\\n\"},\n",

Both of them are chained and brought back to Konohagakure in order to be interrogated by Tsunade. At the Konoha Hospital, Naruto visits Sai, reading his books while Sai repeats Sakura's advice about gaining real-life experiences. Looking out the window, Sai is stunned when he spots Danzō being detained and brought into the village. As Danzō and the spy, Tatsuji, are brought into a secret meeting place, Tsunade summons Asuma and Yamato to the meeting as well. Sora, who was tailing Asuma, follows him to the meeting and hides in the rafters.\\n\\nTsunade asks Danzō to explain himself, asking why he would meet with an Ame-nin when tensions are so high after Amegakure was suspected of being responsible for attacking numerous villages. Danzō states that Tsunade is incompetent as Hokage if she did not even know that Amegakure were not the culprits. Yamato reveals that he recognises Tatsuji as a member of the Anbu that went missing on a mission years ago. Tsunade moves on to Tatsuji, bringing in Ibiki Morino to torture him until he gave up information. However, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, the village elders and members of the Konoha Council, state that Tatsuji was a spy sent by Danzō into Amegakure and that he was not only reporting information back to him, but to them as well. In an attempt to make Tsunade look inept, Danzō takes the opportunity to discuss the grave robberies near the Fire Temple and how Tsunade welcomed Sora to the village with open arms, despite Sora possessing a dangerous power that nearly destroyed the temple. When Koharu states that Sora should be kept under lock and key, Danzō states the best thing to do would be to eliminate him, unaware that Sora himself is eavesdropping from the rafters. However, Yūgao Uzuki and another Anbu member locate him and bring him down to Tsunade's attention.\\n\\nSora vehemently protests against his capture, blaming Tsunade and Konoha for wanting to kill him due to the power he possesses within him and citing his own fault for trusting Yamato, his team, and the village itself. He then asks Asuma if he had killed Kazuma, and Asuma bluntly reveals that he did. Manifesting his chakra and transforming his right hand into a monstrous limb, Sora knocks out the Anbu members holding him and attempts to attack Asuma, who blocks the former's Beast Tearing Gale Palm with his chakra blades. Their bout destroys the wall, and the fight continues outside. The destruction of the wall sends a plume of smoke into the sky, which Naruto notices. Asuma manages to kick Sora into a wall, but when Sora attempts to get back up and attack again, his arm transforms back into normal. An Anbu member decides to take the opportunity to kill Sora with shuriken, but Naruto leaps in front of its path. When Sora blames Naruto for butting in, Naruto recalls Sora having his back in the cave, and repeats Sora's words. Asuma notices that the Anbu member who tried to kill Sora is from Root, but before anybody is able to interfere, Sora is whisked away by Furido. Naruto then faints from having shuriken embedded in his back.\\n\\nIn the hospital, Naruto has a nightmare about the monks of the Fire Temple attempting to seal a tailed beast's chakra, although to no avail. As the jinchūriki in his dream destroys the Iron Walls of the temple, he seems a glimpse of the Nine-Tailed Fox; Naruto then wakes up. Meanwhile, Shikamaru, Chōji and Kiba are tasked with locating Sora. On the outskirts of the village, Furido explains to Sora that the Land of Fire could not have two great kings, equal with power; hence, Kazuma, Sora's father, attempted to unite both great kings, the Fire Daimyō and Konoha's Hokage. However, his plan was failed by Asuma, who stood with his Hokage. Furido explains that Kazuma's ultimate goal was for the welfare of the Land of Fire, and that it was he who bestowed Sora's power to him. He asks Sora to help him fulfil Kazuma's wish, and in doing so, he would grant Sora as many opportunities as possible for settling the score with Asuma.\\n\\nDischarged from the hospital, Naruto goes on a walk with Sakura, with the latter expressing her marvel over Naruto's healing abilities. As the two split up, Naruto senses Sora's negative emotions and malevolent chakra. He senses Sora near Tsunade's office, and heads in that direction. In her office, Tsunade puts down a pen and prepares to sit back and relax as a projectile is headed her way. Before she can be killed, Naruto barges into her office and tackles her, saving her life. Sora jumps in through the window and attempts to use his monstrous arm to finish the job, but is impeded by Naruto. As Shizune and two Anbu members enter the room, Sora flees through the open window with Naruto in pursuit.\\n\"},\n",

Standing above the fallen Fuen, Sakura builds up chakra into her fist and strikes her in the abdomen, killing her. As Fuen cast the Barrier Gate Five Seals Technique: Castle Closing Eight Gates, her death causes the barriers around Konoha to recede. \\n\\nIn Tsunade\\'s office, Shikamaru tells her that he cannot come up with a countermeasure without being on the front lines. Coming across Ino, the pair head to the main gates, where they overhear Chōji telling the others that whoever defeated the barrier caster had done their job, and now it was time to do theirs. After asking everyone if they had enough chakra, Shikamaru formulates a strategy to defeat the reanimated corpses quickly.\\n\\nBack at the power station, Kitane traps Asuma with his Lightning Release: Thunder Binding in order to prevent Asuma\\'s interference without killing him. Asuma is unable to get out of the lightning trap due to the electricity that flows through the walls. In another part of the village, Yamato is avoiding being struck by Fudō. Using his Rock Armour, Fudō tries to strike Yamato, only for Yamato to keep evading. Yamato uses his Earth Release: Earth Flow Spears to create spikes to skewer Fudō, but the latter merely punches them away. Using Fudō to soften the terrain, Yamato then uses his Water Release: Tearing Torrent to create a powerful current of water that causes the soft ground beneath Fudō to swallow him up. As he struggles to get free, Yamato uses his Wood Release: Tree Bind Flourishing Burial to constrict and squeeze Fudō to death.\\n\\nAt the main gate, Shikamaru has Chōji use his Multi-Size Technique followed by his Human Bullet Tank technique to roll over and destroy some of the reanimated corpses. He then has Lee use his taijutsu to create a powerful whirlwind that sucks in the corpses, and prepares to have Kiba and Akamaru use their Fang Passing Fang to take out the rest. However, to their surprise, the corpses all turn into dust, as Fudō, their caster, had just been killed.\\n\\nOn the outskirts of the village, Furido tells Sora that everyone in Konoha must die as they are all loyal to their king, the Hokage. Sora puts his Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw against Furido\\'s throat in an attempt to protect the village, but Furido dodges the move and uses his cane to pull Sora down to ground level. Berating Sora for showing weakness towards Konoha for showing him compassion, he proceeds to beat Sora with his cane.\\n'},\n",

However, by using her Colour Course Change technique, she seemingly regenerates her wounds. Using her Lightning Release: Lightning Rod, she shocks him as she prepares to finish him off. However, she is hit by two Naruto shadow clones performing Rasengan. The impact of the Rasengan seemingly destroys her body, but a withered Fūka survives. Using her Colour Course Change ability once more, she seems to regenerate her body back to her youthful state. Naruto throws a kunai at her, which she dodges easily; however, a shadow clone behind her throws his kunai as well, which slices her hair. Entering into an angered state, she dispels the shadow clone with her Earth Release: Rock Pillar Spears technique and attempts to finish the real Naruto off with her Water Release: Stormy Blockade, which summons a massive amount of water. \\n\\nThe water dispels all of the other Naruto shadow clones, leaving only the real one. Naruto jumps out of the way to escape her Lightning Release techniques, but is confused when she retaliates with her Earth Release: Mud Spore to create a mudslide once more. He correctly deduces that the reason she is using Earth Release now as opposed to Lightning is because she must be using different bodies, each body having a different chakra affinity. After he had cut her, she had switched to another body that possessed Earth instead of Lightning, explaining the difference in technique and the \"healing\" of her wounds. Surprised at his deduction, she claims that his knowledge won\\'t do him much now and that she must kill him, as she cannot let him live to reveal her secret. As she kisses him in order to steal his Wind Release chakra as well as his body, Naruto reflects on how she does not seem to care about the damage to her bodies as she does about her hair. Figuring out her weakness, he grabs her hair and rips off a chunk. Infuriated, she attempts to bind him with her hair, but remembering his wind chakra leaf training, he uses his mere palms to tear her hair off her body. As her body withers away, leaving just a mop of hair floating above, the latter encasing her soul, Fūka rushes towards Naruto; the genin counters by creating a shadow clone and hitting the soul-contained hair with his Rasengan, destroying the soul housed within and killing Fūka.\\n\\nMeanwhile at the power station, Asuma uses his chakra blades to use his Wind Release: Verdant Mountain Gale to slice through the Lightning Release: Thunder Binding that was holding him prisoner. He manages to track down Kitane and fatally wound him before the latter could perform his Limelight ability. On the outskirts of the village, Furido tells Sora the tale of the Nine-Tailed Fox and its attack on Konoha nearly 15 years ago, and how the Fourth Hokage sealed the fox\\'s spirit in a baby to give Konoha its jinchūriki. He reveals that some of the demon fox\\'s chakra was harnessed by a third party and after five years sealed into a young child, none other than Sora, thus making Sora a pseudo-jinchūriki. As Furido notices that Kitane has died, he ends the jutsu on the other three, killing them off once more. He then uses his Five Elements Unseal to release the remnants of the fox spirit within Sora. Naruto, who had formed a brief mental connection with Sora earlier, heads in his direction and is shocked to see the fox\\'s chakra above the treetops. Asuma, who had theorised that Sora would be used in an attack, also heads towards the same direction.\\n'},\n",

Asuma realises that Furido is none other than Sora's father, Kazuma, whom he thought he had killed years ago. Kazuma explains to Naruto that some of the Nine-Tails' leaked chakra was sealed and suppressed inside of Sora, but now that the seal had been removed, the fox's chakra was taking over Sora's body, all part of Kazuma's plan to sic a miniature Nine-tails' on Konoha. Sakura and Yamato arrive as well, surprised to see Sora possessing the Nine-Tails' Cloak. As Asuma and Kazuma begin their bout, Naruto attempts to sympathise with Sora, who uses his roar towards Sakura. Naruto protects Sakura, telling Sora that he had once used the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox to hurt Sakura and that he wouldn't allow the same to happen again. Using his Wood Release, Yamato binds Sora, although he is unable to suppress his chakra due to Sora not possessing the First Hokage's Necklace. Sora enters into his one-tailed form, but Team Asuma arrives at the nick of time, with Shikamaru using his Shadow Imitation Technique to trap Sora in place. He has Chōji use his Partial Multi-Size Technique to grab a hold onto Sora. Naruto tells Sora that he cannot allow Sora to use their power for evil. When Sora asks what he means, Naruto explains that he is the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox.\\n\\nSora does not believe him, as he claims those with tailed beast spirits within them are meant to be outcasts for life, and questions how Naruto could have friends. Naruto explains that when he was younger he was just like Sora, receiving the hateful, angry glares from adults; however, he had always pulled stunts for attention to distract himself from his loneliness and in the process ended up making friends. When Sora cries that he never had any friends, Naruto tells him that he and the others are his friends. Ino uses her Mind Body Switch Technique on Sora, but Sora gives in to the fox spirit within him, causing Ino pain and dispelling her. The burning sensation caused by the fox's chakra burns Chōji's arms, and Shikamaru's chakra runs out, freeing Sora. Sora then succumbs to his rage and enters into his three-tailed form.\\n\"},\n",

However, Kazuma is stealthily bound by three ink snakes, created by Sai, who had left the hospital when he heard the commotion in the village. Kazuma breaks out of Sai's binds and attempts to rush at Asuma, but Asuma stabs him with his chakra blades. As Kazuma dies, Asuma spots his white Land of Fire sash, recalling Sora's words about how the only thing he could remember about his father was his spotless white sash.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Naruto attempts to get through to Sora, who keeps attacking him. Sakura attempts to jump in and heal him, but Sora fires a Tailed Beast Ball. While Yamato protects himself, Team Asuma, Kiba, Akamaru and Rock Lee with his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall, Naruto shields Sakura's body with his own. He tells Sakura to standby until he can save Sora from the Nine-Tailed Fox's spirit, and asks Sakura to heal him first. However, Sora's body is not strong enough to contain the fox's chakra and rejects it. As the chakra is expelled from Sora's body, it takes on the monstrous shape of a fox's head; however, without a host body to take over, the chakra dissipates. Sora is restored to his human self, although he is unconscious. Naruto attempts to wake him up, and Sora manages to hear Naruto and recalls their interactions. As Sora wakes up, Naruto proclaims that Sora could now go home. Sora tells him that he has no home, and Naruto tells him that Konoha is his new home, filled with his new friends.

Hiruzen had berated him for still not understanding what or who the king truly was, and at his grave, Asuma tells his father that he finally understands. He leaves his lit cigarette at the grave and walks off. Meanwhile, in Tsunade's office, Shizune alerts the Hokage that Kakashi, who had been sent to find word on the Akatsuki as well as locate Jiraiya, has returned to Konoha and has compiled a report.\\n\\nIn the hospital, Sakura cuts some apples for Sai to eat, which the latter interprets as Sakura having a crush on him due to the book he is reading. Naruto, asleep in the next bed, dreams about Sakura feeding him. Sakura then jams an apple in his mouth, nearly causing Naruto to choke, as Kakashi walks in. Naruto prepares to leave the hospital so that they may train but Kakashi warns him that the next stage would be arduous that leaving the hospital without fully recovering would result in dire consequences. Asuma then shows up, asking for a private moment with Kakashi. As he leaves, he appoints Sakura in charge of the two boys.\\n\\nOutside, Asuma and Kakashi reminisce how Naruto's generation has grown to the point where they were able to successfully fend off an attack on the village. Kakashi muses that it won't be long before they leave the older shinobi in the dust, and Asuma counters that he still has some good years left in him. Before he can tell Kakashi what was on his mind, they are interrupted by the arrival of Kurenai; Asuma tells Kakashi that they shall discuss the matter later, which piques Kakashi's interest. Kakashi is later summoned to Tsunade's office, where she asks if Naruto is truly capable of learning and mastering a new technique. Kakashi tells her that he is not certain, but he believes that Naruto will most likely succeed.\\n\\nElsewhere, Yugito Nii, the Two-Tails jinchūriki, is confronted by Hidan and Kakuzu, two members of the Akatsuki sent to retrieve her.

Kakuzu states that as the one in charge of Akatsuki's finances, money is the most important thing in life, and claims that he only agreed to be Hidan's partner when he was told that religion could be profitable. As Zetsu leaves with Yugito, Hidan and Kakuzu set off towards the Land of Fire to find themselves another jinchūriki.\\n\\nBack in Konoha, Naruto is discharged from the hospital and is ready to resume his training. When Yamato and Kakashi ask him to review over what he learned so far, Naruto uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to create shadow clones and has them all perform the leaf cutting technique. However, he faints after he dispels all of them and gains their cumulative fatigue.\\n\\nKakuzu goes on a detour and brings Hidan to the Fire Temple while searching for the Land of Fire's jinchūriki. Using his Earth Release: Earth Spear, Kakuzu breaks down the Sealed Iron Wall of the temple. Inside, the monks alert Chiriku about the Akatsuki's invasion. Kakuzu recognises Chiriku as a monk who possesses the Gift of the Hermit Group's chakra and has a 30 million bounty on his head. Kakuzu and Hidan go for the attack, but Chiriku uses his Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder, the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple, to block and counter all of their attacks. As Chiriku promises them a funeral, Hidan is outraged at the idea of his funeral rites being presided over by another religion, and receives Kakuzu's blessing to kill Chiriku, although he stipulates that Chiriku be recognisable at the end in order to claim the bounty. The notion of killing humans for money is found despicable by Hidan, but he nonetheless charges at Chiriku with his Triple-Bladed Scythe.\\n\\nAs Naruto wakes up, Kakashi explains that the next stage would be to complete his nature transformation by converting his chakra into wind and stopping the flow of a waterfall. Yamato uses his Wood Release to fashion a bridge; using his shadow clones, Naruto stands on the bridge and attempts to slice the flow of the waterfall, recalling Asuma's advice. Unbeknownst to him, both Sai and Sakura are witnessing his training from the woods.\\n\\nAt the Fire Temple, Hidan is finishing his Jashin ritual, having killed Chiriku and nearly every other monk, save for Sentoki, who decides to report the massacre to Konoha.

Hidan takes his Retractable Spear out of his torso, grimacing in pain, as he follows Kakuzu.\\n\\nBack at the waterfall, Yamato is in place using his Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads to suppress the Nine-Tails' chakra, should it ever leak. Kakashi is lying on a wooden bench fashioned by Yamato, reading his Icha Icha book. Naruto asks for a shortcut, even asking to create more shadow clones, but Kakashi tells him that there isn't any more space left on the bridge to create shadow clones. Yamato tells Naruto that he has exceeded their expectations, as it would normally take one six months to master leaf cutting while he perfected it in mere hours. Kakashi adds that even Sasuke took a few days to undergo his nature transformation so he could convert his chakra into lightning in order to use Chidori. Naruto states that Sasuke is the very person he needs to catch up to; grabbing wind of Naruto's determination, Kakashi instructs Yamato to create two more waterfalls and extend the bridge, allowing Naruto to create more multiple shadow clones in order to accelerate his training.\\n\"},\n",

On the way to the woods, Sai asks whether Shikamaru was smart in pursuing Hidan alone, with his motives being personal.

However, Shikamaru manages to use his Shadow Gathering Technique to pull all the explosive tags he had set around the woods and bind them to Hidan.

Hidan wonders when Shikamaru had set such a trap and is shocked to find out that it has been created long before Team 10 ambushed them. Hidan reminds Shikamaru that he cannot die, but Shikamaru notifies him that the woods they are in belong to the Nara clan, and that only clan members can enter the area; on top of that, various deer around the area would always be watching him.

He explains that Naruto would be learning a Cooperation Ninjutsu, citing his Fire Release: Flame Bullet and Gamabunta's Toad Oil Bullet as an example, as both their moves combined creates the more powerful Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet technique. Naruto tells Jiraiya that he had done something similar to Yamato, when the captain had combined his Water Release: Tearing Torrent and Naruto's Wind Release: Rasengan to create the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique. Upon realising that Naruto has aided in a cooperation technique before, he claims that Naruto should be able to do the same with a toad, and proceeds to summon Gamariki, a flamboyant toad who dislikes Naruto. Naruto asks Jiraiya why he can't create a cooperation technique with him, and Jiraiya reminds him that he may not always be there, but that he can always summon toads. Jiraiya then demonstrates to Naruto of using a collaboration technique by sending his chakra into Gamariki to power up his Water Release: Water Gun. Naruto, impressed by this, is told by Jiraiya that his Wind Release should cause him to create an even more powerful version of that technique. However, he is stumped as both Naruto and Gamariki find themselves unable to work or get along with one another.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Orochimaru summons Sasuke to his chambers where he announces his desire to test Sasuke's strength, and remarks that he does not detect a flicker of fear from Sasuke. Sasuke confidently tells Orochimaru that he is ready to take him on.\\n\"},\n",

After placing some headgear on Yūkimaru's head, Kabuto gives Yūkimaru a pill that causes the latter to release chakra. The chakra begins to draw out a beast hiding underneath the lake, but Yūkimaru passes out due to exertion before the beast is summoned. Kabuto remarks that Yūkimaru is truly useful to Orochimaru and is content with having located the beast.\\n\\nIn the woods, Kakashi summons Pakkun. After placing one of the crystals in Pakkun's bandaged paw, he alerts Pakkun that the crystal has one of Shino's bugs encased inside and that it was caused by one of Orochimaru's followers, and asks the hound to bring the crystal to Konoha and relay the situation to Tsunade. Meanwhile, Guren leaves her subordinates at a deserted ruins and tells them to stay put as she heads off towards Orochimaru's hideout.\\n\\nNaruto is attempting to perfect his coordination with Gamariki but the friction between the pair causes the two of them to land in the hot spring where Jiraiya was soaking and attempting to peep at the women. The impact of their fall washes out the water, much to the sannin's dismay, as the women exit the springs. Jiraiya berates Gamariki and Naruto, and Naruto states that they are not compatible. He asks to use toads that he is compatible with, but Jiraiya tells him that while his idea is a good one, he is unable to summon with his right arm in a cast. Naruto, grinning, reminds Jiraiya that he has underestimated his healing ability and proceeds to break the cast off and use his summoning technique, calling on both Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, who have now grown much larger.\\n\\nOn the way to Orochimaru's hideout, Guren spots her master and Sasuke himself. She recalls when she rushed into his lair to give her body up for Orochimaru to use as his vessel, only for Kabuto to tell her that she was too late and that Orochimaru had chosen Gen'yūmaru, and that Sasuke was to be his next vessel. Angered at what Sasuke has that she does not, she follows the pair to the edge of the woods, where Orochimaru tells Sasuke that he is now going to prove his strength in a battle; however, his opponent is not Orochimaru, but thousands of armed shinobi. Nonetheless, Orochimaru detects no fear in Sasuke's eyes and Sasuke engages against his opponents with his sword in tow.\\n\\nOn the cliff top, Naruto is floored at Gamakichi and Gamatatsu's cooperation ninjutsu training, which seems to consist of dance moves and the toads leaping around eating flies. Meanwhile, Sasuke manages to defeat all of his foes without a fatal blow to them. Orochimaru reminds Sasuke that he must be heartless and kill his opponents, but Sasuke retorts that he will be heartless when he kills Itachi. Orochimaru marvels at the sight of Sasuke, as he defeated thousands of opponents without a single drop of blood, and remarks how he was considered a genius in his time but that his prowess does not compare to that of Sasuke's. As Sasuke walks out of the woods, he passes by Guren. The latter is approached by Orochimaru, who asks her whether it is still her dream to be his vessel. When she confirms it, he tells her that he has a special mission for her that only she can complete, and that if she succeeds, he may reconsider choosing her as his next vessel.\\n\\nOn their walk back to the hideout, Kabuto notices that Yūkimaru is exhausted and needs rest, and stops at a hot springs, which happens to be the same one Naruto and Jiraiya are at. In the springs, Naruto mentions out loud how the toads' training does not cause him to see what's truly in their hearts and souls. Yūkimaru shocks Naruto with his appearance and asks the genin if what he remarked out loud was true. Naruto reaffirms his comment, and tells Yūkimaru that home is where the person who is always on your mind is. As Yūkimaru praises Naruto for his wisdom, Naruto claims that he knows a lot of things; Yūkimaru then disappears, leaving a stunned Naruto to wonder where he went, noticing a single white flower left behind.\\n\\nIn a cave, Kiba is restless as the Orochimaru Search Team is resting. Shino reminds him that they must wait for his insects to locate the enemy and that they might as well rest while they have the chance. In the meantime, Pakkun reaches Konoha with the message from Kakashi, although he asks for some water first before relaying it. In the hot springs, Gamatatsu and Gamakichi use a shrinking technique to enter the water, although Gamatatsu undoes the technique, causing his weight and momentum to drain the water, chasing the women out once more. Jiraiya, hearing their cries, comes out to join the women but is devastated when he finds out that they have left.\\n\"},\n",

Jiraiya tells him that everyone he has met so far is aware of how strong he is training, and that the mystery is how he keeps it up. Naruto states that he doesn\\'t like to give up and the thought of what Sasuke would think drives him to continue his training; he then passes out on Jiraiya\\'s back. Jiraiya soon gets a message from a bird regarding the Akatsuki and immediately sets off, although not before asking the two toad brothers to continue to help with Naruto\\'s training and to escort him back to Konoha.\\n\\nBack in her office, Tsunade observes the crystal and gives it to Shizune to analyse, as per Kakashi\\'s instructions.

In the woods, Team 8 comes to a stop when Shino, Kiba and Akamaru are unable to pick up any enemy scents. With her Byakugan, Hinata relays that there are no enemies in their vicinity, picking up only the sight of a bat flying around. Shino senses one of his bugs and informs the group that his bug came into contact with the enemy and survived, and thus has an immunity against Crystal Release. He then plans to find that insect and selectively breed it to create a resistant army, while Kiba, Hinata and Kakashi continue to scout for their target. As they leave, they fail to notice the bat hanging upside down from a tree branch who promptly flies away.\\n\\nGuren\\'s team sits in a house, waiting for Guren herself to return. One of them, Rinji, plays a game of dice with the others and notices that Gozu is sitting by himself, unwilling to play. Rinji remarks how Gozu was strong enough to survive the massacre on his own while the others formed alliances and invites him to join their team as a full-fledged member. Rinji then sets out on patrol, where he sees the bat flying above. The bat lands on his arm and uses its ultrasonic mind waves to transmit what it has seen. Knowing that there are enemies out there, Rinji orders the bat to relay a message for him. He is then approached by Gozu, who wishes to go out on patrol with him. In the woods, Kiba hears the ultrasonic frequency and likens it to the sound of a dog whistle, but is confused as neither he nor Akamaru are able to pick up a dog\\'s scent.\\n\\nNaruto arrives back in the village, where he is approached by Konohamaru, who decides to show Naruto his new Sexy Technique. Realising that they are in a busy street with people looking at them, Naruto proceeds to hit Konohamaru on the head to prevent the technique. He buys a bowl of ramen for Konohamaru as an apology for hitting him and explains that there is a certain time and place for using the Sexy Technique. Naruto then summons Gamakichi and Gamatatsu to resume his training. Konohamaru is amazed at Naruto\\'s summons and Naruto nonchalantly tells Konohamaru that he usually summons a bigger toad but that these two \"little ones\" will do; Gamakichi reminds Naruto that he is his father\\'s henchman, and Naruto asks him to play it cool as he wishes to impress Konohamaru. However, Gamatatsu refuses to participate in the training unless he is given snacks, and Naruto gives Gama-chan, his purse, to Konohamaru and asks the latter to buy some snacks. After feeding the toad, Naruto asks him to use his Water Release: Water Gun technique, but is floored when he finds out that Gamatatsu cannot use Water Release. Irritated that he has trained with him for nothing, he asks Gamakichi to take his brother\\'s place, only for Gamakichi to tell Naruto that he too cannot use Water Release.\\n'},\n",

Guren is incensed at being forced to travel and take care of a child, but Kabuto reminds her that if she does not succeed in her mission, then she will not have a chance at being Orochimaru's new vessel.\\n\\nNaruto and Konohamaru are on a clifftop, with the former outraged at the toads' inability to use Water Release, recalling their father's Water Release: Gunshot technique. However, when the toads decide to ditch him and leave him to train with Gamariki, he decides he would rather train with the brothers and teach them how to use Water Release, which he starts off by having them drink water, much to Konohamaru's dismay.\\n\\nIn the deserted ruins, Team Guren awaits for their leader's return while Rinji notifies the other members that there is someone tracking them from the mountains, having picked up on the trail of a dog. He tells them that whomever is following them is most likely doing it to get to Orochimaru and thus they must either be the Akatsuki or shinobi from Konohagakure. Gozu asks why the team does not turn themselves in at Konoha, asking for amnesty in exchange for selling out Orochimaru. Rinji tells him the thought of it had not even crossed his mind, and that he would rather wait for Guren to return as his goal relies on the long run.\\n\\nIn the village, Tsunade summons Yamato and asks him to provide assistance to the Orochimaru Search Team, led by Kakashi, and tells him to take Sakura and Sai with him. Yamato inquires whether to bring Naruto as well, but Tsunade voices her strong opinion against it, telling him that Naruto is not to learn of the mission. Meanwhile, Yūkimaru and Guren set off on their walk, with the latter being irritated at their slow pace.

She recalls when she too was bedridden once and promptly awakens, only to discover that it is morning. She immediately notices that Yūkimaru is not in bed and rushes out, hearing the sound of an instrument. Following the sound, she finds the boy, who explains that the instrument belonged to his mother and that his family is no more, thus leaving him without a home.

As Team 8 prepares to move out as the rain is subsiding, Shino arrives and tells them that he has found the survivors but that their numbers are small. In order to selectively breed them to drastically increase their numbers, Shino tells the other members of the team to carry on without him.

Seeing the white camellia on the back of her outfit, he is reminded of his mother, who did not return. Scared that Guren will die, he gives up his good luck charm necklace to her, claiming that the crystallised camellia she bestowed to him is his new good luck charm. In the village, Naruto runs into Sai, who is buying new ink. Naruto deduces that Sai buying new ink must mean that he is being sent on a mission. Sai, under orders not to reveal the mission to Naruto, attempts to lie, but his endeavour is noticed by Naruto and only further revealed when Sai drops a book on how to lie; Sai then divulges his mission to Naruto. Enraged, Naruto heads to Tsunade's office and asks to join the Orochimaru Search Team, promising not to use Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. Shizune tells him that they kept him in the dark to protect him and that he is not strong enough to save Sasuke while Tsunade merely asks why he wishes to join the mission. Naruto tells her that he is aware that he is not strong enough to face Sasuke, but that Jiraiya had told him something about home being where people care about you. He tells her that he cares about Sasuke and thus Konoha is his home, and that he believes he can convince Sasuke to return. Tsunade relents, much to Shizune's dismay, and assigns Naruto the team, although she is unable to explain the particulars of the mission as Naruto runs out. When Shizune asks why she gave in to his request, the Hokage merely states that Jiraiya was right and hands her the scroll she received from him; in the letter, he tells her that while Naruto is young and still an idiot, he has the power to change people and will one day change himself, and that when Naruto asks her for a chance to prove himself, he hopes she trusts him. \\n\\nGuren spots a red camellia and is reminded of Yūkimaru. Meanwhile, Kiba notices the scent of a bat and under Kakashi's instructions, the team takes a detour. Kakashi explains that bats have a limited range and with the forest around them providing obstruction, they can easily keep away from the bats; however, they cannot stray too far from the enemies' vicinity nor allow the bats not to track them every now and then, as it would alert their enemies. In the village, now being an official member of the mission, Naruto heads down to the lake and asks Gamakichi to help him perfect a cooperation ninjutsu in order to use it on his mission. Gamakichi tells Naruto to get inside Gamatatsu's mouth so that the two of them can be in harmony with one another. In the meantime, Team Yamato arrive at the front gates, where Sai is dismayed that he gave in to Naruto. Sakura comforts him by telling him that Naruto would have found out eventually and the fact that he is tagging along makes for great teamwork, although she wonders why he is late.

She warns the others as Gozu attacks from behind, using a partial multi-size technique to slam a giant fist towards Kakashi, who manages to block it. As Kakashi and Gozu whisk throughout the trees continuing their battle, Hinata, Kiba and Akamaru are left to face the likes of Rinji, Kihō, Nurari and Kigiri. Not wanting to deal with Kigiri due to the mask on his face, Kiba has Akamaru transform into him as he attempts to hit Nurari with his Fang Passing Fang. Nurari is able to evade the technique as Kigiri uses his Destroying Smell Smoke Prison to create a thick smokescreen to rob Kiba and Akamaru of their sense of sight and smell.\\n\\nNurari attempts to finish the blinded Kiba off, but he is saved by Hinata, who tells Kiba to deal with the others as she deals with Nurari. Nurari is shocked when he realises that Hinata can see him, but is reassured when Hinata's Gentle Fist attacks are unable to harm him. In the meantime, Kakashi continues to fight against Gozu. Using a shadow clone to trick Gozu, Kakashi believes he has the upper hand, but Gozu is able to move at enhanced speed to elude the real Kakashi and proceeds to sneak up behind him and kick him with enough force to destroy a free.

Naruto is impatient as he wishes to save Yūkimaru, but Kakashi does not allow him to go exploring on his own due to the fact that the illusionary mist, emitted by the Three-Tails, had nearly caused him to kill his own teammate.\\n\\nGozu swims to shore and meets up with the other members of Team Guren, but promptly leaves in order to find Guren. Elsewhere, Yūkimaru watches over Guren as she wakes up, and the latter is surprised to find out that he had done so. She expresses shock when he tells her that his home is with her, but quickly falls under the effects of a fever, caused by Kabuto\\'s pills. She finds herself playing nurse for him once more, and thus, unable to regroup with the others.\\n\\nPakkun arrives in Konoha and relays Kakashi\\'s information regarding the Three-Tails to Tsunade. Realising that the Akatsuki may soon arrive if word gets out, she decides that they must acquire the beast first and thus appoints Shizune, Ino, Rock Lee and Tenten to the Orochimaru Search Team. Ino and Shizune, along with Hinata and Sakura, are tasked with using their medical ninjutsu to deal with the fūinjutsu whilst Lee and Tenten are to take over Hinata and Sakura\\'s combat duties.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Naruto and Sakura are given patrol duty but the former shirks off by a cliff in order to contemplate on Yūkimaru\\'s association with Orochimaru\\'s followers. He tells Sakura that Jiraiya had told him that home is where the people who care about you are, and that as long as people are thinking about you, they would always have a home. Believing that he is talking about Sasuke, Sakura comforts him by saying that they will never forget or give up on him and thus Konoha shall always be his home. As she walks off to resume patrol duty, Naruto reaffirms that so long as he always thinks of Yūkimaru, then the latter\\'s home would be Konoha, and thus sets off to find the boy.\\n'},\n",

Kiba, Akamaru and Sai arrive to relieve Sakura and Naruto of their patrol duty, only to find out that Naruto had gone AWOL. As Pakkun is busy leading Ino, Shizune, Rock Lee and Tenten to their location, Kakashi summons Bisuke, another ninken, and asks him to locate Naruto. He then tasks Kiba, Hinata and Shino with surveillance of their perimeter while Sai and Sakura are to provide aerial reconnaissance, telling them not to go off on their own and to work together.\\n\\nNaruto is ambushed by Guren, and the former asks her about Yūkimaru. Believing that Naruto is after Yūkimaru due to his power to control the Three-Tails, Guren attempts to kill him. However, their bout is brought to a temporary standstill by the arrival of Yūkimaru, who thanks Naruto for his words of advice. Naruto blames himself for telling Yūkimaru that and thus attempts to rectify his mistake by asking him to come to Konoha. Yūkimaru tells Naruto that Guren is nice to him and always protects him and thus she is his home; Naruto retorts that as she is one of Orochimaru's lackeys, he considers her to be just as bad as he is and that she must view Yūkimaru as merely a tool to meet her ends. Guren then attempts to flee with Yūkimaru as Naruto creates shadow clones to stop her. Guren is able to dispel the clones, and is saved by both Gozu and Yamato, the former saving Guren and Yūkimaru while the latter restrains Naruto with his Wood Release. The two jōnin admonish Naruto for leaving his team and disobeying orders while Yamato reminds him that Tsunade had trusted him to cooperate on the mission, a trust that was not given lightly.\\n\\nBack at their hideout, Kabuto notifies Guren that there are more members to the Orochimaru Search Team and tells Guren that he plans to use Yūkimaru once more to restrain and control the Three-Tails, stating that Yūkimaru is merely a tool to help serve Orochimaru and that it is Yūkimaru's only reason for existing. As Guren threatens Kabuto and walks away, muttering about Yūkimaru's health, Rinji chides her by asking whether she cares for the boy, only for Guren to claim that Yūkimaru is truly nothing but a tool to her. \\n\\nAs Naruto, Kakashi and Yamato head back to camp, Kakashi wonders why Team Guren would be bringing a young child with them. He surmises that Yūkimaru must possess a power to control the tailed beast, an assumption proved correct by Naruto, and he formulates a strategy to foil Orochimaru's plan by snatching the boy away from them. As they make their way back, Sakura jumps from Sai's ink bird and ambushes Naruto, pummelling him into the ground to teach him a lesson. As she finishes up, she tells them that Pakkun has returned with reinforcements, whom Naruto is excited to see once more.\\n\"},\n",

Yūkimaru attempts to flee when Kabuto reminds him that he belongs to Orochimaru, prompting Kabuto to yank Yūkimaru around and slap him. Immediately after, Guren slashes at Kabuto with her crystals and warns Kabuto not to lay a finger on Yūkimaru again. As Kabuto leaves, Yūkimaru reminds Guren that he would like to be wherever she is, prompting her to run away into the mist.\\n\\nOutside, Gozu begins to question Rinji's loyalty towards Guren. Rinji reassures him that he would not betray Guren as he needs the money to help his ill-struck sister. However, Rinji turns out to be a spy working for Orochimaru, who was placed within the prison by Kabuto to spy on the other inmates and subsequently assigned to Team Guren to spy on Guren herself. Rinji tells Kabuto that he believes Guren is being distracted by Yūkimaru's well being and asks Kabuto if he may report to Orochimaru himself, wanting to prove his diligence. Kabuto relents, and Rinji joins up with Guren, albeit running into Gozu first. He sneaks up on Guren, who is contemplating Naruto's words about Orochimaru using people as tools and discarding them and finding herself worrying about Yūkimaru's fate.

Incensed at Naruto's words regarding her treatment of Yūkimaru, Guren decides not to hold back and push herself to her limits, knocking Naruto out of the way and going up against Kakashi and his Lightning Cutter, although she manages to wound Kakashi with her crystal thorns.\\n\\nLee and Tenten berate Kiba for exaggerating Team Guren's prowess, with Lee hoping that the Crystal Release user would be much more powerful. However, Yamato tells him that he would not be fighting Guren, as he is assigning him and Tenten to protect the sealing team while he, Kiba and Akamaru provide backup for Kakashi's team. Sai manages to use his Ink Flush to create a nest of snakes to bind Gozu, keeping him out of the battle. Guren attempts to finish off the wounded Kakashi but the latter is saved by the arrival of Shino, whose bugs have developed a resilience towards Guren's crystal. Guren proceeds to encase all of the bugs individually, but is shocked when the bugs manage to free themselves. In the meantime, Naruto creates shadow clones and has each of them prepare a Rasengan; he then rushes towards Guren with his Ultra-Many Spiralling Serial Spheres technique. In order to protect herself, Guren uses her Crystal Release: Crystal Encampment Wall technique, which sends out a wave of chakra which turns into a nigh-impenetrable crystal wall capable of self-regeneration. \\n\\nTobi happens upon the lake and witness Shizune's team attempting to use the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier in order to seal away the Three-Tails. He proudly exclaims that he has found the Three-Tails before remembering that Deidara is not with him, and spots Rinji, who is spying on the sealing team from afar. Wanting to interfere with their plans, Rinji runs towards them as they are incapable of defending themselves, only to be repelled by the arrival of Lee and Tenten, with the former striking him with Leaf Whirlwind. Not wanting to fight two foes at once, Rinji disappears. Kabuto, who is witnessing the event, decides that he cannot allow the shinobi of Konoha to seal away the Three-Tails and decides to use Yūkimaru once more to control the tailed beast.\\n\\nGozu notices Guren's technique and realises that she is in trouble. Using his mud body, he escapes from Sai's binds and leaves Sai covered in mud. Kakashi instructs Shino to direct all of his bugs in one spot in order to create a weak spot, and attempts to strike at the spot with his Lightning Cutter, only for the attack to be blocked by Gozu. Using his mud, he pushes Guren to safety and destroys Shino's bugs while Kakashi seemingly kills him with his Lightning Cutter.\\n\\nAs Guren comes to, she wonders why Gozu would have risked his life to save her until she is wrought with a flashback of murdering Yūkimaru's mother. Wondering if it is true or not, she arrives at her hideout and is about to approach Yūkimaru when she is found by Kabuto, who tells her that she is to help him use Yūkimaru to control the Three-Tails; if she does not comply, he would break the boy's heart by revealing the truth about his mother's demise. With her doubt being confirmed, Guren reluctantly agrees, and the three take off towards the lake; Kabuto recalls Orochimaru's words to him regarding Guren - Orochimaru had told him in advance that Guren would bond with Yūkimaru due to her involvement in his mother's death, and that there would come a time when she would betray them, at which point Kabuto was to step in and prevent it.

As she waits by the clifftop for Rinji, Kabuto brings Yūkimaru to an adjacent clifftop, with a view of the Konoha shinobi attempting their Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. He reminds Yūkimaru that Guren is willing to tackle a tailed beast all on her own just to save him, and that she may die from the effort.\\n\\nRinji approaches Guren and notifies her that the two people guarding the fūinjutsu team is a weapons-user and a taijutsu expert. Knowing her chakra is limited, Guren offers herself as bait to draw the attention of the two guardians while Rinji is to take out the sealing barrier. Lee and Tenten are surprised to see the Crystal Release user in front of them, as they had believed that Kakashi's team had dealt with her.

Meanwhile, Yūkimaru spots the Three-Tails about to harm a winded-out Guren and taps into his Three-Tails Chakra: Release to control the beast and prevent Guren's death. As Rinji spots Yūkimaru, it turns out that this was Orochimaru's plan all along - he knew that Yūkimaru would not unleash his true power while being forced to do so, and would only do it to protect a loved one, hence why he tasked Guren to his protection, knowing a bond would form between them.

Asking why Naruto had not killed her when she was passed out, Naruto tells her that he would never strike somebody who was not capable of striking back.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"As Sakura heals Ino's wounds, Shizune and Hinata tend to Yūkimaru, whose Chakra Pathway System has been severely disrupted, causing him to lose the power over the Three-Tails permanently. Katsuyu, using her Slug Great Division to have one body in Tsunade's office and the other at the Orochimaru Search Team's hideout, relays Tsunade's orders that they are to return to Konoha the following morning as she sends an Anbu team to relieve them. As Yūkimaru sleeps that night, he has a vision of Guren being rescued by Gozu; during his time as one of Orochimaru's failed experiments, the sannin had left him to die until Guren had given him a ladle of water, hence explaining his loyalty and gratefulness towards her. In the middle of the night, Yūkimaru gets up and leaves the hideout in order to be with them. Naruto wakes up to see Yūkimaru gone and chases after him, while Yamato and Kakashi decide not to follow him. Naruto spots Guren's crystallised camellia and realises that there are no cracks in it, meaning that Guren is alive. Knowing that Yūkimaru is with her, Naruto uncharacteristically voices his opinion towards the team that they have no need to find Yūkimaru as he is fine; Shino and Kakashi add that Yūkimaru's importance to Konoha has been dissolved after he lost his ability to control the Three-Tails and that it is not their job to go after runaways.\\n\\nKabuto returns back home, where he tells Orochimaru that Guren has been killed and that Yūkimaru has lost his powers, apologising for not securing the Three-Tails. As Orochimaru begins to cough relentlessly, Kabuto rushes off to retrieve his medicine while musing that Orochimaru's current host has reached its limits; Orochimaru smiles as he relishes the thought of finally being able to take over Sasuke's body. Meanwhile, Deidara overhears the Anbu mentioning that the mist caused by the Three-Tails can induce hallucinations. Thanking them for the tip, he proceeds to kill them all with his Explosive Clay. He then flies over the lake on his clay bird while dropping his detonating clay spiders into the lake to disrupt and summon the tailed beast. As the Three-Tails emerges, Deidara tasks Tobi with the duty of acquiring it, which Tobi is unable to do. As Tobi is taken underwater by Deidara, Deidara uses his C1 to flip the turtle on its back and knock it out. Having defeated the turtle, Deidara uses two clay birds and ropes to tow the tailed beast back to the Akatsuki's hideout.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'Orochimaru\\'s current host body, Gen\\'yūmaru, begins to reject him, leaving the sannin to cough up blood and consider initiating his Living Corpse Reincarnation. Kabuto pulls out his Ninja Info Cards from the Chūnin Exam days three years ago, and Orochimaru recalls back when he first encountered Sasuke in the Forest of Death, when he ingested Sasuke\\'s scroll and forced Sasuke to stab himself in the leg with a kunai. He tells Kabuto that he knew that Sasuke was the perfect host body for him when he witnessed Sasuke activate his Sharingan and combine the Manipulating Windmill Triple Blades along with his Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique to burn him when he was using Shiore\\'s body; subsequently, he remembers how he had given Sasuke the Cursed Seal of Heaven and had encountered Anko shortly after that. Orochimaru goes on to reminisce about Sasuke had fared in his match against Yoroi Akadō, and how Yoroi had begun using his chakra absorption in an attempt to draw out Sasuke\\'s cursed seal, only for Sasuke to repress it with willpower and defeat Yoroi with his Lion Combo. Kabuto remarks that this is when Orochimaru had decided to stick around and witness the rest of the exams, which Orochimaru claimed was a good idea as Sasuke had improved considerably by his second match, in which he had used the Chidori against Gaara. As Orochimaru continues to hack up blood, Kabuto excuses himself to fetch more medicine.\\n\\nKabuto muses how Orochimaru is the only person he\\'d always be loyal to and faithfully serve, recalling Orochimaru\\'s attack on Konoha, how he managed to kill the Third Hokage and the Fourth Kazekage, and the fact that he was able go up against both Jiraiya and Tsunade. In Konoha, Tsunade is told by an Anbu that the squad sent to the lake have disappeared and that the Three-Tails is no longer there, prompting the Hokage to dispatch another squad. Concurrently, Sasuke remembers observing Itachi perfectly hit all targets with his shurikenjutsu and manages to obliterate all of his targets with his Chidori Current. Satisfied with his progress, he walks to Orochimaru\\'s room, where he uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to go through the door in an attempt to impale Orochimaru\\'s heart. Orochimaru manages to block the attack with his forearms and marvels at the perfect use of both shape and nature transformation as Sasuke uses his sword to slice through the door. He tells Orochimaru that the sannin has nothing left to teach him and reveals that he had all intentions of giving up his body but does not wish to do so now that he is stronger than Orochimaru. He notes that he was always aware that all Orochimaru wanted was the power of the Uchiha Clan and the Sharingan but was no match for Itachi, and thus chose to go after the \"baby of the clan\". He adds that he finds Orochimaru\\'s need for experiments on humans and ingestion of strange medicines in order to disrupt nature disgusting and that his efforts to become all-powerful and reach the level of Uchiha as pathetic, and even states that in his eyes Orochimaru along with other geniuses could never hope to match the prowess and talents of the Uchiha clan and are merely average compared to the Uchiha. Enraged, Orochimaru reveals his true form to Sasuke and attempts to steal his body, only for Sasuke to slice away all the snakes that bind him. Activating his cursed seal to the second stage, he tells Orochimaru that the latter is like a snake who was confined to the ground and wished to fly, and thus nurtured a baby bird in his own nest, only for the baby bird to grow into a hawk that will hunt the snake; Orochimaru then lunges at Sasuke in a rage.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"As Sasuke fights Orochimaru's true form with his Cursed Seal of Heaven's second stage, Orochimaru thinks back upon his past. At a young age, he found the shed skin of a white snake, and asked his sensei, the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, what it meant. Hiruzen had told him that the white snake's skin was rare and that it was renown as a sign of good luck and renewal, possibly meaning that his parents may be reborn someday. Years later, during a mission, he witnessed Tsunade's brother Nawaki dying and remarked that the lifespan and vulnerability of humans were weaknesses, and eventually began seeking out a reanimation technique.\\n\\nSome time later, he had gained Anko as an apprentice, who had noticed the white snake skin Orochimaru had kept. He had told her that he was experimenting not only with reanimation but also with regeneration. During this time, he also witnessed Itachi Uchiha's prowess with the Sharingan and began to covet the power of the Uchiha clan's kekkei genkai. Soon after finding various scrolls in a tome, he had realised that there was no way one could learn and master all the forbidden techniques in a single lifespan and thus focused on mastering the Living Corpse Reincarnation technique in an attempt to gain immortality. However, he had later been caught doing experiments with the dead by the Third Hokage, and thus fled Konoha, although not before engaging in a battle with his old teammate Jiraiya.\\n\\nAfter having escaped from Jiraiya, Orochimaru had joined the criminal organisation known as the Akatsuki and was pleasantly surprised to have learned that their new member and his partner was none other than Itachi himself. He had then attempted to use his transference technique in an attempt to steal Itachi's body, only for Itachi to effortlessly trap him in a genjutsu with his Sharingan. Trapped within the Demonic Illusion: Shackling Stakes Technique, Itachi proceeded to cut off Orochimaru's left arm before he could try to dispel the genjutsu and had told the sannin that there was no techniques he could use that his Sharingan would not see through. After that, Orochimaru had deserted the Akatsuki and lay in wait as Sasuke came to him, believing that Sasuke would be his future host body.\\n\\nIn the present day, Sasuke manages to use his sword to slice through Orochimaru's snake form, wondering if the battle is over and stating that it was a disappointment. As his curse mark recedes, Orochimaru laughs as the toxic fumes emitted from his body paralyses Sasuke. With Sasuke weakened, Orochimaru initiates his immortality jutsu, intent on finally taking Sasuke's body for his own. Kabuto, who had been elsewhere preparing medicine, notices that Orochimaru's door is destroyed and peeks inside to see Sasuke's body standing up while the white snake is on the floor. He wonders whether the Sasuke in front of him is the real Sasuke or Orochimaru, only for Sasuke to use his Sharingan on Kabuto to show him what had happened.\\n\\nWhile Orochimaru had transported himself and Sasuke to a mental plane in order to take over his body, Sasuke had used his Sharingan to reverse the effects of Orochimaru's technique, eroding the environment. He had repeated Itachi's words to Orochimaru on how his Sharingan was able to see through any of his techniques, and proceeded to absorb Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto is shocked to discover that Orochimaru is now effectively gone, while Sasuke triumphantly leaves the hideout with a smirk on his face.\\n\\nIn Konoha, Naruto, Tsunade and Jiraiya notice the blood red sunset and consider it a bad omen; while on a mission, Anko hears a rustling sound and throws a kunai in its direction, only to pin and kill a white snake. Remembering Orochimaru, she then clutches at her cursed seal. Concurrently, Itachi and Kisame are on a walk when Itachi notices the blood red sunset as well.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Sometime in the past, Sasuke had told Suigetsu Hōzuki, a prisoner of Orochimaru's, that he would free him one day. After having killed Orochimaru, Sasuke makes good on his promise and frees Suigetsu from his water tank. After being freed, Sasuke tells Suigetsu that he is the first member to be added to a team he is forming, along with Karin of the Southern Hideout and Jūgo of the Northern Hideout. Suigetsu shows no desire to join Sasuke's team at first, but decides to join under the condition that Sasuke help him find Kubikiribōchō, the sword of Zabuza Momochi, who was one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, since it was Sasuke's squad that defeated Zabuza.\\n\\nSasuke and Suigetsu head to the Land of Waves, where Sasuke notices that the name of the bridge is called the Great Naruto Bridge. Suigetsu asks whether Zabuza was tough, and Sasuke recalls his first encounter with Zabuza, as well as when Zabuza trapped Kakashi inside of his Water Prison Technique. Sasuke is snapped out of his reverie by Suigetsu and merely crosses the bridge and enters the village, where they nearly get into a fight with a rude villager. After heading to Zabuza and Haku's Grave, they discover that Kubikiribōchō, which Kakashi had buried there along with Zabuza, is missing. After heading to a village restaurant, Suigetsu notices all the girls there fawning over Sasuke and tells them that Sasuke is looking for the blade, prompting them all to tell him that Tazuna knows its location. Sasuke remembers meeting him and tells Suigetsu that Tazuna was the bridge builder who built the Great Naruto Bridge. However, when they get to Tazuna's house, they discover that both he and his grandson Inari left for the Land of Lightning and would not return for a year; however, a worker there does tell them that he knows the whereabouts of Kubikiribōchō, and that it is in the possession of a corrupt boss named Tenzen Daikoku.\\n\\nIn the village, Suigetsu and Sasuke come across the rude villager once more and Suigetsu threatens him to give up Tenzen's location. That night, Sasuke infiltrates the castle and points his sword at Tenzen, telling him that his name is Suigetsu and that he would attack tomorrow with an army, and to have tens of thousands of men ready. As Tenzen rallies his troops, Sasuke merely tells Suigetsu that there is a rival group clashing against Tenzen and that he should use the opportunity to seize Kubikiribōchō. Sasuke makes a wager with Suigetsu in which they deal with Tenzen's men without killing any of them and enters into the fray, defeating one half with ease. As the other half approaches, Sasuke disappears, leaving Suigetsu to deal with them. Suigetsu is able to easily defeat them and heads inside the mansion, only to be bisected by Tenzen's Bodyguard, who wields the Kubikiribōchō.\\n\\nUtilising his Hydrification Technique to liquefy and rejoin his bottom half, Suigetsu tells them that he cannot be harmed by blades. He then uses his Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique to pry Zabuza's blade out of the bodyguard's arms, sending the bodyguard flying. Suigetsu wishes to kill Tenzen as Tenzen has been spreading rumours that he was the one who killed Zabuza, only to be interrupted by Sasuke, who convinces Suigetsu not to kill him. As Suigetsu destroys the pillars around the house to give Tenzen a chance to live, Tenzen demands to know whether this Sasuke is the very one who killed Orochimaru, surprising Suigetsu that the word has already spread. As the duo leave the Land of Waves, Suigetsu realises that Sasuke knew the blade had been taken and had set up the whole thing with Tenzen's army in order for Sasuke to test his strength. They then head to the Southern Hideout, where Karin is located, who manages to knock a man out after stating that Orochimaru's death does not grant him the right to do whatever he pleases. However, she quickly senses a powerful and frightening chakra nearby.\\n\"},\n",

Sasuke tells Suigetsu that his plan is to recruit Karin for his team. Suigetsu asks why he is putting together a team and why he would want Karin on it, as he finds her unpleasant and difficult to deal with. Sasuke responds that he had been thinking of forming a team for quite some time now as it would help him further his goals, and tells Suigetsu that Karin has a special ability which makes her unique. At the hideout, Karin manages to sense their chakra before the duo arrive.\\n\\nSuigetsu uses his Kubikiribōchō to break down the door of the hideout and the pair enter, walking by prisoners, who were discussing whether the rumors of Orochimaru's death were true. After seeing Sasuke walk inside without Orochimaru, they begin to believe in the validity of the rumors, although some refuse to believe it. Sasuke and Suigetsu run into Karin, and they decide to talk in a separate room. Karin refuses Sasuke's offer, claiming that her place is to be the warden of the prison and asks whether Sasuke had truly killed Orochimaru. Sasuke confirms her doubt, and Suigetsu states that word of Orochimaru's death should have already reached the prison and Sasuke reveals that he had noticed freshly dug graves outside as he was walking in; Suigetsu pieces together that Karin had a spy located in the cells and was killing off any prisoners who were discussing Orochimaru's fate. Sasuke then asks Suigetsu to free the prisoners; as Suigetsu leaves, Karin locks herself inside the room with Sasuke.\\n\\nSuigetsu gets to the cells, where he promises to free all the prisoners so long as they spread the word that Sasuke took down Orochimaru and subsequently freed them, to which the prisoners hastily agree. Inside the room, Karin removes her glasses and changes her tone to a seductive voice, attempting to nuzzle next to Sasuke and agreeing to join his team. She recalls their first encounter, in which Orochimaru had tasked Sasuke to retrieve escaped prisoners and had ordered Karin to use her special chakra sensing ability in order to assist him. Karin had noticed that Sasuke had not killed anyone, and Sasuke had responded that there was only one person whom he wanted to kill. Karin noticed Sasuke's chakra at those words and was excited by it, and ended up distracted. When her distraction leads her to fall off a tree, Sasuke saved her and killed a prisoner who was attempting to use the chance to take out Karin. \\n\\nAs Sasuke tells Karin not to get too close to him, Suigetsu uses his Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique along with his Kubikiribōchō to break down the door. Sasuke alerts Suigetsu that Karin had accepted his proposal, but with the arrival of Suigetsu, Karin puts her glasses back on and reverts to her old, cold tone, telling them that she had never agreed to do such a thing. However, with no prisoners to keep watch over and her growing attraction towards Sasuke, she tells them that she is headed in the same direction as they are and thus would be joining them for part of the way. The three then set off to recruit the final member of the team — Jūgo, who is shackled in the Northern Hideout.\\n\"},\n",

Karin warns them that Jūgo is an individual with repressed maniacal urges who becomes homicidal when he snaps, and that Orochimaru extracted fluids secreted from his enzymes in order to create his cursed seals. At the hideout, they discover that the guard is missing and are subsequently attacked by a prisoner, who is in the second stage of his cursed seal. Having killed all the guards, the prisoner decides to attack Sasuke, only for Sasuke to cut him down with his sword. As they enter the hideout, they are faced with various other prisoners also in the second stage of their cursed seals, and Sasuke asks Suigetsu to deal with them without killing them.\\n\\nAs Jūgo sits in his cell, he recalls on how he was once cooled off during a murderous rampage by Kimimaro, who had promised him that he would be there for him. Musing that Kimimaro is no longer with him, Jūgo constantly states that if a man were to walk through the door, he would kill him, only to continuously state that he would do the same if it were a woman. As Sasuke's team make their way through the hideout, Karin sends Suigetsu down the wrong hallway in order to be alone with Sasuke, and leads him to Jūgo's cell. As Karin unlocks the door, Jūgo states that if it is a woman, he would kill her; however, just as she is about to open the door, Jūgo claims that he would kill whomever if it is a man, and is greeted by Sasuke, who opens the door. Jūgo enters into a partial transformation and attacks Sasuke, who also undergoes a partial transformation into the second stage of his cursed seal. Repelling Jūgo's attack, Sasuke tells Jūgo that he is not here to fight but to merely talk to him.\\n\\nIn Konoha, Naruto and Sakura are summoned to Tsunade's office, where both she and Jiraiya tell the duo that Orochimaru has been killed by Sasuke.

Jūgo claims that he cannot leave the Northern Hideout without Kimimaro and continues to attack Sasuke. It turns out that in the past, it was Kimimaro who had recruited Jūgo to join Orochimaru and had promised to restrain Jūgo\\'s murderous impulses with his Shikotsumyaku acting as a cage. Suigetsu arrives, and is told by Karin that Jūgo is bipolar and relied on Kimimaro to help him, and thus had joined Orochimaru willingly in order to find a way to repress his urges. As Sasuke attempts to avoid Jūgo\\'s attacks, Suigetsu interferes, blocking the strike with his Kubikiribōchō.

The team\\'s leader, Minato Namikaze, tells them they have a new mission, and that since Kakashi has just become a jōnin, he would be leading himself, Obito and their other teammate Rin Nohara while he goes on his own mission. In order to celebrate Kakashi\\'s promotion, Minato gives Kakashi a Flying Thunder God Kunai while Rin gives him a specially made medic-kit. Obito, however, has forgotten to bring a gift for Kakashi and is vexed when Kakashi states that it would have been useless anyways.\\n\\nMinato tells them that as they are involved in a war, Iwagakure has invaded Kusagakure near the Land of Fire and that Kakashi\\'s team are to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in order to cripple their efforts. Meanwhile, he would engage in combat in the front lines in order to provide a suitable distraction. On their way, Kakashi spots Mahiru, an Iwa-nin who is conducting surveillance. Minato notices that Mahiru has employed about twenty shadow clones while Kakashi tells him that he has a new technique that should be able to deal with them all. With his Chidori, Kakashi plows through the shadow clones and rushes towards the real Mahiru; however, Kakashi\\'s Chidori causes him to have tunnel vision and thus does not see Mahiru pull out a sword. Before Mahiru can kill Kakashi, Minato manages to save him from the blow whilst simultaneously marking Mahiru\\'s foot, although Kakashi ends up being slashed near his underarm. \\n\\nAs Rin tends to Kakashi\\'s wounds, Minato uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to appear before Mahiru, placing a kunai next to the Iwa-nin\\'s throat. Mahiru expresses his regret for recognising Minato as the famed \"Konoha\\'s Yellow Flash\" and for not retreating as per Iwagakure\\'s rules; Minato then kills Mahiru. As they camp that night, Obito expresses his displeasure of being a failure from the elite Uchiha Clan while having to deal with Kakashi\\'s genius. Minato reveals that Kakashi is the way he is because his father Sakumo, who was known as the \"Konoha\\'s White Fang\", had once broken the law by choosing to save the lives of his comrades over completing the mission and was thus vilified by both the village and the very friends he had saved. Unable to cope, Sakumo took his own life. Since then, Kakashi had chosen never to speak of his father and vowed to uphold the rules and regulations of the shinobi world.\\n\\nThe following morning, Minato sets off on his own mission while Obito decides to pledge his loyalty to his new captain, Kakashi, much to the team\\'s surprise. On their way to the bridge, they are spotted by two enemies from Iwa. While one of them distracts Kakashi and Obito, the other uses a camouflage technique to abduct Rin. Obito claims that they should go and save Rin, only for Kakashi to remind him that the law is to complete the mission even at the expense of their comrades, and that they should not let emotions cloud their judgment. Obito declares that he will not follow Kakashi\\'s orders, and as he walks away, he tells Kakashi that he personally views the White Fang as a hero; he also adds that while shinobi who break the rules are considered scum, those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.

Taiseki decides to deal with Obito while Kakkō continues using his Interrogation Genjutsu on Rin in an attempt to break her. Using his Hiding with Camouflage Technique, Taiseki sneaks up on Obito and prepares to kill him with a kunai, only for Kakashi to interfere and slash at Taiseki with his White Light Chakra Sabre. Seeing the sabre and the white hair, he wonders whether Kakashi is the Konoha\\'s famed \"White Fang\", only to realise that he is just his son.

Obito picks Kakashi up and notices a big boulder above their head, and throws Kakashi out of the way, taking the brunt of the boulder\\'s impact on himself. As Kakashi and Rin come to, they discover Obito pinned underneath the boulder, the entire left side of his body crushed. Kakashi begins to cry, as he believes he could have prevented this had he chosen to follow Obito at the beginning and that it did not matter that he was jōnin and thus captain of the team. Remembering that he had not given Kakashi a gift for his promotion, he asks Rin to transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi\\'s left eye socket. With the transplant completed, Kakashi rushes outside the cave and uses his White Light Chakra Sabre to attack Kakkō. As Kakkō destroys the blade, Kakashi uses his Chidori to strike the Iwa-nin and kills him. As the other Iwa-nin arrive, one of them uses his Earth Release: Tearing Earth Turning Palm cause the entire cave to collapse; Kakashi escapes with Rin as Obito is buried in the rubble, where he muses in his last moments that he is saddened to die right when he and Kakashi had finally begun to get along and that he never told Rin that he loved her. Outside, Kakashi and Rin are ambushed by the surrounding Iwa-nin, and Kakashi tells Rin to flee while he fights them off, as he had promised Obito that he would protect Rin with his life. Kakashi tells Rin that Obito had loved her and that she was everything to him, as Rin attempts to tell Kakashi that she has feelings for him. As Kakashi prepares his Chidori, they are saved by the arrival of Minato, who uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to defeat all of their enemies.\\n\\nAs he comes to, Kakashi asks how Minato had arrived to save them and Minato reveals that the marking on the Flying Thunder God Kunai he had given Kakashi allows him to teleport to that location; he also adds that Rin had told him what had transpired. Following the destruction of the Kannabi Bridge, the Third Hokage declared that two heroes were born that day, each with their own Sharingan.

The leader also adds his fear that Sasuke may wage war against the entirety of the Akatsuki soon, while Zetsu notifies them that Sasuke has formed a team, whose members include Suigetsu Hōzuki of Kirigakure. Knowing that Sasuke is after Itachi and that Suigetsu is after Kisame, the leader tells the pair to be on their guard; they then begin the sealing process of the two tailed beasts in their possession.\\n\\nAfter the sealing process is complete, Deidara contemplates who his target shall be, claiming that he wishes to settle the score with Naruto for punching him in the face as well as Kakashi for having removed his right arm, and that he wishes to take out Sasuke as punishment for robbing him of the chance of eliminating Orochimaru. Meanwhile, Sasuke's team Hebi make their way to an Uchiha Clan munitions base, run by an old woman who goes by Nekobaa. Nekobaa expresses her thoughts over Sasuke and Itachi fighting each other to the death, as she had known both of them since they were young.\\n\\nIn Konoha, Tsunade contemplates Naruto's idea to apprehend Itachi in order to bring Sasuke back to the village. Kakashi claims he has an idea, and asks to be excused alone with the two Sannin in the room. Shortly after, Tsunade makes the Itachi Pursuit Mission official as Kakashi forms an Eight Man Squad for the task, consisting of Team 7 under Yamato's command and Team 8 under his own command.\\n\"},\n",

Their task is to find the location of Sasuke or Itachi and report back. In the meantime, Sasuke assigns individual tasks to each member of Hebi in hopes of finding a way to Itachi.\\n\\nDue to the fact that he is a jinchūriki and thus a target of the Akatsuki, Naruto is given additional protection in the form of Yamato and Hinata as well as being assigned Bull, the biggest hound in Kakashi's pack. Elsewhere, Deidara and Tobi begin their search for either Naruto, Kakashi or Sasuke. While riding on one of his clay birds, Deidara claims to have spotted one of them, although he keeps the identity of whom a secret from Tobi.\\n\\nWhile Suigetsu locates Kyōya and Ginji, the accountant and banker of Akatsuki member Kakuzu, Karin is sent to a village to find a clue to the Akatsuki's whereabouts. Unbeknownst to her, Sakura is in the same village, with Bisuke and Shiba managing to locate Sasuke's scent, which is coming from Karin. However, Karin and Sakura pass each other and the scent is lost. Naruto, Yamato and Hinata are ambushed by Kabuto, who gives them Orochimaru's gathered intelligence on the Akatsuki. When asked why he would give up such a thing, Kabuto tells Naruto that he is grateful towards him; ever since Kabuto was a child, he was used as a spy and thus moved from village to village until he became Orochimaru's subordinate. After Orochimaru had died, he felt as though he had lost his purpose and identity until he realised that Naruto had forged his own identity when the villagers thought he was no more than a human variant of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Kabuto reveals the left side of his body to the trio, which resembles Orochimaru, and explains that he had grafted portions of Orochimaru's corpse onto himself as a way of clinging to his dead master and that he plans to avenge Orochimaru by eliminating Sasuke. With that said, Kabuto flees, evading capture.\\n\\nIn a clearing, Sasuke senses Tobi's presence and notices Deidara flying above him, the latter dropping two C1 bombs on him. Believing they have killed him, they realise that Sasuke summoned a snake to shield him from the damage. With his Sharingan activated, Sasuke glares at Deidara, who stares back.\\n\"},\n",

Using his sword, Sasuke rushes at Deidara and Tobi; Deidara leaps on a tree branch to evade the attack while Tobi is sliced through, although he is unharmed by the attack. Using his explosive clay to create C1 clay spiders, he attacks Sasuke, who uses his Chidori Senbon to take out the spiders. Deidara then ups the ante by using Explosive Clay Dolls. Sasuke attempts to impale them with his sword, only for the sword to get stuck. Relying on taijutsu for a while, Sasuke applies his Lightning Release to his sword to slice through both clay dolls. However, the bisected dolls begin to reemerge as smaller versions, all of them chasing Sasuke through the forest. As they envelop Sasuke, Deidara detonates them, but Sasuke evades the blow with a Body Replacement Technique.\\n\\nDeidara decides to use his C2 and moulds his C2 Clay Dragon, regurgitating C2 landmines and taking flight. In an attempt to ground the bird, Sasuke attempts to impale it with his Chidori Sharp Spear, only to be out of range whilst simultaneously revealing its five metre limit to Deidara. Deidara accuses Sasuke of using Kakashi's technique, although he gives credit for the shape transformation Sasuke had applied to it. Tobi, under Deidara's command, places Explosive Landmines all around the ground while the C2 dragon fires clay missiles towards Sasuke, forcing the latter to enter into the second stage of his cursed seal in order to use the wings it grants to fly away from danger. \\n\\nNoticing that Sasuke's leg seems injured, Deidara fires another projectile missile at Sasuke, who uses his left wing to shield himself from it, albeit losing the wing in the process. Seeing as Sasuke is unable to fly without his wing, Deidara lowers his altitude slightly while Sasuke uses the Manipulated Shuriken Technique to throw two giant shuriken at him, who dodges it. Throwing his sword with precise accuracy to impale the ground, Sasuke uses it as a foothold and then leaps into the air, using the height gained to further the reach of his Chidori Sharp Spear, successfully slicing Deidara's C2 Clay Dragon in two. Pulling the wire threads he had used to manipulate the two shuriken, Sasuke impales both of Deidara's forearms, pinning him to the dragon which then explodes.\\n\\nDeidara survives the explosion, having created a clay bird, and glares at Sasuke and his Sharingan. He recalls when he was coerced into joining the Akatsuki by Itachi, and how he had developed a hatred for both the Sharingan and Itachi since. Deidara then uses the most powerful clay in his arsenal, the C4, and fashions it into a giant clay version of himself, while musing that his original intention was to use the C4 Karura to kill Itachi.\\n\"},\n",

He believes that he has killed Sasuke in that manner, only for Sasuke to have used Genjutsu: Sharingan to trick Deidara. Having entered into the second stage of his cursed seal, Sasuke strikes Deidara from behind with his Chidori, intentionally missing Deidara's vital spots in order to question him about Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara inquires as to how Sasuke had evaded the attack, Sasuke reveals that his Sharingan sees chakra as colours and thus was able to see the nano-bombs.\\n\\nHowever, the Deidara Sasuke has in his grip is none other than a Clay Clone, while the real Deidara pops out of the clay bird and holds Sasuke's feet. Using his mouth to create another C4 Karura, Deidara has Sasuke trapped inside while leaping off the bird. Sasuke uses his Chidori to escape the Karura, although the C4 nano-bombs are already within Sasuke's system; Deidara then denotaes the C4, believing he has finally killed Sasuke.\\n\\nSasuke, nonetheless, survives the attack and punches Deidara, demanding to know Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara questions how he had survived, Sasuke explains that he had seen Deidara's hand signs with his Sharingan and thus realised it was an Earth Release technique, which is vulnerable to Lightning Release. Sasuke reveals that he had tested the theory out when he had struck Deidara's clay spiders with his Chidori Senbon; however, due to Tobi being near the spiders' range, he was not sure whether it was his attack or Deidara that had prevented the spiders' detonation. Hence, he had tried it once more when he had infused his Chidori into his sword to pierce a landmine, which was not under Deidara's control. When the landmine did not explode, Sasuke's theory was confirmed, and thus he had struck himself with his own Chidori to disable the nano-bombs in his system; he also takes the opportunity to correct Deidara by telling him that he uses the Chidori, not the Lightning Cutter, which Deidara had been referring to it as during their battle. Along with that, he also reveals even if it didn't work, he has another hidden technique to be used, leaving Deidara in begrudging shock of Sasuke's abilities.\\n\\nHowever, Sasuke has ran out of chakra and collapses after negating a surprise attack from Deidara, who delightfully laughs as he still has some Explosive Clay left and declares this fight as his but is left incensed that Sasuke remains unworried. His composure utterly broken, Deidara shouts on how he despises Sasuke and Itachi for their cool and calm demeanour and how they used their dojutsu to just so easily handle and judge his art, which doesn't faze Sasuke, who simply asks him where Itachi is and even went as far as to deactivate his Sharingan, leaving Deidara even more furious. Deidara proceeds to pull his shirt off and uses the teeth in his palm to pull apart strings located above his heart, revealing another mouth. Ingesting his C0 clay, Deidara decides to detonate himself, telling Sasuke that the range of his attack goes up to 10 kilometres and that both he and Sasuke would die as a result, taking gleeful joy that while he would be remembered for his explosive art, which would cause a crater in the very earth itself, Sasuke would be forgotten. Deidara then proceeds to detonate himself, claiming that true art is an explosion.\\n\"},\n",

Zetsu, a member of the Akatsuki, witnesses Deidara's explosion, and judging by the blasts, believes that Sasuke and Tobi have died as well. Zetsu reports this to the other Akatsuki members and the Akatsuki leader asks them to mourn. Kisame expresses that while he misses Tobi, at least Deidara had taken Sasuke out with him. As the other members leave, Itachi walks outside in the rain, where Kisame states that it looks like Itachi is crying, and offers his condolences regarding Sasuke's demise. Itachi, however, tells Kisame that Sasuke is still alive.\\n\\nSuigetsu, noticing that the snake on a scroll Sasuke had given him has disappeared, uses a drop of Sasuke's blood he has on his person to summon Manda, one of Orochimaru's snakes. Sasuke exits from the snake, revealing that he had summoned Manda and had jumped inside of it to escape Deidara's blast radius, although they both got hit before teleporting away. Manda curses Sasuke with his dying breath for using his Sharingan to control him and use him as a shield. Seeing as Sasuke is injured, Suigetsu, who had been joined by Jūgo and Karin at that time, retreats to a safehouse, where Jūgo tends to Sasuke's wounds. As Suigetsu and Karin get into a fight, Jūgo's murderous impulses begin to manifest, only for Sasuke to use his Sharingan to eradicate the urges. Sasuke instantly passes out from his fatigue, as the other three members decide to stay on Hebi under Sasuke's command.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Eight Man Squad head to the crater, where the ninja hounds have located Sasuke's scent. Kakashi notifies them that one of the scents is that of Deidara of the Akatsuki, whom he had previously thought was dead, and Shino states that Sasuke must have fought him. While the team contemplates whether Sasuke had been eliminated from the blast or if he had escaped, Kiba confirms that it is the latter, as he is still able to track a faint scent with his acute sense of smell; the team then heads off to find Sasuke.\\n\\nElsewhere, the leader of the Akatsuki, revealed to be named Pain, along his partner Konan begin discussing plans with a masked man, who is implied to be the real leader of the organisation. The masked man tells Pain and Konan that Sasuke is still alive, and that he would approach them soon; however, he warns them that they must also deal with the Nine-Tails jinchūriki as soon as possible, reminding them that Naruto has learned techniques formidable enough to destroy two of Kakuzu's hearts and that he has powerful allies as well. Konan tells the masked man not to worry as Pain has never lost a fight before. The masked man turns around, revealed to be none other than Tobi, who states that he will have the power of the Sharingan as he is the one and only Madara Uchiha.\\n\"},\n",

Tsunade decides to mobilise an attack unit until Jiraiya reminds her that they should not be haste, and offers to discuss the situation over a drink. Elsewhere, the Eight Man Squad follow Kiba's sense of smell towards Sasuke, who is sleeping off his injuries. Karin, who was sent to fetch supplies, sense the chakra of both the shinobi and their ninken and warns Sasuke. Sasuke orders Hebi to move out, claiming that the sheer number of forces would indicate that it is a Konoha unit and not the Akatsuki, as the latter move in two-man teams. As Sasuke and Suigetsu head out, Karin asks Jūgo to tie pieces of Sasuke's clothing to birds in order to disperse his scent, making it harder for the ninken to track him.\\n\\nOver a bottle of sake, Jiraiya tells Tsunade that Pain lives in Amegakure, an isolated hidden village wedged between the Lands of Earth, Wind and Fire, a place often used as a battleground by the three nations, thus creating numerous refugees. Jiraiya tells Tsunade that due to the isolated nature of the village, many nations do not know that a civil war transpired within Ame and that one half of the village is run by Pain himself. Tsunade worries over Jiraiya going alone, as she deems that Pain must be strong in order to be the leader of formidably powerful individuals that are members of the Akatsuki; Jiraiya, however, reminds her that he is one of the Three Legendary Sannin and that he is more than capable of going alone. Tsunade reminds Jiraiya how their sensei, the Third Hokage, had wanted Jiraiya to succeed him as the Fourth only for Jiraiya to refuse, and how Jiraiya felt despair after being unable to prevent Orochimaru's decline into darkness, hence why he had monitored his old teammate's activities for years. Jiraiya replies spitefully that he does not need to worry about that no more and Tsunade muses on how she never thought Orochimaru would die. Jiraiya recalls the past all three shared, how Tsunade went from a flat-chested girl to a woman with a full bosom, and how they've both grown old despite Tsunade holding all the memories of her loved ones inside of her ample bosom, causing Tsunade to blush.\\n\\nIn the woods, Kiba tells the group that Sasuke's scent has dispersed, causing Naruto to use his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to spread out and find Sasuke. He ends up finding Itachi, who tells Naruto that he merely wishes to talk. When Naruto refuses to listen and attempts to attack him, Itachi uses his Demonic Illusion: Mirage Crow to place him within a genjutsu. As the genjutsu fades, Itachi leaves; the rest of the team find Naruto shortly after, who hides his encounter from them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sasuke manages to reach one of the Akatsuki hideouts that Jūgo had found, telling Hebi to stay outside while he checks it out. Back in Konoha, Jiraiya is prepared to leave when Tsunade tells Jiraiya to summon her if things get bad. Jiraiya reminds Tsunade that she cannot leave the village as she is Hokage, only for Tsunade to retort that Kakashi could succeed her and eventually Naruto as well. Jiraiya laughs at Tsunade's high hopes for Naruto, knowing that her hope comes from the fact that he shares the same dream as her brother and lover and is the only one of the three who did not die. Tsunade retorts that Jiraiya has the very same expectations for Naruto, having taught him the Rasengan. Jiraiya explains that he only did it for nostalgic purposes as Naruto reminds him of his student Minato Namikaze, who became the Fourth Hokage. Tsunade muses how Naruto reminds her of his father Minato due to their looks, but that his personality is more akin to his mother Kushina Uzumaki, a kunoichi from Uzushiogakure. Jiraiya reveals that while he never had children, he thinks of Minato as a son he could be proud of, and Naruto as his grandson by extension. \\n\\nJiraiya decides the time for his departure has arrived, and Tsunade tearfully tells him to return back to her safely, as she does not wish to lose him. Jiraiya asks whether she would cry for him and seems as if he was about to confess love for her, only to laugh it off as Tsunade blushes. Due to her bad luck at winning, he tells her to gamble everything on his death so that her bad luck may keep him safe. As he sets off, he reminds her to be wary of Root, which she acknowledges.

Amazed at how they were able to escape its effects, Jiraiya tries to destroy the Preta Path with an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan; however, the Path proceeds to absorb the technique and render it useless.\\n\\nJiraiya, Fukasaku and Shima decide to escape through the pipes, wondering how to defeat three Rinnegan wielders as neither ninjutsu or taijutsu would work on them. Since Jiraiya does not use genjutsu, a fact that Pain is aware of, Jiraiya asks the two toads to use their genjutsu, which he would not be expecting, while he tries out a gamble of his. Since Fukasaku was able to deduce that the three Paths shared the same vision through their Rinnegan eyes, Jiraiya has the toads lure them with their genjutsu, which involves croaking frog sounds that reveal their location to Pain. As the three Paths rush towards them, Jiraiya hits one of them with his Fire Release: Big Flame Bullet. After the Path absorbs it, Jiraiya's theory is confirmed — each of the Paths only possesses one ability, hence why the earlier Animal Path had only summoned creatures to fight Jiraiya instead of using actual jutsu. The three Paths are struck by the toads' Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant, and Jiraiya proceeds to use three stone swords to impale them.\\n\\nAs he walks away, believing he has killed them, he is struck from behind by another Path, who manages to destroy Jiraiya's left arm. Pain then brings forth five other bodies, including the three that Jiraiya had just impaled. He reveals that Pain is just an alias, meant to refer to the Six Paths of Pain, while Jiraiya seems to recognise one of the Paths.\\n\"},\n",

Seconds after Jiraiya successfully entered the village, he was detected by Pain. Wandering around the village, Jiraiya speaks to the inhabitants about their leader, Pain. Unsuccessful in gathering information he captures two ninja of the village, who tell him about their mysterious new leader Pain, who single handedly defeated Hanzō, the former leader of Ame. Before acting further, Jiraiya summoned Gerotora and instructed him to store himself in Naruto should anything happen to him, speculating that Madara Uchiha was responsible for the Nine-Tails attack on Konoha in the past. Meanwhile Pain knowing that an intruder had infiltrated the village, orders Konan to search for the intruder. She then transforms into multiple origami papers to seek the intruder out. Konan locates Jiraiya, and informed Pain, who then changes bodies in a secret chamber. \\n\\nJiraiya enters Sage Mode.\\nKonan then went ahead and attacked Jiraiya, who fought, evenly matched, with her for a short time. Jiraiya then spoke about his history with Konan, Yahiko, and Nagato. When Pain arrives, they discuss Pain\\'s personal ideology, and Akatsuki\\'s goals. Pain, who is convinced Jiraiya is to die anyway, reveals his reasoning behind collecting the tailed beasts which was to create a kinjutsu which could wipe away entire nations, so that the world would \"mature\" and develop aversion for war. Finishing their talk, Pain summons a crustacean to attack Jiraiya, who defeats it and summons Gamaken. Having no other choice left, Jiraiya and Gamaken begin their battle against Pain. Camouflaging himself, Pain summons multiple creatures to defeat Jiraiya. Realising that he is up against a powerful foe, Jiraiya uses a barrier and prepares to enter Sage Mode. Due to the predicament Gamaken has, he sustains deep wounds from the battle. As Jiraiya has his technique ready to use, Gamaken leaves the battle, and Jiraiya enters Sage Mode after summoning Fukasaku and Shima.\\n\\nJiraiya \"kills\" three of the Paths.\\nJiraiya soon finds Pain, who summons two of his other Paths to enter the battle. Jiraiya blinds one of the new Pains with a kick to the face, and Fukasaku suspects that all three Pain\\'s share the same eyes and vision after they countered all their attacks, while Jiraiya realises that each of the bodies has only one specific purpose. Jiraiya stalls for time while Fukasaku and Shima prepare a powerful genjutsu to defeat the bodies and are successful in doing so. Jiraiya had a flash back to when he first met the Toad Sage, who had told him that he would be a pervert, travel the world, write a book, and would train the destined child who would either save or destroy the world. Leaving the bodies behind, another Pain attacked Jiraiya from behind and severed his arm off. Being confronted by the full attendance of the six paths of pain, Jiraiya was able to discover that all of Pain\\'s bodies belonged to ninja he once knew, amongst them being his old student, Yahiko, functioning as Pain\\'s Deva Path. \\n\\nJiraiya mortally wounded by the Six Paths of Pain.\\nWith this information, Jiraiya was able to discover the truth, but his throat was crushed by the Asura Path, before he was stabbed by the other Six Paths of Pain. Pinned down to the ground, Jiraiya was unable to tell Fukasaku of what he had learned. As Jiraiya laid dying, he remembered a conversation he had had with Minato and Kushina about how they wanted to name their son after the character in his book, thereby making him Naruto\\'s godfather. Remembering this forced himself back to life with his own willpower, and writes a message on Fukasaku\\'s back. Thinking to himself, he decides that Naruto was the Child of the Prophecy, and that it was up to him to decide his future. The Asura Path then shot his fist at Jiraiya and Fukasaku and destroyed the slab of concrete that Jiraiya was lying on. Jiraiya then drifted off into the water to his death while thinking about what he\\'d name his next book. He then decided to name it \"The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki\" and said it had a nice ring to it. Meanwhile, Pain deduced that Jiraiya was dead, but Fukasaku had got away.\\n'},\n",

After carrying Sasuke home as he had sprained his ankle, Itachi was told by his father Fugaku to attend an Uchiha clan meeting the next day, which Itachi chose not to attend due to his Anbu priorities. The following day, he was approached by Uchiha clan members of the Konoha Military Police Force, who believed he was responsible for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, who had also missed the meeting. Itachi fought the police officers, calling the Uchiha clan arrogant and pathetic, relenting only after hearing Sasuke's voice. Shortly after, as his mother made him dinner, Itachi had slaughtered the entire clan, sparing only Sasuke's life. As Sasuke had demanded why Itachi would do such a thing, Itachi had told him that he has butchered them all simply to test the limit of his power, and wanted Sasuke to grow powerful so that he may be a worthy opponent for him one day. Before he departed, Itachi reveals to Sasuke that the secret behind the Mangekyō Sharingan is to kill your best friend, explaining that he did kill Shisui, and if Sasuke followed in his steps, he would be the third one in the clan to have activated the Mangekyō. \\n\\nItachi is awoken from his reverie as Sasuke enters the hideout. Itachi asks what Sasuke sees with his Sharingan, to which Sasuke replies that he sees Itachi dead. The two begin fighting as Sasuke attempts to strike with his Chidori Sharp Spear; Itachi uses his Early Sacrifice technique to jump on Sasuke's shoulder, evading the attack, and spins Sasuke around before slamming him into a wall. As Sasuke hits the wall, he prepares his Chidori and rushes towards Itachi. Just as Itachi expects Sasuke to thrust him with it, Sasuke disperses the lighning chakra through his Chidori Current, and uses the opportunity to leap into the air and impales Itachi with his sword.\\n\\nAs Itachi falls on the ground below, he muses that Sasuke has grown strong and disintegrates into a flock of crows. Sasuke realises that Itachi has been using a genjutsu, but it turns out that the Sasuke that was fighting is also an illusion; the real Sasuke sneaks up from behind Itachi and runs his sword through him. As Itachi coughs up blood, Sasuke demands to know who else from the Uchiha clan survived. When Itachi further questions his demand, Sasuke reminds him that he was told he would be the third to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan, meaning there was someone else out there other than Itachi who possessed it. Believing that this person aided Itachi take out the police force in the clan's massacre, Sasuke pushes the blade further through Itachi's torso as he demands to know who it is so that he may kill that person as well.

Itachi reminds Sasuke that one's reality is merely another's fantasy and that the truth is that Madara is still alive, whether he would like to believe it or not. As Sasuke has his sword impaled through Itachi's back, he tells Itachi that his Sharingan has matured to a point where Itachi's genjutsu won't work on him; Sasuke then turns around and fires a Chidori Sharp Spear at the real Itachi, who is sitting behind him, missing Itachi's face by inches. The brothers are unaware that their bout is being witnessed by Zetsu, who wonders why they haven't begun their clash already.\\n\\nItachi tells Sasuke that he would like to take the time to share a little history regarding the Uchiha clan and pulls Sasuke into a genjutsu, where Sasuke sees Madara and his younger brother Izuna sparring. Itachi explains that the two brothers always fought one another to push each to their limits and eventually killed their own comrades to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan. With the Mangekyō  granting him visual prowess, Madara became the head of the clan and waged war against numerous villages; however, the Mangekyō had a price for those who used its abilities, and Madara was rendered blind. Desperate to regain his vision once more, Madara stole his brother Izuna's eyes and fused them with his own, creating an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan that heightens the user's visual prowess and does not cause them to lose their vision. \\n\\nEventually, Madara formed an alliance with Hashirama Senju of the Senju clan, who would become the First Hokage, and fought for leadership at the Valley of the End. In a bid to gain vengeance, Itachi reveals that it was Madara who unleashed the Nine-Tailed Fox on Konoha 16 years ago, as he was able to control the tailed beast with his Eternal Mangekyō. Itachi tells Sasuke that since the Eternal Mangekyō can only be activated by taking the Sharingan eyes of a close family member, ideally a sibling, he plans to take Sasuke's eyes and reach a status higher than Madara himself ever obtained.\\n\\nRealising that his life's goal is finally in front of him, Sasuke removes his bandages as he launches a volley of shuriken at Itachi, who fires his own back. Sasuke rushes towards Itachi with his sword, who blocks it. As they remain locked in each other's grip, Itachi's shadow clone comes from above, throwing kunai towards Sasuke. Forcing a snake to burst out of his cursed seal, Sasuke uses the snake to shield himself and leap backwards. Using the Unsealing Technique, Sasuke summons a fūma shuriken and hurls it at Itachi, who blocks it with a kunai. However, Sasuke managed to imbue the fūma shuriken with his Lightning Release, running his Chidori through it; the process destroys the Itachi shadow clone.\\n\\nUsing his Mangekyō, Itachi arrives before Sasuke and kicks him into a wall, trapping his arms and feet.

Itachi, though, uses a shadow clone to bind Sasuke from behind while he approaches his brother and attempts to pull his left eye out. The entire ordeal, however, is revealed to be Tsukuyomi, a Mangekyō Sharingan genjutsu that Sasuke is able to break through, much to the shock and surprise of Itachi and Zetsu, who is discreetly observing the battle.\\n\\nWhite Zetsu wonders how Sasuke was able to break out of it with his regular Sharingan, since the Mangekyō Sharingan is touted to be stronger, and Black Zetsu claims that Sasuke's proficiency with his Sharingan exceeds Itachi's, likening it to a pebble being thrown a master taking out a shuriken thrown by a rookie. As Itachi is on his knees, reeling from the pain in his eyes, Sasuke unseals and summons two fūma shuriken, which he hurls at Itachi, hiding the second shuriken in the shadow of the first. Itachi barely manages to avoid being sliced by the two shuriken when Sasuke pulls the shuriken with wire strings, stabbing Itachi. Zetsu wonders how Itachi could have gotten hit as he should be able to dodge such an attack; Itachi is revealed to be suffering from blurry vision after having used his Tsukuyomi.

Itachi is barely able to evade it, leaping into the air, only for Sasuke to rush towards him with his Chidori in hand.\\n\\nSasuke's Chidori manages to hit the ceiling, creating a massive hole; Itachi uses the Great Fireball Technique both offensively and defensively, propelling himself out of the Chidori's range. As they both land on the rooftop, they both use the Great Fireball Technique, their flames clashing against one another. Itachi unleashes the Amaterasu ability from his right Mangekyō Sharingan to create inextinguishable black flames that smother Sasuke's orange flames and proceeds to burn Sasuke himself. Sasuke attempts to shield himself with his wing, only for the wing to burn off. As the Amaterasu attempts to consume him in flames, Sasuke reverts back to his normal state and uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to create a hole beneath him while shedding his skin to avoid being burned by Itachi's Amaterasu, having gained the ability to do so after absorbing Orochimaru.\\n\\nReactivating his cursed seal to its second stage once more, Sasuke uses the last of his chakra to use Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique, creating a dragon-head shaped fireball that bursts through the roof, narrowly missing Itachi and firing off into the clouds. As Sasuke's cursed seal recedes once more, Itachi, using his Sharingan to gauge Sasuke's chakra levels, claims that Sasuke has lost the battle. Sasuke, however, gives Itachi a smirk and asks if he would actually come to a death match unprepared, as storm clouds begin to rumble above them.

As Itachi begins to make his way towards Sasuke, who is out of chakra, the repressed portion of Orochimaru that Sasuke had absorbed begins to take over his body. Using the Eight Branches Technique, Orochimaru's eight white snakes burst out of Sasuke's cursed seal as Orochimaru himself exits from one of the snake's mouths, thanking Itachi for lowering Sasuke's chakra enough to the point where he could break free and grateful that he has another opportunity to take over Sasuke's body.\\n\\nUsing his Susanoo's Sword of Totsuka, which has the ability to seal any soul and trap it forever in a genjutsu, Itachi decapitates seven of the eight snakes and manages to seal Orochimaru away, removing Sasuke's cursed seal in the process.

Tobi tells Sasuke that Itachi did not cause the massacre single-handedly, revealing that he helped and that he is none other than Madara Uchiha. He asks Sasuke to remember the memories of his brother when he was younger, causing Sasuke to remember talking to Itachi when they were younger as to why the crest of the Konoha Military Police Force bore the insignia of their clan. Unable to process the information, Sasuke lashes out at Madara and passes out soon after.\\n\\nAs he wakes up, Sasuke finds himself bound. Madara tells Sasuke that Itachi\\'s fate is linked to the events of the Warring States Period as Itachi\\'s decision to murder their clan was in actuality a mission given to him by the higher-ups in Konoha, and that it is a tale that he believes Sasuke should know; he adds that Itachi had passed down his Amaterasu to prevent Sasuke from hearing the story. Sasuke agrees to listen, and Madara begins his tale. Back during the era of the Warring States, where many villages attacked one another in an attempt to increase their borders or military strength, two clans stood out as the most powerful clans — the Uchiha clan and the Senju Clan. The Senju clan was led by Hashirama Senju, whom Madara had fought many times. One day, after a long time of fighting, both the Uchiha clan and the Senju came to a peace treaty, with only Madara being against it. However, as leader of the clan, Madara went along with the clan\\'s wishes and together they formed Konohagakure.\\n\\nHowever, when it came time to choose the Hokage who would rule the village, Hashirama was chosen, leaving Madara incensed that he was not. He attempted to convince the Uchiha clan to protest the Senju government, but was shunned by his own clan for wanting to start another conflict; to make matters worse, the clan believed that he had killed his own younger brother and had stolen his Mangekyō Sharingan, with Madara revealing to Sasuke that his brother had given them willingly. In an attempt to get revenge on the village, Madara fought with Hashirama using the Nine-Tailed Fox at what would later become known as the Valley of the End. Many shinobi, Hashirama included, believed Madara had died during that final conflict.\\n\\nOver time, Hashirama\\'s younger brother Tobirama Senju was chosen to be the Second Hokage, and as an act of \"trust\" towards the Uchiha clan, he had delegated all of them to the police force, thus barring them from high-ranking positions within the Senju government. Some of the Uchiha clansmen began to inherit Madara\\'s will and ideology and did not like the idea of being the Senju\\'s lackeys. Nonetheless, the Uchiha clan did nothing about it until sixteen years prior, when the Nine-Tails attacked Konoha. Since the Sharingan is able to control the tailed beast, the government had placed the Uchiha clan under suspicion of the attack and had forced them to relocate on the outskirts of the village. Thus, the Uchiha clan began to plan a coup d\\'état in order to overthrow the Senju government. Madara reveals that except for the Third Hokage, the other members of the government approved the decision to keep the Uchiha clan under observation. He reveals Itachi was an Anbu tasked with spying on the Uchiha clan who was eventually ordered to exterminate them, and that the only people who knew the truth were Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado (the two advisors of the Konoha Council), Danzō Shimura of the Anbu and the Third Hokage himself.\\n'},\n",

When Itachi was four, he had witnessed the deaths of many during the Third Shinobi World War, and thus developed a pacifist nature. Sasuke and Itachi's father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the coup d'état that would have had the Uchiha clan overthrow the Senju government. \\n\\nIn order to aid in his coup, Fugaku had Itachi placed within the Anbu so he would serve as a spy for them. However, Itachi's loyalty was not towards his clan, but towards the village, and wanted to do what was best for Konohagakure. Thus, the Konoha Council and Danzō Shimura had exploited that trait and had Itachi spy on the Uchiha clan for them. When the Third Hokage was unable to come to a peaceful negotiation with the Uchiha clan, the elders decided to eliminate them. Itachi was tasked with a hard decision — allow his clan to carry out its coup, causing the destabilisation of their village, deaths of countless innocent people as well as incite neighbouring nations to invade them, potentially starting the Fourth Shinobi World War, or to exterminate his clan in order to prevent a war and the numerous casualties that would come with it.\\n\\nMadara tells Sasuke that around that time, he had infiltrated Konoha in order to have his vengeance on the village itself as well as the Uchiha clan who had shunned him. Itachi was the only person who had known he was still alive and had managed to locate him, and had proceeded to offer him a counter proposal — he would help Madara extinguish the Uchiha clan in exchange for sparing the village, which Madara had readily agreed to. However, while Itachi had managed to murder his father, his mother, and his lover, he was unable to kill his little brother, and thus had spared Sasuke's life. Following the clan's massacre, Madara and Itachi had split their ways while Itachi, reporting the mission's success to the village, had left Konoha; however, he had asked the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe from harm and threatened to leak the village's intelligence to unallied nations otherwise.\\n\\nSasuke refuses to accept Madara's story, claiming that Itachi had murdered their clan to test the limits of his abilities, that he was nothing more than a criminal who joined the Akatsuki, and that Itachi had no reason to protect him, citing that Itachi would not have used his Mangekyō Sharingan against him if he was not trying to kill him. Madara reveals to Sasuke that Itachi's goal, other than implanting the Amaterasu within Sasuke, was to seal away Orochimaru as well as Sasuke's Cursed Seal of Heaven, a feat that was only capable if he had reduced Sasuke's chakra levels to their bare minimum. Madara also divulges that following the Konoha Crush, Itachi's true motive for returning to the village was to make sure that Sasuke would be kept safe from the likes of Danzō following the Third's death, and that he was also spying on the Akatsuki from within for Konoha's sake.\\n\\nAs Madara finishes his tale, Sasuke stands on a cliff, noticing at a hawk flying around. Tears streaming down his face, he recalls the memories of his brother he had before the clan's massacre and how much he had loved and respected Itachi. He then declares that he is renaming their team from Hebi to Taka, and that their new mission is to destroy Konohagakure, awakening his own Mangekyō Sharingan in the process.\\n\"},\n",

Madara claims that with Itachi gone and Sasuke taking his place, his plans are finally coming to fruition.\\n\\nOn their sojourn to find the Eight-Tails, Sasuke uses his Mangekyō Sharingan's genjutsu to interrogate Kiyoi Yotsuki, a shinobi from Kumogakure, who reveals that the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki is a man with a tattoo on his right shoulder and numerous blades in his possession, and that he is at the Valley of Clouds and Lightning. After arriving at the valley, they find themselves face-to-face with a rapper named Killer B, who is the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails. Suigetsu attempts to attack him with his Kubikiribōchō, only for Killer B to use his strength to pry the blade away from him; Jūgo attempts to attack as well, but Killer B uses the Kubikiribōchō to defeat him. Seeing his defeated teammates, Sasuke decides to step up and handle the jinchūriki himself, claiming that he wishes to acquire the tailed beast in order to use the Akatsuki in his quest to destroy Konoha.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"With his Sword of Kusanagi in hand, Sasuke goes up against Killer B, the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails. Killer B, in possession of Suigetsu's Kubikiribōchō, attempts to strike at Sasuke, only for the latter to pin his sword into the ground to balance himself as he kicks Killer B in the neck. Sasuke manages to loosen Killer B's grip on the Kubikiribōchō and returns it to Suigetsu.\\n\\nWith the Kubikiribōchō being taken away from him, Killer B unleashes his seven swords and wields them using various parts of his body. Sasuke attempts to hit Killer B with his Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana, only for Killer B to infuse his own Lightning Release into his swords, blocking the attack. Sasuke continues to go on the offensive, using his Sharingan to keep track of the swords, but nearly misses Killer B attempting a heel kick; Sasuke avoids the kick but ends up being severely impaled by two of his swords.\\n\\nKarin tells Sasuke to bite her, her chakra healing Sasuke's near-fatal wounds, as Killer B attempts to take the opportunity to kill Sasuke; however, Suigetsu blocks the attack with his Kubikiribōchō. Killer B's Lightning Release swords begin to slice through Suigetsu's blade, but Sasuke recovers enough to use his Chidori to counter Killer B's chakra. As Karin sits out, exhausted from healing Sasuke, the others decide to attack Killer B in tandem, with Suigetsu advising that they not hold back. Killer B manages to use his Disturbance Taijutsu to land a hit on Suigetsu, grinding his fist into the other's chest, only for Suigetsu to trap Killer B's fist with his Hydrification Technique. With Killer B unable to move out of the way, Suigetsu tells Sasuke to hit them both, and Sasuke uses his Chidori on Killer B as he is wet, the water conducting the electricity and shocking both of them.\\n\\nAs Killer B lays there dazed, Jūgo attempts to hit him from above, only for Killer B to jump out of the way. The jinchūriki states that he has had enough with the battle and decides to go out for a drink. Using her Mind's Eye of the Kagura technique, Karin spots Killer B's location as Sasuke rushes towards him. Realising that his foes are troublesome, Killer B goes into his Version 1 form, growing chakra tails; Sasuke recalls when Naruto did the same during their battle. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke is able to dodge Killer B's tailed form, only for the jinchūriki to go after the other Taka members. Entering into a partial transformation, Jūgo uses his jet boosters to save himself, Karin, and Suigetsu, though the latter falls into the surrounding body of water.\\n\\nThe result of Killer B slamming into the ground causes large clouds of smoke to appear before them. Killer B attempts to rush at Sasuke, who uses his Mangekyo enhanced genjutsu on him. However, Killer B snaps out of the genjutsu instantly and uses his Lightning Release: Lariat to punch Sasuke, rupturing his neck, chest, and his organs. Killer B muses how genjutsu does not work jinchūriki who have complete control of their tailed beast since the beast's chakra could snap the host out of any genjutsu. \\n\\nAs Sasuke lays there dying, Jūgo uses his Piston Fist: Style One to punch the jinchūriki and proceeds to use his Cellular Regeneration Ejection to heal Sasuke, claiming that Sasuke would not die from it since he is compatible with the cursed seal; however, the process causes Jūgo to regress in physical age, giving him the appearance of a young child. Meanwhile, Killer B enters into a full transformation, unleashing the Eight-Tailed Ox from within. As he attempts to attacks them, Suigetsu uses the surrounding water to create a form that resembles a demon-like fish, and blocks Killer B's attack. In this form, Suigetsu is able to face the Eight-Tails head on while Sasuke, Karin and Jūgo try to flee. In order to prevent their escape, Killer B fires his Tailed Beast Ball at them, although Suigetsu's form is able to absorb all the damage himself, saving his teammates. \\n\\nShocked at the fact that Suigetsu was willing to risk his life for him and recalling how Karin and Jūgo had healed him from fatal injuries at their own expense, Sasuke is reminded of Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura. Wanting to protect his teammates, Sasuke's left Sharingan transforms into the Mangekyō and proceeds to use Amaterasu, setting the tailed beast on fire. Killer B attempts to use a tentacle to crush Karin but Sasuke uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to slice the tentacle off; however, another tentacles manages to swat Karin and she is engulfed in the black flames as well. Desperate to save Karin's life, Sasuke's left Mangekyō manages to extinguish the flames, much to his surprise. Realising he can control the flames, Sasuke puts out the Amaterasu, revealing an unconscious Killer B.\\n\\nWith his eyes bleeding from using the Mangekyō, Sasuke asks Jūgo to retrieve Karin as well as Killer B. Unbeknownst to them, they are being observed by J and K, two shinobi of Kumogakure. Noticing the Akatsuki robes as well as Sasuke's Uchiha clan crest, and remembering how Yugito Nii, another jinchūriki from their village, was killed by the Akatsuki, the two shinobi decide to report their findings to the Raikage, who happens to be Killer B's brother.\\n\\nJūgo and Sasuke begin their walk back to their hideout, carrying an unconscious Karin and Killer B, as well as Suigetsu, who has been rendered to a jelly-like state. Jūgo asks if Sasuke is okay physically, as he had lost his Cursed Seal of Heaven in his fight with Itachi and subsequently did not recover completely from said fight. Sasuke admits that he did not expect a fight of such magnitude, but states that at least they managed to succeed in their mission.\\n\"},\n",

Hotaru\\'s servant, Tonbee, tells them that there are enemies out there triggering their traps and are most likely invading Mount Katsuragi in order to get their heads on Hotaru\\'s grandfather\\'s forbidden technique. Tonbee decides to protect the fort as Utakata and Hotaru escape. Tonbee, however, manages to send word out to Konohagakure for help.\\n\\nIn her office, Tsunade is given the request by Shizune, and the former explains that long ago, En no Gyōja, the leader of the Tsuchigumo Clan, had developed a technique that was capable of destroying an entire village. The Third Hokage had then requested that En no Gyōja classify it as a kinjutsu; in return, Konoha would provide them with assistance whenever they would need it. In order to protect Naruto from the Akatsuki, Tsunade decides to send Naruto amongst the squad that is to be dispatched to Mount Katsuragi.\\n\\nAfter having failed to complete the Itachi Pursuit Mission, the Eight Man Squad make their way back home when they are stopped by Katsuyu, the personal summon of Tsunade herself. Katsuyu relays the situation at Mount Katsuragi to Kakashi, who decides to send Team 7, under Yamato\\'s command, to deal with the crisis. Meanwhile, the four bandits manage to shatter the barrier and infiltrate the fort, only to find Tonbee and no forbidden scroll. They attack the old man, who does not divulge any information. Of one of the bandits, Akaboshi, manages to deduce that En no Gyōja\\'s granddaughter must possess the scroll with the kinjutsu and decides that they should leave, as he senses Team 7\\'s impending arrival.\\n\\nAs they get there, Sai finds the hidden path that Hotaru and Utakata had used to escape. Yamato orders Sakura to stay with Tonbee and heal him while the other three follow the hidden path. On the path, Hotaru asks Utakata to teach her more techniques, with Utakata stating that he has taught her nothing. She asks whether he remembers the first time he met and he had saved her life, using his Soap Bubble Ninjutsu to kill enemy shinobi who were after her. Utakata reveals that they were after him, as he is a wanted man, and that he was only saving himself; his only reason for coming with her to their fort was to throw off his trail. Hotaru does not care, and cries for her \"master\" to train her. Angered at being called master, Utakata lashes out, only for Naruto to interfere. Using his shadow clones, Naruto attempts to defeat Utakata, who uses his Drowning Bubble Technique to take out the shadow clones. However, Hotaru tells Naruto that Utakata is her protector, not her enemy.\\n\\nAs Yamato and Sai catch up, Naruto apologises for attacking him. Utakata, however, tells him that he is leaving Hotaru under Team 7\\'s care and begins to walk away. Hotaru runs up to her, pleading for him to stay, but he merely creates a bubble and drifts away.\\n'},\n",

However, he advises them not to engage in combat with the Konoha shinobi team dispatched to provide assistance, claiming that once they reached the Tsuchigumo Clan\\'s village, they would depart, allowing the bandits to swoop in and retrieve the kinjutsu.\\n\\nElsewhere, Utakata sits against a tree, blowing bubbles. He remembers when he first met Hotaru, and how she begged him to be her master. Having been irritated at the word \"master\" (due to his own master abusing him), he refused; Hotaru, however, reminded him that he was getting free food and a room and that he should pay them back by teaching her. He told her that he would consider it if she is able to walk on water. When Hotaru failed, Utakata claimed that he cannot teach anyone ninjutsu if they cannot manage to walk on the surface of water. Nevertheless, Hotaru practised all night and come morning, she mastered the technique. Wanting to get her off his back, Utakata showed her the Water Release: Wild Water Wave technique, and told her to master that before being his student. As she failed to perform the technique, Utakata smiled as he mused that only one who possesses Water Release could use the jutsu. Yet, by the next morning, Hotaru managed to master the Wild Water Wave technique as well.\\n\\nUtakata is snapped out of his reverie when he notices four shadows flitting through the trees. He attacks them with his bubbles, claiming that he was from Mount Katsuragi, the fort they had attacked, and that he is interested in getting his hands on the forbidden technique as well. He uses his bubble clones to deceive them while also blinding one of them, although he is caught in the middle of an exploding barrier.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hotaru attempts to brush off Naruto, who is following her through the woods. She tells him to leave, as she can handle herself. Yamato gives Sai an idea, and Sai creates an ink leech that falls on Hotaru. Panicking, she cries out for Naruto to help her, and asks him to come with her until the forest clears out, being afraid of leeches. As they walk, with Naruto constantly swatting away the leeches, Hotaru talks about how she had viewed Utakata as his master. Naruto tells her about his own master, who is a pervert, but states that Jiraiya is strong and kind-hearted and that he would not mind becoming like him some day. The team eventually reaches the village, where they leave Hotaru at the hands of the Tsuchigumo Chief, who is Hotaru\\'s uncle. Naruto notices all the villagers glaring at her, but leaves along with Yamato and Sai. However, he finds himself riddles with uncertainty and rushes back to the village alone to ensure her safety.\\n'},\n",

She asks her uncle, the Tsuchigumo Chief, if she should have returned, and he assures her fears that it is alright as the village is her room. He leaders her to a small room, telling her to stay in there. However, she is soon ambushed by the four bandits. To make matters worse, her uncle overhears the ordeal as he bars the door to her room, ignoring her cries for help and preventing her from escaping.\\n\\nOne of the members, Nangō, manages to restrain her and steal the forbidden scroll from her pack, although it explodes when it is opened. As the explosion destroys the house, Hotaru flees. The four bandits manage to catch up to her in the woods, but she is saved by the arrival of Utakata, who takes her and leaves the area. Before they can pursue him, their leader Shiranami, who has the Tsuchigomo clan crest on his back, notifies them that Utakata is wanted by Kirigakure and that he has a bounty of 50 million ryo. \\n\\nNaruto heads to the Tsuchigomo clan's village, where he finds out that Hotaru was attacked and that she had fled. However, he is immensely angered when he finds out that her uncle and the villagers are aware that she may be injured and did not bother to look for her, having no regard for her welfare. Yamato and Sai also arrive, and the captain reminds Naruto that Hotaru's safety is their priority, not the villagers' actions. Attempting to track Hotaru, Sai asks Yamato why they must find her since their mission was to just escort her to the village. Yamato explains that since the mission is based on a secret treaty signed by En no Gyōja and the Third Hokage, in the event that her village is unable to protect her, they must step up and do so. Sai then uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to create small ink mice to find Hotaru.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Utakata uses his Water Release: Bubbles Technique — Drift to carry himself and Hotaru to safety. When asked why he had saved her, he attempts to bluff and claims that he is after the forbidden jutsu as well, although she is able to see through his lies. He asks why she does not give the kinjutsu up to save her life, and learns that her grandfather was her original master and that she wishes to honour his wishes to protect the technique and restore the Tsuchigomo clan. Utakata, having been assaulted by his own master, cannot understand the student-master bond that Hotaru feels. Hotaru proceeds to remove her top, and Utakata becomes embarrassed to see her breasts. However, she turns around to reveal her bare back to him, prompting Utakata to wonder how someone could have done something like that to her. Covering up, she tells him that she did not want to keep any secrets from him since he is to be her master. Angered by the use of the word 'master', Utakata decides to leave her, unaware that he is being watched by a Kiri hunter-nin.\\n\\nThe hunter-nin uses his Secret Technique: Mist Rain to render Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu useless and proceeds to use his Water Release: Water Whip to take Hotaru hostage. The hunter-nin asks Utakata to surrender himself lest he allow Hotaru to die on his behalf; he accepts, although he is restrained by the Water Whip technique performed by two other hunter-nin. As Hotaru pleads with them to let Utakata go, the hunter-nin holding her hostage tells her that he is a wanted criminal who had killed his master and fled the village.

Back at Mount Katsuragi, Naruto pressures Tonbee and asks how he could have allowed En no Gyōja to have sealed the Tsuchigumo clan's forbidden technique within his own granddaughter. However, Hotaru reveals that she had specifically asked for it, since it was her grandfather's wishes to use the kinjutsu to restore the clan to its former glory and that a student must obey his or her master's wishes. Utakata shuns her for her opinion, remembering being strapped down and attacked by his own master, Harusame. Tonbee decides that for the sake of the clan and for Hotaru's safety, he will remove the seal from her back, thus rendering the forbidden technique useless; he adds that En no Gyōja would never have sealed the kinjutsu on her back if there was no way to undo it, prompting that no master would do such a thing.

Having noticed Madara\\'s unresponsive manner, Sasuke reminded the Uchiha that while the former may write him off as an emotional brat, he does not care for anyone who thinks of him in a different manner and that his love for Itachi and the subsequent inconsolable grief that came after his death would cause him to assassinate anybody who stood in his way. Meanwhile in Kumogakure, J tells the Raikage that his brother Killer B has been abducted by an Akatsuki member who is an Uchiha from Konoha.\\n\\nBack in the village, Naruto is awoken by Kakashi, who tells him that Tsunade has summoned him. On the way to the Hokage\\'s office, Naruto spots Gamabunta and Gamakichi, wondering why the two toads are there and why Kakashi is being silent. Inside Tsunade\\'s office, Naruto is greeted by Fukasaku, one of the Two Great Sage Toads and Jiraiya\\'s very own master. Naruto is insulted when Fukasaku refers to Jiraiya as a \"boy\" while the toad is amused that Naruto refers to Jiraiya as a pervy sage. Fukasaku, however, reveals to Naruto that Jiraiya has died during his battle with Pain. Naruto is heartbroken and unable to form a response as Kakashi wonders how Jiraiya had died. Fukasaku reveals to them that Jiraiya had found out that Pain, the leader of the Akatsuki, was operating out Amegakure and had decided to infiltrate the village to confront him. Upon meeting Pain, Jiraiya found out that Pain was actually his former student Nagato. Kakashi and Shizune are shocked when Fugasaku adds that Pain, along with five others, possess the Rinnegan. Kakashi is unable to believe that there are six Rinnegan wielders in the world while Shizune reveals that it was thought to be a mythical dojutsu once wielded by the Sage of Six Paths. Removing his robe, Fukasaku shows them the code Jiraiya had engraved onto his back.\\n\\nNaruto decides to blame Tsunade for Jiraiya\\'s death, telling her that she shouldn\\'t have sent him on such a dangerous mission. As he leaves, he tells Tsunade that had Jiraiya been the Fifth Hokage, he would never have sent her on the same mission. Kakashi attempts to apologise to Fukasaku for Naruto\\'s behaviour, but the sage toad tells Kakashi that he can see that Naruto cared for and loved Jiraiya, and that he believes, more than anything after seeing how much Jiraiya meant to him, that Naruto is the Child of the Prophecy. As he walks home, Naruto recalls certain memories involving Jiraiya — when he first summoned Gamabunta, when Jiraiya had asked him to accompany him on his search for Tsunade, and how Jiraiya had told him that Naruto reminded him of the Fourth Hokage. As he remembers Jiraiya giving him a popsicle stick, Naruto notices the leaves in the air and stares up at the sky, saddened.\\n'},\n",

He reveals that before Jiraiya died, he managed to capture one of the Ame-nin, and that Jiraiya also managed to kill one of Pain's six bodies, which Fukasaku has in his possession. After giving the corpse to Tsunade, the Hokage orders Shizune to prep an autopsy unit. Fukasaku also has a picture of his back taken, asking the Hokage to decipher the clue and notify him, as well as to notify Naruto that he can always be reached at Mount Myōboku.\\n\\nOn his walk home, Naruto smiles as he sees an Icha Icha poster and remembers how Jiraiya would always peek at nude women, citing it as research for his books, and remembers his his first journey with Jiraiya.

At home, Naruto begins to cry and decides to take a walk late at night. After buying a popsicle, he sits down on a bench and allows the tears to stream from his face. Iruka walks up to him and consoles him as Naruto expresses how one of his wishes was to have Jiraiya witness his ascension to Hokage and how Jiraiya only knew the clueless Naruto during his time alive. Iruka reminds Naruto that he is a disciple of the Sannin and that Jiraiya always spoke highly of him, having considered him as a grandson, and that Naruto should continue to be the shinobi that he was so proud of. Iruka breaks the popsicle in two, taking one, akin to what Jiraiya used to do.\\n\\nAfter Mitoku and Shiho of the Konoha Cryptanalysis Team notify Shikamaru that Jiraiya's code could only be broken by those closest to him, Shikamaru asks Tsunade and Kakashi, who cannot decipher it. Shikamaru then heads to Naruto's house, only to find the genin depressed. In order to snap him out of his funk, Shikamaru brings Naruto to the hospital to meet a pregnant Kurenai, and reveals that Asuma had entrusted him to be their child's teacher. He reminds Naruto that he knows what it feels like to have a teacher killed but that instead of crying about it, they should move on, and evolve from students to teachers, honouring the teachers they had themselves. Recalling a happy image of Jiraiya, Naruto smiles, and Shikamaru gives him Jiraiya's code to decipher.\\n\"},\n",

Pain notices that Naruto has mastered Sage Mode, just like their master Jiraiya. Naruto is shocked that Pain was Jiraiya\\'s pupil; Pain declares that as \"student siblings\", should have the same vision towards peace, involving Naruto sacrificing his life and handing over the Nine-Tails for that cause. Naruto angrily rejects Pain\\'s ideology, asking if Pain considers his destruction of Konoha as peaceful, and proceeds to form his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. The Hyūga shinobi relays to Sakura that Naruto has formed a chakra shuriken, which Sakura realises is the double-edged Rasenshuriken; however, instead of thrusting the Rasenshuriken physically, Naruto throws it at the four remaining Paths.\\n'},\n",

However, Naruto expands the Rasenshuriken at the last moment, and the attack destroys Pain's Human Path. Shortly after, Pain notices that Naruto's senjutsu is beginning to wane. Knowing that Naruto cannot fight the remaining four due to all four sharing the same Rinnegan vision, Shima creates a dust cloud to obscure Pain's vision; Fukasaku uses his senjutsu to hurl Gamabunta in Naruto's direction, and the giant toad swallows both Naruto and Pain's Animal Path. With the other Paths unable to see through the dust cloud and the Animal Path unable to see inside Gamabunta's mouth, Naruto uses his remaining senjutsu to form his Spiralling Serial Spheres and rams it at the Animal Path, destroying it. Gamabunta then regurgitates the destroyed Path as well as Naruto, whose Sage Mode is deactivated as he has run out of natural energy. \\n\\nThe Deva Path begins to attack Naruto, believing it to be an easy fight now that Naruto is not in Sage Mode. Naruto tosses his scroll to Fukasaku, who summons a Naruto shadow clone that was gathering natural energy back at Mount Myōboku. Naruto then dispels the clone and absorbs the clone's gathered senjutsu, reverting back to his Sage Mode and resuming his fight against Pain. Fukasaku explains to Shima that since they could not fuse with him due to the Nine-Tails rejecting them, Naruto had come up with that creative, ingenious solution to circumvent Sage Mode's five minute duration. Naruto forms another Rasenshuriken and hurls it towards the Deva Path, since Katsuyu reveals to Naruto that he is unable to use any techniques at the moment. However, the technique is absorbed by Preta Path. Naruto wonders how the Preta Path is able to move, since he knocked it out with his Frog Kata, and realises that Pain's Outer Path is able to reanimate the bodies using its King of Hell technique. Knowing that his victory rests on destroying the Outer Path, Naruto forms a strategy.\\n\\nNaruto creates two shadow clones and has them form a Rasengan in each of his hands, and then has the clones drop a pellet of red smoke. One of his shadow clones then transforms into the Rasenshuriken as the other clone throws it in the Deva Path's direction, knowing that the Preta Path would catch it and attempt to absorb it. The fake Rasenshuriken promptly reverts back to its shadow clone form just before the Preta Path can catch it, and since that Path's weakness is physical attacks, the Path is easily subdued. Naruto then throws the real Rasenshuriken through the red smoke towards the Deva Path, who does not have anyone guarding his front anymore. However, Pain has regained his abilities and proceeds to use his Shinra Tensei to repel and dissipate the attack. In spite of that, the real Naruto, who had jumped into the air through the guise of the smoke, lands on the Outer Path, using his Spiralling Serial Spheres to destroy it, surprising Gamabunta, Fukasaku and Shima. The Naruto that attacked the Preta Path prepares to kill it, only for Pain, whose five second interval has passed, to use Shinra Tensei again to repel both Naruto and his shadow clone, as well as Gamabunta, Gamahiro and Gamaken. With the three giant toads defeated, Naruto is left to fight the two remaining Paths alone.\\n\"},\n",

Realising that not being able to move is a good thing, Naruto takes the opportunity to stand still and gather natural energy, which the Preta Path acquires. However, the Path consumes too much and turns into a frog statue, effectively being destroyed.\\n\\nIrritated yet surprised that he has been pushed this far, the Deva Path uses Banshō Ten\\'in to pull in Fukasaku and kills him; Naruto, trying to catch the toad, falls to the ground as Pain stabs his hands with his black pole, pinning Naruto. Having trapped the jinchūriki, Pain tells him that the world shall finally know true pain, after which peace shall be created. Naruto calls Pain a hypocrite for preaching about peace after killing Jiraiya and Kakashi while also destroying Konohagakure. Pain explains that he and Naruto are fighting for the very same peace that Jiraiya wanted, and that he is merely having his vengeance on Konoha for what they did to Amegakure during the Second Shinobi World War, in which Ame was treated as a battleground by the Lands of Fire, Wind and Water. Pain states that he lost his family and friends due to the shinobi cycle of hatred and thus understands the pain Naruto must be feeling, and asks Naruto what approach he would take to ensure peace. Naruto recalls Jiraiya bestowing to him his wish to break the cycle of hatred and bring about peace, and responds that he does not have an answer. \\n\\nPain divulges that by acquiring the Nine-Tailed Fox, he would soon have the power of all nine tailed beasts, after which he would be able to use their power to destroy entire nations. After such destruction, the world would be frightened and inspired by that very fear to not cause wars and thus peace would be stabilised. As the years pass, eventually the fear would dissipate, after which humans would no doubt use the tailed beasts against one another, once again causing massive destruction that would spur fear and quell conflict. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Shikamaru decides that they should find the real Pain as to not let Shizune\\'s death to have been in vain, claiming that they will glean whatever they can from everyone, including dead bodies. Inoichi recalls the memory he had glimpsed inside Yūdachi\\'s mind and remembers that Pain lives in a high tower.

In his tower, a crippled and ill Nagato is revealed to be the true \"Pain\", speaking to Naruto via his Deva Path.

As Inoichi asks why Shikaku would do that, Shikaku reveals that his son Shikamaru had mentioned before how Naruto had a way of convincing others to follow in his path and that he would be an important shinobi for Konoha someday.

Nagato asks Naruto if he hates him, and thinking back upon how Nagato killed Jiraiya and Kakashi, Naruto lunges at Nagato with the intent to kill. As Konan moves in to shield Nagato, Naruto remembers Jiraiya's remarks on how he had hoped to break the cycle of hatred as well as how his father, the Fourth Hokage, had said the current system of hatred would only give birth to those like Pain. Naruto stops his attack and dispels both the Nine-Tails' influence as well as Sage Mode, asking for them to share their stories.

Nagato is shocked at Naruto's words, recalling when he uttered those same words to Jiraiya, who was suffering from writer's block at the time. Pulling out Jiraiya's novel, The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi, Naruto explains that he plucked his words from the book itself, and that the protagonist's dialogue was exactly what Nagato had said to Jiraiya then.

Yamato, who had been alerted that Naruto had entered into his eight-tailed form, rushes to the village and stares at its destruction. However, Shikaku tells him that it was Pain who had destroyed the village, and that Naruto single-handedly defeated him. Yamato is shocked that Naruto was able to do so, and is even more surprised when Shikaku tells him that Naruto was able to control his transformation on his own.

At that moment, Suigetsu show up through the door wielding his Kubikiribōchō, revealing that he had travelled all the way back to the Valley of Clouds and Lightning just to retrieve it. With Suigetsu's return, Sasuke mobilises Taka and notifies them that they are to head to Konoha right away. Meanwhile, Zetsu notifies Kisame and Tobi that Pain has been killed and that Konan has left as well.

During the final rounds of the Chūnin Exams, Sunagakure and Otogakure teamed up in an effort to destroy Konohagakure. Neji was told by his grandfather that two Kumo Spectators decided to take advantage of the chaos by using the opportunity to kidnap Hinata, all in a bid to acquire the Byakugan. Tenten and Kiba joined Neji as well, Kiba not trusting Neji to actually save Hinata since Neji was known for looking down on her.\\n\\nAfter triggering a trap that produced mud wolves, Tenten stayed back to deal with them while Neji and Kiba went ahead. After locating Hinata and the Kumo shinobi, Kiba and Akamaru used their Passing Fang to interfere; Kiba picked up Hinata and dropped a Smoke Bomb before disappearing. As the Kumo shinobi chased Kiba and Hinata, Kiba turned around and used Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on one of them, knocking him out. Kiba was actually Neji, who had used the Transformation Technique. Sekiei, the remaining Kumo-nin, used his Earth Release: Earth Flow Wave to avoid being struck by Neji's Gentle Fist and attempted to finish him off with his Violent Heavenly Earth Needle technique; however, his attack was blocked by Hiashi's Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. \\n\\nHiashi told Neji that he had left the village despite what was going on because both Hinata and Neji were precious to him. Team Ebisu is surprised to hear the story, unaware that such a crisis had happened during the Konoha Crush. Neji divulges that sometime after, the two Kumo-nin were apprehended and the situation was dealt internally with Kumogakure to avoid a conflict. The three genin pester Neji to explain what Naruto had to do with the story, and Neji tells them that if Naruto hadn't changed his perspective on life and destiny during their fight, then he may not have agreed to go save Hinata. However, they are unsatisfied with the story and Neji tells them to go ask somebody else for a story about Naruto.\\n\"},\n",

He then thinks back to how he met the man in the photo. He remembers a time when he found a tag with the name Kisuke written on it. When Naruto is sitting in his bed, he sees a man sitting on the other side, and after realising he is a \"ghost\", he starts screaming. Naruto asks him who he is, but the man does not remember. After seeing a tulip in Konoha, he suddenly remembers who he is and how he became to be a ghost. He was an Anbu operative investigating infiltration of spies into Konoha. His main suspect was Sabiru. After following him around, he was discovered, and the two clashed. The battle ended with Sabiru sealing away Kisuke\\'s soul and Kisuke\\'s body being left in a river. Naruto (disguised as Kisuke) breaks into a meeting involving Konoha\\'s security system and accuses Sabiru of being a spy. When Sabiru says that the real Kisuke is dead, Naruto escapes with Kakashi and Sabiru in pursuit. At some point in the chase, Kakashi caught Naruto, and gave Naruto a chance to prove Sabiru guilty of the murders of Kisuke and his wife. When Sabiru confessed to Naruto that he did kill the two, Kakashi appeared, ready to arrest him, but was promptly taken out by a hidden Kabuto Yakushi. At the end of the day, Kisuke\\'s soul is ready to depart and says goodbye to Naruto. In the present, Naruto places a bouquet of tulips on the gravestone of Kisuke, just as he promised him he would do whenever he remembers him.\\n'},\n",

As Naruto and Sasuke retrieve the statue, Sakura gets taken hostage. At first, Sasuke insists on continuing the mission, but Naruto reminds him that Kakashi said those who abandon their friends are worse than scum. When they finally find Sakura and the bandits, it was at first hard for them because their hands were stuck together. However, the two learned how to fight as a team and they quickly defeated the bandits and their leader, Jako. Although their mission was a success, the statue itself was very damaged, though Kakashi suggested that it could be melted down and re-casted.

Recalling how Naruto summoned Gamabunta during his fight with Gaara, Sasuke was frustrated at Naruto\\'s spike in strength. After destroying a tree with his Chidori, he noticed a small girl named Naho who was about to fall off a cliff towards her death and promptly saved her. Because Sasuke did not know that she was a relative of the Fire Daimyō, he did not treat her with the respect she was used to, causing her to become infatuated with him.\\n\\nNaho was later sent to Konoha where Tsunade appointed Naruto and Sakura as her bodyguards while Sasuke and Kakashi were on a mission of their own. Because Naho explicitly wanted Sasuke, Naruto used the Transformation Technique to disguise himself as Sasuke. The trio were soon ambushed by a bandit named Sadai, who wanted to kidnap Naho for money. Using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, Naruto attempted to dazzle Naho by using his \"Sasuke Punch\" and \"Sasuke Kick\" to take out the bandits and tried to defeat Sadai with his Naruto Uzumaki Combo, which he refined into the Lion Combo since he was impersonating Sasuke. However, Sadai was unfazed by the attack, prompting Naruto to strike him with Rasengan, only to be shocked that it did not work as well.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sasuke and Kakashi discovered that their mission, which was to apprehend wanted criminals in the Land of Fire, were planning to kidnap a girl named Naho, whom Sasuke recognised. As Sadai defeated Naruto, the transformation technique dispelled and Naho was shocked to see that it was not Sasuke. As she cried for Sasuke, the latter arrived. Sadai noticed his Sharingan and mused how he had met Itachi and how he had thought that Itachi had killed the entire Uchiha clan, and theorised that Sasuke must not have been worth killing. Incensed due to the fact that Itachi had said those same words, Sasuke destroyed Sadai\\'s armour with his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique and struck him in mid-air with his Chidori. As Naho watched in horror, Sasuke began to beat the man to inches of his life, with Sadai\\'s blood splattered on Sasuke\\'s face. Sadai was saved by the arrival of Kakashi, and Sasuke decided to return to Konoha. Naho became scared of Sasuke; however, she was comforted by Naruto, who told her that Sasuke was going through some problems and that he was usually a nice guy, and that he would take her to meet him once he calmed down.\\n'},\n",

Anko asks what happened, due to the fact that Yamato had left abruptly and stated it was an emergency. Tokuma reveals that the Akatsuki mounted an attack on the village and that it was destroyed, and that due to Tsunade's coma, Danzō had been appointed Hokage.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Team Samui make their way to Konoha, surprised at its destruction. Samui takes the Fourth Raikage's letter to Tsunade, only to discover that Tsunade is in a coma. She demands to see the acting Hokage, and Danzō enters the tent and proclaim himself as the village's Sixth Hokage. The letter requests that the village take action on missing-nin Sasuke Uchiha and to hand over all intel gathered on him.

However, the Raikage merely dictates that shinobi should be powerful and headstrong, instead of bowing their head and begging. Stating that the Akatsuki are criminals that deserve to be hunted, the Raikage and his squad continue on the way to the Five Kage Summit.\\n\\nOnce all five Kage convene at the Land of Iron, they begin their discourse, where the Raikage declares that he does not trust any of the other Kage because they have used the Akatsuki as mercenaries in the past, shocking Gaara. He explains to Gaara that while Orochimaru may not have been a member during the Konoha Crush, he did kill both the Third Hokage and the Fourth Kazekage, and that Iwagakure and Kirigakure have often enlisted the Akatsuki's services, with rumours swirling that Kiri is home to the Akatsuki. The Third Tsuchikage explains that in a time of disarmament where suspicious between shinobi nations still persist, it is cheaper and much more effective to hire the Akatsuki to fight for them and that he had no regrets or qualms about it, while the Fifth Mizukage reveals that Yagura Karatachi, the Fourth Mizukage, had actually been controlled by a member of the Akatsuki.\\n\\nGaara discloses to the other leaders that he was once a jinchūriki, and that the former Fifth Hokage of Konoha was the only one to provide any assistance. The Third Tsuchikage justifies their lack of involvement by citing that the abduction of jinchūriki is an embarrassing matter that should be dealt privately and internally, and that despite the Akatsuki's collection of tailed beasts, not even the jinchūriki can fully control them, citing Gaara as an example. However, Danzō divulges that there have been people who have managed to gain full control over the tailed beasts, namely Hashirama Senju, Madara Uchiha, Yagura, the former Mizukage, and Killer B, the Raikage's brother. To the utter shock of the other leaders, he reveals that Madara himself is the leader of the Akatsuki. \\n\\nWith Madara being announced as the leader, the other Kage realise the seriousness of the situation and the action that must follow.

The Fourth Raikage demands to know why Danzō was chosen and not him, since Kumogakure has yet to produce any shinobi that are members of the Akatsuki. Mifune, the general of the Land of Iron, explains that the Raikage is unsuitable for leadership due to giving in to his emotions often. Gaara is too young to assume leadership of five allied nations despite the title of Kazekage; adversely, the Third Tsuchikage is too old, and he is also not an ideal candidate due to the fact that he has employed the services of the Akatsuki numerous times in the past. Since the Akatsuki is rumoured to have been conceived in Kirigakure, the Fifth Mizukage is not qualified to lead without possible suspicions arising, thus leaving Danzō, the Sixth Hokage, to be the favorable choice.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ino begins to cry after hearing about the execution order placed on Sasuke. Shikamaru, assuming command of the remaining members of the Konoha 11, goes to Sakura's tent to talk to her when he hears the conversation occurring inside. Sai approaches Sakura and asks her how she and Naruto can fight for Sasuke so much when he does nothing but cause them pain, and that despite his lack of understanding over emotions, he feels anger over their pain. He asks Sakura what promise Naruto made to her, prompting Sakura to gasp and remember the promise Naruto made to her about bringing Sasuke back no matter what, even when he had failed. Sai reveals that Naruto is in love with her, and Sakura realises that she has been causing Naruto the same pain that Sasuke had been causing her. Shikamaru enters the tent and explains that he and the others would be heading out to eliminate Sasuke and would like Team 7's approval, citing that failing to do so would start a war between Kumogakure and Konohagakure. After he warns Sakura that he would need to complete this mission with or without her blessing, Shikamaru is aghast to discover that Naruto has already gone to the Land of Iron to meet the Raikage.

Madara tells them that what he has told them is true and that while he did consider Sasuke returning to Konoha to carry out Itachi's will, Sasuke has decided to wreak vengeance upon the village. Naruto blames Madara for manipulating Sasuke, but Madara replies that Sasuke made his decision under his own volition and that Sasuke, like him, possesses the Curse of Hatred.\\n\\nHe explains that the Sage of Six Paths, who possessed the Rinnegan, had two sons. The elder son believed that peace would come only through power and strength whereas the younger son believed that peace would be achieved through love. On his deathbed, the Sage chose his younger son as his successor, infuriating the eldest son; the two brothers eventually clashed. As time passed, their descendants also fought, the elder son's descendants being the Uchiha clan and the younger son's descendants being the Senju clan.

Sasuke's Chidori manages to make contact with the Fourth's torso, despite the latter being cloaked in his Lightning Release Chakra Mode. The Raikage praises Sasuke, telling him that he is impressed and that Sasuke's technique is similar to Kakashi's. He then proceeds to use his esteemed taijutsu and attacks Sasuke with his Liger Bomb, a technique that no one has supposedly survived. Darui manages to impale Suigetsu, whose Hydrification Technique is affected by the Lightning Release running through the blade. Darui goes on to help C to his feet as they observe in shock as Sasuke survives the strike.\\n\\nSasuke is revealed to have formed a partial Susanoo to shield him from the Liger Bomb, although the ribs of the Susanoo have been snapped. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke attempts to burn the Raikage with his Amaterasu, only to burn the samurai standing behind him. The Raikage rushes towards Sasuke in order to attack him through the Susanoo, but Sasuke uses his left eye to manipulate the black flames to shield the Susanoo, causing the Raikage's left arm to burn. Despite the flames, the Raikage decides to finish off the exhausted Sasuke with his Guillotine Drop, while the latter shields himself with his Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi, shaping the black flames to protect him.\\n\\nAs the battle is stopped abruptly by Gaara, who uses his sand to negate both Sasuke and the Raikage's attacks, C notices that Sasuke's proficiency with the Amaterasu surpasses Itachi's, while also realising the trick behind Sasuke's eyes. The Raikage cuts off his burned left arm and has C heal it while Temari and Kankurō remove the Amaterasu-ridden samurai armour off the soldier. Gaara attempts to convince Sasuke to shed the darkness and return to the light; with his eyes bleeding from using the Mangekyō, Sasuke merely states that what he wants exists only in darkness. Having no choice but to eliminate him, the Three Sand Siblings, along with Darui, decide to finish the job. Darui fires his Storm Release: Laser Circus while Kankurō, revealed to have obtained the Sasori puppet, unleashes his Red Secret Technique: Machinery Triangles; Temari employs her Wind Release: Great Sickle Weasel Technique as Gaara tops it off with his Successive Shots Sand Drizzle.

Using his Susanoo, he saves himself and Karin, whom he only spared so that she could lead him to Danzō. Gaara shields himself, his siblings and Darui while the Fourth Raikage uses his massive strength to punch his way out of the rubble. Suigetsu and Jūgo survive as well, with the latter using his Cellular Regeneration Absorption to escape from the brink of death. Karin leads Sasuke to the conference room, where Sasuke is engaged in combat with Mifune. During the struggle, Danzō, Fū and Torune escape. \\n\\nThe Fifth Mizukage uses her Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique and repels Sasuke along with his Susanoo out of the room. She reveals that she possesses two kekkei genkai — Lava Release and Boil Release. Using her Boil Release: Skilled Mist Technique to create corrosive acid, she dissolves the chakra surrounding Sasuke's Susanoo and prepares to kill him, as the latter does not have any chakra left to defend himself. However, she is suddenly restrained by White Zetsu's Spore Technique. Using the spores, White Zetsu absorbs some chakra from the Fifth Mizukage, the Third Tsuchikage, Chōjūrō and Akatsuchi, passing them on to Sasuke. As Sasuke storms into the kage conference room, he is trapped by the Tsuchikage's Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique, which seemingly incinerates him into mere particles. The Tsuchikage smirks and tells Karin that she is next while the Raikage, who had just stormed into the room, berates him for stealing his kill. At that moment, Tobi warps into the room carrying the unconscious Sasuke, announcing himself as Madara Uchiha and asks them if they would like to hear about his Eye of the Moon Plan.\\n\"},\n",

The beasts were created centuries ago when the Sage of the Six Paths split up the immense power of the Ten-Tails.

Gaara and the Fifth Mizukage do not protest the decision, and shortly after, the Third Tsuchikage decides to acquiesce. They decide to tell their respective daimyō about the Fourth Shinobi World War that has been launched as well as the news regarding their alliance. Gaara heads out to find Naruto and Kakashi, whom A tells him are still in the Land of Iron, while A himself leaves with C and Darui to find his brother, Killer B. Kurotsuchi secretly suggests that Iwagakure kill B and Naruto, in order to remove two essential pieces from Madara's plan, while crippling the military power of Konoha and Kumo simultaneously. However, to her surprise, the Tsuchikage tells her that Gaara had reminded him of who he used to be and thus he does not wish to resort to sneaky, conniving tactics and instead intends to cooperate with the other nations.\\n\\nElsewhere, Sakura professes her love for Naruto, shocking Yamato and Lee. She tells Naruto that she has grown to love him and has given up on Sasuke, who is nothing but a mere criminal who has joined the Akatsuki. Recalling how Sakura had told him that she was desperate for Sasuke's love, how she cried when she thought Sasuke was dead, and how she tearfully asked him to bring Sasuke back home, Naruto realises that Sakura is lying to him and admonishes her for her sense of humour. Sakura attempts to convince him that she truly does love him, citing that she, along with the villagers, stopped viewing him as a mischievous annoyance when he became their hero after defeating Pain. Naruto hisses that he hates people who lie to themselves and forcefully tells her to stop. Irritated, Sakura states that he cannot tell her how she feels and that he does not need to honour the promise between them anymore and that he should give up on Sasuke. Naruto attempts to tell them the truth behind Itachi to justify Sasuke's actions, but is stopped by Kakashi. Naruto merely states that he understands Sasuke's pain now and that he is making it his personal ambition to save his friend. Defeated, Sakura walks away, ordering Kiba, Sai and Lee to follow her back to the village; however, once of earshot, she asks Kiba to track Sasuke down for her. Unbeknownst to Sakura, Sai creates an ink clone that he leaves behind with Naruto, Yamato, and Kakashi.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Killer B attempts to train in enka with Sabu, but their session is crashed by Kisame, who had been sent to retrieve the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki. B infuses his Lightning Release chakra into his pencil as well as his Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords, but Kisame's sword Samehada devours the chakra, rendering the attacks useless. Transforming into his four-tailed form, B headbutts Kisame, but the latter is unaffected by it.\\n\"},\n",

Danzō orders Fū to retrieve Ao\\'s Byakugan at all costs. Using his Mind Puppet Switch Cursed Seal Technique, Fū transfers his consciousness into a puppet he leaves lying in a tree, which he rigs to attack Ao in order to use it as a medium to perform his Mind Body Switch Technique on the Kiri-nin. With Ao\\'s consciousness confined to the puppet, Fū attempts to extract the Byakugan with a kunai, but Ao\\'s talisman earrings form a barrier around the eye. Ao tells Fū that only he and certain Kiri-nin can undo the barrier seal. Undeterred, Fū decides to decapitate \"himself\" on the blade of the sword, cancelling his Mind Body Switch technique at the last second, as his original body is given the same injuries as his host body.\\n\\nAs he jumps off a tree and prepares to slice Ao\\'s head off, he is saved by the Fifth Mizukage. \"Ao\" tells her that he was under the enemy\\'s Mind Body Switch technique and apologises for being careless. The Mizukage offers to undo the barrier seal, and \"Ao\" thanks her. At that moment, the Mizukage tightens the ropes on Ao\\'s hands and tells Chōjūrō to hand her his Hiramekarei. She reveals that she knows Ao is still under the technique, as he would have never apologised in front of Chōjūrō along with the fact that Ao is aware that she was incapable of removing the seal around his eye. Fū insults her and dispels the technique causing the enraged Mizukage to attack the actual Ao. Back in his original body, which is being carried by Torune, Fū seeks Danzō\\'s forgiveness for failing his mission.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Killer B is engaged in combat with Kisame. Killer B goes into his Version 1 seven-tailed form and rushes towards Kisame, but the latter merely uses his Samehada to devour the tailed beast chakra, causing B to lose six of his tails. The Eight-Tails asks B to unleash his power, but B reminds him that Sabu and Ponta are in the vicinity. He then enters into his Version 2 state and hits Kisame with his Lightning Release: Lariat. Although he manages to severely wound Kisame, Kisame\\'s blade once again devours his chakra, instantly reverting Killer B into his Version 1 four-tailed form. Siphoning the chakra his blade stole, Kisame uses it to heal the injuries sustained from the Lariat. He muses that he is known as the tailless tailed beast and proceeds to utilise his Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave to create a giant water dome. \\n\\nKisame fuses himself with the Samehada, sprouting gills and furthering his shark-like appearance. As the Eight-Tails realises that the dome moves in conjunction with Kisame\\'s movements, the beast suggests that Killer B move in the opposite direction as Sabu and Ponta. Kisame manages to trick B into thinking he would be killing the two comrades; as B swims to protect them, Kisame restrains him. Killer B enters into a partial transformation, morphing the lower half of his body into octopus tentacles to bind Kisame. B manages to get loose as Kisame drains his chakra and shoots out ink to cover his tracks, although Kisame is able to sense his chakra and attacks him until B\\'s chakra is at its lowest. Bursting the dome of water, Kisame prepares to cut off B\\'s legs to prevent him from running away. However, the Samehada blade grows a liking to Killer B\\'s chakra and refuses to sever his legs, instead choosing to transfer back the chakra it stole. In anger, Kisame kicks the blade away and picks up one of B\\'s Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords. Before he can use it to cut off B\\'s legs, the Fourth Raikage, C, and Darui intervene, having spotted the water dome. Using their Lightning Release: Double Lariat, Killer B and the Raikage decapitate Kisame, whose detached head amusingly remarks how fast the two are. The Raikage then berates Killer B for running away from Kumogakure.\\n'},\n",

Sai\\'s ink clone notifies Kakashi, Naruto and Yamato that the other members of the Konoha 11 have decided to kill Sasuke themselves in order to prevent a war from spreading. Naruto does not believe that Sakura would have consented to it, since she is in love with him. However, Sai responds that it is because she loves him that she has agreed to eliminate him, and adds his personal conjecture that he believes that she is planning to kill him herself, much to Naruto\\'s shock. Sai tells Naruto that the only reason Sakura \"confessed\" was to alleviate Naruto from the promise he made, but when Naruto was steadfast in his decision to save Sasuke regardless, she could not bring herself to tell him of their plan to terminate him. He also adds that the reason Sakura is doing all of this is because of what Sai said to Sakura back in Konoha, unintentionally guilt-tripping her into doing this. Naruto\\'s mind is overwhelmed and he almost breaks down, but at that moment the Three Sand Siblings arrive, claiming that they have urgent news to relay.\\n\\nMadara encounters Danzō on the Samurai Bridge, who commands his two subordinates Fū and Torune to deal with Madara until he can remove his Sealing Arm Braces. Using his intangibility, Madara is able to evade all of Fū and Torune\\'s attacks, including the former\\'s Mind Body Switch Technique. Realising that Madara must manifest physically in order to strike back, Fū rushes at him. He goes right through Madara, who turns back and forms a fist. Seeing this, Torune, who had removed his shirt, unleashes his rinkaichū. However, Madara had tricked them into thinking he would manifest and Torune\\'s attack hits Fū instead. As Torune heals Fū, Madara realises that Fū and Torune are from Konoha\\'s Yamanaka clan and Aburame clan, and compliments Danzō for his choice in subordinates. He then uses Kamui to transport Fū and Torune elsewhere, and proceeds to disappear himself.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gaara, Temari, and Kankurō relay the events that transpired at the Five Kage Summit to the three, and notify Kakashi that he is being considered as the Sixth Hokage candidate due to Danzō\\'s actions. Yamato declares that such a decision would need approval from the village elders, but Temari replies that Suna would form their immediate response to the upcoming Fourth Shinobi World War as if Kakashi was Hokage. Gaara tells Naruto that if he is to ever become a Kage someday, he would have to learn to do what was best. He adds that before he met Naruto, he did not know what the word \\'friend\\' meant, and that he considers Naruto to be his friend. Before leaving, he asks Naruto to think of what the word friend means to him before deciding on what to do about Sasuke.\\n\\nIn Kamui\\'s Dimension, Karin finishes healing Sasuke just as Madara phases in front of her. He tells Sasuke that he has a present for him and warps the three of them back to the bridge, where Danzō awaits.

Sasuke demands to know how he obtained those, but remarks that whatever response Danzō gives would simply infuriate him further and that it does not matter since he would kill Danzō regardless. Danzō rushes forward in a burst of speed to attack Sasuke, but the attack is blocked by the latter's Susanoo. Trapped within the Susanoo's grip, Sasuke asks whether Danzō had really ordered Itachi to slaughter his own clan. When Danzō remarks that he never pegged Itachi as the type to divulge secrets before dying, Sasuke accepts it as acknowledgement and crushes Danzō, seemingly killing him.\\n\\nHowever, Danzō reappears right behind Sasuke, and attempts to stab him with a kunai, only for the Susanoo to shield him once more. As Danzō jumps high into the air, Sasuke ascends into the Susanoo's head and incinerates Danzō with his Amaterasu. Despite being burned to ashes, Danzō appears unscathed in front of Sasuke, although Karin notices that every time Danzō survives what seems like a fatal injury, a Sharingan eye on his arm seals itself shut. \\n\\nDanzō uses his Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere to fire wind bullets at Sasuke. Sasuke's flesh is slightly pierced as he moves to evade being mortally wounded by the attack, although he ends up falling off the bridge. Using the blood from his wound, Sasuke summons Garuda, a giant hawk, to prevent his fall. Danzō infuses his Wind Release with his shuriken to create lethan fan blades, and fires the projectiles towards Sasuke. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke is able to evade the smaller shuriken while using his sword to catch one of the Fūma Shuriken and repel the second one into the sky, where it is caught by Garuda. Sasuke then lunges towards Danzō, but Danzō manages to clutch his throat. At that moment, Garuda swoops in and uses the spinning shuriken to slice off Danzō's Sharingan-embedded arm, allowing Sasuke to stab him. \\n\\nWhile the battle seems momentarily won, Danzō and his severed arm fade out of existence and rematerialise on top of a pillar.

However, Sasuke is paralysed at the last second while Danzō muses that Sasuke\\'s genjutsu pales in comparison to Itachi\\'s proficiency with the Tsukuyomi. A cursed seal begins to spread throughout Sasuke\\'s body and Madara realises that Danzō must have applied it when he grabbed Sasuke\\'s throat earlier. Danzō, prying Sasuke\\'s sword out of his hands, muses that leaving him alive was Itachi\\'s greatest mistake and remarks why Itachi would have done such a thing. Recalling how Madara had told him how Itachi was unable to kill him because he thought Sasuke\\'s life was precious, Sasuke manages to manifest a full Susanoo transformation, the resulting chakra eradicating the cursed seal.\\n\\nDanzō jumps down the ground and uses his Wind Release: Vacuum Great Sphere to expel a sphere of compressed wind, although it is unable to take out the Susanoo. Sasuke fashions a bow out of his Susanoo and fires an arrow at Danzō. Despite being impaled, Danzō disappears and rematerialises next to the arrow. Madara is shocked to see that Danzō is employing a secret kinjutsu of the Uchiha clan known as Izanagi, which is a powerful genjutsu capable of blurring the lines between reality and illusion and thus can grant its user the ability to avoid being killed. Sasuke fires another arrow at Danzō, who is forced to sprout a tree from his right shoulder to shield himself. Karin wonders why Danzō did not simply use his \"immortality\" technique to avoid the attack like he had been doing all along, noticing that using the tree significantly decreased his chakra levels. Meanwhile, Madara realises that Danzō\\'s ability to use Wood Release means that Danzō had been transplanted with Hashirama Senju\\'s cells by Orochimaru, and that the Senju cells allows him to wield multiple Sharingan eyes and to use Izanagi despite not being of Uchiha blood; additionally, possessing the First Hokage\\'s Wood Release in conjunction with the Uchiha\\'s Sharingan would grant Danzō the ability to control a tailed beast, notably the Nine-Tailed Fox, and thus realises that obtaining Naruto is one of Danzō\\'s goals.\\n\\nDespite bleeding out of his eye, Sasuke strains himself to fire another arrow, yet Danzō simply uses Izanagi once more to negate its effects. Noticing that Madara is keenly observing the battle and fearful that he may soon join the fray, Danzō decides to summon Baku, a tapir. Using its powerful inhalation, Baku attempts to draw in Sasuke and his Susanoo. Danzō appears behind Sasuke and bombards him with his Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves, which are augmented by Baku\\'s power, to force the Susanoo towards the tapir. Sasuke takes advantage of Baku\\'s inhalation by unleashing his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, which Baku immediately ingests; in pain, it dispels itself out of the battle. As Danzō attempts to strike Sasuke from behind, his attack having caused a weak spot in Susanoo\\'s rear armour, Sasuke turns around and has the Susanoo punch Danzō, who uses Izanagi once more to survive unharmed.\\n\\nKarin observes that another Sharingan eye has shut itself on Danzō\\'s right arm. She counts the ten eyes and notices that there are only five left and realises that once the remaining five are sealed shut, Danzō would not be able to evade fatal injuries anymore. She attempts to relay her findings to Sasuke, but he merely tells her that he had already caught on earlier and thus had been forcing Danzō the entire time to continue relying on Izanagi until he used up all ten eyes. Infuriated, Danzō uses Wind Waves to attack the oncoming Susanoo; while he does not destroy it, he is able to block it. However, Danzō is punched by the Susanoo once more and uses his seventh eye to utilise Izanagi again. Manifesting himself behind Sasuke, whose Susanoo has faded away, Danzō throws kunai towards him, although Sasuke uses his bracelets to produce shuriken, which he throws back. Unable to evade it in mid-air, Danzō employs Izanagi to elude it, leaving him with only two Sharingan eyes on his right arm. As Sasuke forms his Chidori Sharp Spear, he asks Danzō how many Uchihas\\' had to die in order for him to gain ten Sharingan eyes; Danzo, using his Wind Release: Vacuum Blade to transform his kunai into a sword, replies that he could not have done it without Itachi.

However, she admits to herself that she never knew the kind of person he was on the inside, recalling how Sasuke was bit by Orochimaru in the Forest of Death and used the power given to him by the Cursed Seal of Heaven to break Zaku's arms before she was able to stop him from attacking Dosu. Knowing that the cursed seal caused him immense pain, she told Sasuke that the thought of seeing him in pain was unbearable to her, although he merely brushed her off. She recalls how, in order to validate his strength, he had challenged Naruto to a fight and how the two formed their respective Rasengan and Chidori at one another, only for their attacks to be dispelled by Kakashi, who berated Sasuke for trying to kill Naruto.

He credits his change in attitude to Sasuke and Iruka, with whom he formed a bond, the latter even saving his life from Mizuki when Mizuki revealed to him that he was the vessel of the Nine-Tails. Naruto reflects on how he was happy to realise that Sasuke was an orphan like him and thought they could talk and bond over it; however, he and Sasuke had a chasm in skill between them and so Naruto decided to be his rival instead. Smiling, he declares that since that day, Sasuke has been his goal.\\n\"},\n",

He reflects upon the good memories he had, such as when they tried to peek at Kakashi's face, as well as the not so good memory of their fight at the Valley of the End. Sasuke tells Naruto that he would not stop in his quest for vengeance and that Naruto would simply have to kill him or get killed, but Naruto states that he would not let either option happen.\\n\\nIn the real world, the Rasengan and Chidori clash against one another and explodes, causing Naruto and Sasuke to fall backwards towards the rock walls. Naruto's shadow clone flings Kakashi in Naruto's direction to catch him while one of White Zetsu's parasite clones catches Sasuke. Knowing that Sasuke would not retreat, White Zetsu visits Madara at his base, where the latter has Danzō's corpse as well as various Sharingan eyes stored. White Zetsu notifies Madara that Sasuke is in a bit of a bind, and Madara and Zetsu head to the Samurai Bridge.\\n\\nWhite Zetsu and his clones prepare to engage in combat against Naruto, but Madara tells him to stand down, alerting him that he would lose and thus he would set up a fight between Naruto and Sasuke in the future in order to obtain the Nine-Tails. Before they leave, Naruto tells Sasuke that if he ever does decide to attack Konoha, he would be waiting there for him, and would shoulder the burden of Sasuke's hatred. In anger, Sasuke lashes out and demands to know why Naruto is fixated on him, to which Naruto replies that it is because they are friends. Naruto asks whether Sasuke remembers what he had said during their fight at the Valley; how two high-level shinobi can reach others' minds when they exchange fists. Naruto tells Sasuke that he has finally understood what Sasuke is going through, and if it means exchanging blows, then he would continue to do so to further understand him. He asks Sasuke whether he read his mind too, but Sasuke shrugs him off and merely states that he does not wish to and that he would kill him. Smiling, Naruto tells him that if they fought, both of them would die; however, he is optimistic that at least in the afterlife they would be relieved of their respective burdens.\\n\\nKakashi tries to use Kamui to take out Madara, who quickly informs Kakashi that such a technique would not work on him. As they warp away, Sasuke informs Madara that he has something to ask of him. Naruto and his shadow clones quickly fall down, having been poisoned by the cut inflicted by Sasuke earlier; as Sakura administers the antidote, Kakashi locates Karin, who had witnessed the entire thing, and decides to bring her back with him to Konoha. At his base, Madara is asked by Sasuke to have Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan transplanted within his own, as he is beginning to lose his vision after having activated the Susanoo three times in less than a day. When Madara asks why Sasuke thinks he is ready for it now, Sasuke states that he needs the power of the Eternal Mangekyō if he has any chance of killing Naruto.\\n\"},\n",

She along with the other females of the Konoha 11 and Shiho are later invited by Tenten to a girls night out at Yakiniku Q.

The girls are later joined by Shizune and a slightly intoxicated Tsunade.

The battle is witnessed by Naruto, who in turn is noticed by Shizuka's attendant, Tokiwa. She observes Naruto's forehead protector, identifying him as a Konoha-nin, and asks whether he has heard of the legendary sannin Jiraiya and whether Jiraiya had any pupils. Naruto notifies her of Jiraiya's fate as well as the fact that he is Jiraiya's student, only to be stunned by Tokiwa's statement that he must duel and marry Shizuka. She explains that the village is matrilineal and that the law dictates that the kunoichi must marry the man who defeats them in order to have a suitable husband.\\n\\nNaruto returns to Guy, Aoba, and Yamato, who tell him not to get involved in the village's affairs as they only came to restock on their supplies. Later that night, Naruto spots Tokiwa waiting outside the house they are dwelling in and she tells him how the villager's former leader fought Jiraiya for his hand in marriage. However, Jiraiya stopped the fight and promised that their two students would continue the fight in the future. Tokiwa also explains that once, Shizuka had a lover named Sagiri, although Sagiri was a mere tradesman who the village did not believe was worthy to be the husband of the village's leader. When Sagiri was mysteriously killed in an accident believed to be perpetrated by the village elders, Shizuka locked away her heart and decided never to love again.\\n\\nThe next morning, the four Konoha shinobi set out towards the Land of Lightning, unaware that the Naruto on board is a mere shadow clone. Naruto hangs back to talk to Shizuka, but Shizuka only wishes to fight. Tokiwa sets the stage with her Earth Release: Iron Fist Prison to create an arena for their fight. Using her Nadeshiko-Style Deep Crimson Dance Performance, Shizuka throws several kunai at Naruto, who evades them all. Praising his agility, she ups the ante with her Dance Performance: Second Step, launching a barrage of kunai towards him. Naruto creates multiple shadow clones to dodge the kunai, but Shizuka uses her Violent Whirlwind to dispel all of the clones. Seeing only one Naruto left, she rushes at him with her Nadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist, only for it to be none other than a shadow clone; the real Naruto sneaks up on her from behind and declares the match over. \\n\\nShizuka asks Naruto why he did not simply defeat her and he responds that he does not wish to marry her. At that moment, Kokuyō arrives and declares that he would marry her. Using his Hundred Puppet Soul Binding, he takes control of Shizuka's body in an attempt to force her to marry him. Enraged, Naruto cuts the chakra threads with his kunai and strikes him in the torso with his Rasengan, sending him flying away. Shizuka questions Naruto for saving her instead of defeating her, and he reiterates that he does not wish to marry her, adding that he believes one should be in love before getting married. He reveals to her that he is in love with a girl named Sakura, who in turn is in love with someone named Sasuke. Despite the love being one-sided, he tells her that he enjoys the beautiful smile on her face whenever she was near Sasuke and that he would never try to interfere in her love for him since all he wishes is for her to be happy. Shizuka is reminded of her lover, Sagiri, who had said the same thing. Just then, Yamato arrives, intent on punishing Naruto for tricking him with a shadow clone once again.\\n\\nAs they set off towards the Land of Lightning once more, Shizuka remembers her predecessor mentioning how Jiraiya had revealed to her about his one-sided love for Tsunade, and how Tsunade had suffered so much heartbreak that she had closed her heart off. Jiraiya, knowing that she would be the only one to truly hold his heart, decided to fill her presence with love in an attempt just to make her happy, uninterested in any reward. Smiling, Shizuka thinks back upon Naruto who sails away.\\n\"},\n",

He told her that he found her hair beautiful and thus had noticed the trail right away, and that the reason he never interfered before is because he knew she was a strong girl who could handle herself in a fight. At that moment, she fell in love with Minato, who came to love her as well.\\n\\nNaruto giggles uncontrollably as he hears his mother's tale, sporting a huge grin. As a reward for complimenting her hair, Kushina tells Naruto that she is going to tell him something she's only ever said to Minato before, and tells him that she loves him.

Biwako Sarutobi, the wife of the Third Hokage, had then notified the two parents-to-be that the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style would weaken during childbirth and thus Kushina would have to give birth outside of the village, under the protection of a barrier. On the way to the secret location, she came across Mikoto Uchiha, who had just recently given birth to a baby boy that she had named after the Third's father, Sasuke Sarutobi.\\n\\nOn October 10, Kushina began giving birth, as Minato struggled to keep the seal in place as he was too concerned with Kushina's well-being. Kushina remarks to Naruto that somehow, the masked man whom Minato had told Naruto earlier about, had managed to find out the secret location of the birth as well as the fact that childbirth was a female jinchūriki's weakness. While Biwako and Taji served as midwives and helped Kushina successfully give birth, the masked man killed all the Anbu guards stationed outside.\\n\"},\n",

Tobi places explosive tags on the newborn Naruto and tosses him into the air, forcing Minato to catch him, remove the tags and use his Flying Thunder God Technique to teleport outside. Tobi uses the opportunity to use Kamui to teleport himself and Kushina elsewhere, where he extracts the Nine-Tails out of her and, controlling it with his Sharingan, decides to attack Konoha. Meanwhile, Minato teleports to one of his safehouses to keep his newborn son safe and manages to teleport back to Kushina, who had the Flying Thunder God seal marked on her Eight Trigrams Sealing Style, and saves her from being killed by the tailed beast. He brings her back to the safehouse, placing her next to Naruto and dresses in his Hokage attire.\\n\\nIn the village, Guy is pestering Kakashi to compete in another challenge while Tobi sneaks into the village. He summons the Nine-Tails right inside the village and allows it to wreak havoc. Sensing the tailed beast, the Third Hokage prepares to go into battle; Chōza, Shikaku, and Inoichi prepare to defend their village as well. Minato teleports to the village to defend it, and the fox fires a Tailed Beast Ball towards him. Using his Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder technique, Minato warps the Tailed Beast Ball to a safe distance away. He is immediately engaged in combat with Tobi, who attempts to use Kamui to send Minato elsewhere; however, Minato teleports to a safe location just in time. Tobi follows Minato there and praises his Flying Thunder God techniques, while Minato, realising that the masked man in front of him possesses a Sharingan strong enough to control the Nine-Tails while infiltrating the village undetected, suspects Tobi to be none other than Madara Uchiha, albeit immediately dismissing the thought since Madara was thought to be long dead.\\n\\nMinato begins his assault on Tobi, who produces chains from his wrists, but is unable to land a successful hit due to Tobi's intangibility. Noting that Tobi would have to manifest physically in order to strike back, Minato throws one of his Flying Thunder God Kunai at Tobi's head while rushing towards him at the same time. Right as the kunai goes through Tobi's head, he materialises in order to grab a hold of Minato; however, Minato forms his Rasengan and teleports to the kunai's location behind Tobi, and manages to land a successful hit, marking him as well. Tobi is wounded from the attack, as his left arm begins to peel and fall off. Having branded Tobi, Minato is able to teleport to him right away and places a Contract Seal on him, wresting the Nine-Tails from his control.\\n\"},\n",

Awakening back in the Tailed Beast Temple, Naruto mentally communicates what transpired to Killer B via a fist bump, which irritates Yamato, since he cannot understand. He shows his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode to the two, only to immediately sense Kisame\\'s presence within Samehada, shocking the latter since his chakra signature and that of the swords are indistinguishable. Kisame realises that Naruto has the ability to sense his hatred and reveals to a shocked Killer B that the \"Kisame\" he and his brother decapitated was just a Parasite Clone. He attempts to flee with the intelligence he has gathered thus far. Naruto immediately runs and kicks Kisame, his speed stunning Yamato and Killer B, with the latter likening it to the Yellow Flash\\'s. However, Naruto exerts too much power in the kick and sprains his ankle, giving Kisame an opportunity to escape. As Yamato tends to Naruto, Killer B rushes out to intercept Kisame.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Guy wishes to partake in the same training as Naruto and sits in front of the Falls of Truth in order to encounter his inner self. While he initially meets his other side, one who criticised his desire to stay youthful, he is forced to return to reality when Kisame comes bursting through the waterfall. Believing it to be his true inner self, Guy uses his Leaf Rock-Destroying Rise to kick Kisame into a rock wall, only to be told that it is an Akatsuki member. Samehada leaves Kisame to be with Killer B, but Kisame grabs on to Samehada\\'s handle and siphons nearly all of Killer B\\'s chakra. Aoba tries to paralyse him with his Secret Technique Stone Needles, although Kisame merely drains his chakra as well. Declaring that his chakra reserves have been completely filled, Kisame uses his Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique to encase himself inside of a shark made of water and flies through the air, heading to the ocean. Guy activates his Sixth Gate and is propelled into the air by Killer B, who used what little chakra he had left to transform one of his hands into the Eight-Tails\\'.\\n\\nAs he begins to descend prematurely, Guy uses the Summoning Technique to call forth Ningame in mid-air, in order to use the turtle as a stepping stone. Guy manages to catch up to Kisame just as the latter places a scroll containing intel inside of a shark he summoned. Kisame uses his Water Release: A Thousand Feeding Sharks to hide the real shark amongst the other 999, although Guy merely uses his Morning Peacock to dispel most of them. Realising that Kisame and the other sharks have gone underwater, Guy submerges as well, opening his Seventh Gate. Impressed at Guy\\'s taijutsu, Kisame is confident that his next attack would finish his opponent off and employs his Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique, which Guy counters with his Daytime Tiger.

He brings the subdued Kisame back to land, where Yamato restrains him so that Aoba can gather intel on the Akatsuki. Using his Psycho Mind Transmission technique, Aoba sifts through Kisame's memories.\\n\\nBack when Kisame was a Kirigakure shinobi, he was instructed by his superior, Fuguki Suikazan, who was one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, to serve as a bodyguard for Kiri's Cypher Division. Fuguki explicitly instructed him to do whatever was necessary to prevent their intelligence and secret codes from being leaked to any enemies. Whilst serving as their guard, Miru, a kunoichi from the Cypher Division, asked him to come and eat with the others, while the rest rebuffed him as a cold, callous individual. Shortly after, Kisame sensed the presence of enemies, who were revealed to be the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force, led by Ibiki Morino. As Ibiki's team began capturing wounded Kiri-nin alive, Kisame dropped explosive tags near them or impaled them with his sword to kill them, in order to prevent Konoha from gathering intelligence. After being cornered on a cliff, Kisame killed the remaining three, including Miru. With her dying breath, Miru asked why Kisame would do such a thing, and he explained that he had to do what was necessary to prevent an intelligence leak and that killing his comrades was his specialty. Kisame then jumped off the cliff to elude his own capture.\\n\\nAfter reporting back to the village, Kisame discovered that Fuguki himself was leaking intelligence to their enemies and killed his own master as a result, as it was his duty to kill fellow Kiri-nin in order to prevent leaks. After killing Fuguki, he took the swordsman's Samehada blade for his own. The murder was witnessed by Yagura, the Mizukage, who commended him for his efforts. Kisame, however, was wary as he believed that Yagura would simply kill him whenever his usefulness ended and mused that he had no sense of identity and wondered what he could do to achieve peace, instead of being stuck in a cycle of killing and deceit. To his surprise, a man emerged from behind Yagura and offered him the chance to join him as a comrade in order to obtain true peace. Kisame was shocked to see that the man possessed a Sharingan, which he had been using to control Yagura. Knowing that the shinobi in front of him must be quite formidable to not only control a kage but also a jinchūriki, as Yagura held the Three-Tails within him, Kisame demanded to know who the man was. The man declared himself to be none other than Madara Uchiha, and emerged from the shadows in order to show his face and prove it. \\n\\nWanting to protect his leader's identity, Kisame bites through his tongue, disrupting Aoba's technique, and proceeds to break out of his wooden restraints. Knowing he is too weak to fight the shinobi before him, Kisame traps himself inside his Water Prison Technique and recalls when he first met Itachi when they were partnered together, and how Itachi told him that a man does not know his true nature until he reaches the end of his life. Realising that he would rather die in order to protect the Akatsuki, Kisame summons three sharks and commits suicide by allowing the sharks to devour him. Naruto and Yamato are shocked, while Killer B confirms via Samehada that it is not a trick and that Kisame has actually died. Remembering Nagato and Konan, Naruto states that even in the Akatsuki, shinobi would sacrifice their lives in order to protect their comrades. Guy remarks that it is an honourable thing for a shinobi to do so, and declares he would never forget Kisame so long as he lives.\\n\\nGuy picks up the scroll containing the intel Kisame had gathered and opens it, only for it to be rigged. Naruto, Yamato, B, Guy, and Motoi are trapped in a water prison containing sharks while one of the sharks grabs the scroll and flees to the ocean, escaping.\\n\"},\n",

Tobi merely remarks that Kabuto has only joined them to fulfil his own ambitions but notifies him that he is heading to Amegakure as Kabuto smirks.\\n\\nIn Amegakure, Konan stands outside Pain's Tower and smiles at the rain falling down on her village, reminding her of a time when the three Ame Orphans return to their hideout to see Jiraiya dressed as a frog, and how they laughed. Her happiness quickly dissipates by the arrival of Tobi, who wishes to know where she buried Nagato, as he requires the Rinnegan. Using her Dance of the Shikigami technique, Konan splits herself into several flying origami birds and heads out to lake. Tobi joins her at the lake, and asks why she and Nagato had betrayed the Akatsuki; more specifically, he inquires as to why Nagato used the Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive the fallen Konoha civilians when the technique was supposed to be reserved for his use, adding that both she and Nagato had approved of his Eye of the Moon Plan.\\n\\nKonan recalls when Naruto had convinced Pain that he would find the path to true peace no matter what, and how she had told Naruto that he now embodied both Nagato and Yahiko's dreams. Tobi realises that Naruto had swayed Nagato, but remarks that he did not think Konan would be easily affected by the musings of a naïve child. Konan assumes a defensive stance, and Tobi reminds her that the Akatsuki does not tolerate traitors and that he finds it amusing that she still wears the Akatsuki robes despite betraying them. Konan responds that the Akatsuki was formed by Yahiko, with the red clouds representing the bloody rain that fell upon Amegakure, and that Tobi simply retooled the organisation for his own machinations; additionally, the Rinnegan was awoken by Nagato who wished to use it for the welfare of the village, and that she would not allow it to fall into his hands. To her shock, Tobi reveals that he was the one who goaded Yahiko into founding the Akatsuki and that it was he who bestowed the Rinnegan to Nagato.\\n\\nThinking back to when Yahiko had considered himself to the pillar that would support Nagato, whom he believed to be the Saviour of this World and the bridge to true peace, and how Nagato had instead believed Yahiko to be the bridge, Konan remarks that this time, she would be the pillar that held up the two bridges that were her best friends. She sends various sheets of paper serving as projectiles towards Tobi, who merely becomes intangible and allows the attack to pass right through him. As Konan rushes towards him, he grabs onto Konan and uses Kamui in an attempt to transport her elsewhere; however, the sheets of paper have explosive tags on them, which detonate. Using Kamui, Tobi manages to pull himself and Konan from the centre of the blast, although his mask partially breaks and he loses his right arm as a result. Konan, who has lost the lower half of her body, suspends herself in mid-air and uses her Paper Person of God Technique to split the very lake underneath Tobi into two, creating an abyss.\\n\"},\n",

However, Tobi is revealed to have a Sharingan eye in his left eye socket and uses Izanagi to materialise behind Konan, who believes she has killed him. As he stabs her through the back with a metal rod, she asks who he is and how he could have survived. As a favour to her since she helped with the Eye of the Moon Plan during her tenure with the Akatsuki, he reveals the true nature behind Izanagi, likening it to the Sage of Six Paths\\' Creation of All Things Technique and reaffirms that he is the one and only Madara Uchiha, the self-proclaimed second Sage of Six Paths.\\n\\nKonan pulls herself off the rod and hobbles away, before noticing that the rain has stopped. Tobi wonders how the perpetual rainfall of Amegakure could end so abruptly, while Konan, seeing a rainbow and remembering how Yahiko told her how he hated the rain as it made it seem like the village is crying, declares to Tobi that Nagato and Yahiko are giving her strength and that Naruto is the true bridge to peace. She forms and fires a Paper Chakram towards Tobi, who is fighting with only one eye and an arm left. Nonetheless, Tobi is able to surpass her defences and chokes her, placing her within a genjutsu to find out Nagato\\'s whereabouts as she passes away from her wounds.\\n\\nTobi makes his way to Nagato and Yahiko\\'s Shrine, where he remarks that Nagato performed admirably well with the Rinnegan, declaring him to be the third Sage of Six Paths. As he notices Nagato\\'s white hair, Tobi muses how much he must have strained himself to lose his red hair, the trademark of the Uzumaki clan from whom he is descended. Tobi then uses Kamui to transport himself and Nagato to Kamui\\'s Dimension. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper on Konan\\'s body, which is floating on the water, is soaked red with her blood and begins to drift away.\\n\\nIn the past, Jiraiya had enforced a Water on a Frog\\'s Face Training, which utilised a \"hop-in\" card system which the Ame Orphans would use whenever they left their hideout. Whenever one member was out of the hideout they were to turn the card onto the side with the frog so that the others would be aware that they were not there, and while they were in the hideout, the card should be on the red side. If one of them was gone but that person\\'s card was still red, it would signify that he or she had been captured and something was wrong and if it should happen that a plank is turned on to the white side yet the person is in the hideout it could mean that an enemy has transformed into said person and has infiltrated the hideout. Jiraiya explained that this was done as a precaution because Amegakure was still war torn and politically unstable. Konan\\'s memories with Nagato and Yahiko are shown, including the formation of the Akatsuki and her first kiss with Yahiko, and how the three orphans were forced to flee their hideout, albeit promising to one day return along with Jiraiya. The blood-red sheet of paper floats all the way to the hideout, where it places itself on Konan\\'s card, signifying that the four have been reunited at last in the afterlife.\\n\\nDiscarding his torn Akatsuki robe and damaged mask, Tobi dresses himself in a new robe, with the Uchiha clan crest on the back, along with a mask depicting the three tomoe design of the Sharingan, although with two eye holes this time. Kabuto notices Tobi\\'s new eye, while Zetsu notifies him that a scroll from Kisame has arrived, depicting the location of the Nine-Tails.

Sasuke merely rebuffs Naruto, who angrily tells him that the Sasuke Recovery Team risked their lives just to bring him back to Konoha, although Sasuke is indifferent to their actions. Infuriated at Sasuke's callous demeanour, Naruto recalls how Chōji took on Jirōbō in order to give the others a chance to retrieve Sasuke and how Neji did the same when he decided to battle Kidōmaru single-handedly, reminding Naruto that Sasuke was lost in the darkness. Although they managed to retrieve the barrel containing Sasuke, an incensed Sakon activated his cursed seal and pursued them. Kiba and Akamaru, along with Sakon and Ukon, ended up plummeting off a cliff, leaving Naruto and Shikamaru to deal with Tayuya. However, Kimimaro, one of Orochimaru's loyal servants, stole the barrel containing Sasuke and fled; Shikamaru decided to deal with Tayuya himself and instructed Naruto to follow Kimimaro. As Naruto caught up to his foe in a meadow, Sasuke emerged from his barrier and laughed at his new power, before running away. Kimimaro decided to take advantage of Naruto's distraction in order to kill him, only for him to be attacked by Rock Lee, who had arrived in the nick of time to allow Naruto to chase after Sasuke.\\n\\nGritting his teeth as he recalls all the potential sacrifices their fellow comrades made, Naruto lunges towards Sasuke and punches him across the face, although Sasuke kicks him away. Landing in the water below, Naruto realises that Sasuke intends to kill him. He attempts to reach out to his teammate, asking if the memories of Team 7 meant nothing to him, but Sasuke replies that one thing made it worthwhile — his friendship with Naruto. Wishing to kill Naruto in order to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke rushes towards him with his Chidori as Naruto creates a shadow clone and counters the attack with his Rasengan. The clash sends the two of them flying in opposite directions, with Sasuke being amazed that Naruto was able to negate the effects of his Chidori. Sasuke activates his cursed seal as he once more charges towards Naruto with his Chidori, this time succeeding in his attack, puncturing Naruto's right lung.\\n\\nHowever, Naruto is enveloped in the chakra of the Nine-Tails and is able to fight back. Shocked at this new display of power, Sasuke asks Naruto what he is, only for the latter to claim that he is his friend. Naruto viciously attacks Sasuke before pinning him to a rock while Sasuke shouts that Naruto would never understand the suffering he is enduring as he never had parents or siblings and asks why Naruto would go so far for him. Naruto replies that while all of that is true, he views Sasuke as the closest thing he has to a brother and thus is fighting to preserve that bond. Accepting Naruto as his equal, Sasuke puts on his forehead protector. As Naruto enters into his one-tailed form, Sasuke accesses the second stage of his cursed seal and undergoes a transformation, gaining two giant wings as his skin becomes darker and his hair grows out. As the members of the Sasuke Recovery Team are saved, Sasuke prepares an enhanced Chidori while Naruto forms an augmented Rasengan, and the two collide.\\n\\nSasuke emerges victorious from the battle as Naruto is rendered unconscious. Deciding not to kill Naruto and to obtain power in his own way, Sasuke walks away from the Valley and finds his way to Otogakure, demanding Orochimaru to give him power. Meanwhile, Kakashi and Pakkun locate Naruto and bring him back home, as Naruto realises that he has failed in his mission and mentally mutters an apology to Sakura.\\n\"},\n",

Gaara remembers his fight with Naruto and reveals to everyone that he was saved by the fellow jinchūriki, despite them being enemies, and that he made a friend. Gaara tells them that they must put aside their conflicts with the other villages as they share a common enemy now — the Akatsuki — who have attacked each one of their villages in some way, and that if any of them still harbour resentment towards Suna, then they may fight him after the war. He then asks them to provide him with strength to save the friend who once saved him, as the latter is the Akatsuki's target, and his speech boosts the troops' morale, causing them to apologise to one another and follow Gaara as the Fourth Shinobi World War begins.\\n\\nAs the Fifth Mizukage spearheads the Daimyō Protection Squad, Naruto and Killer B continue their training on the Island Turtle, with Naruto managing to successfully balance wooden blocks using his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.

Disregarding this, the Nine-Tails asks him whether he is truly naive enough to believe that he alone could stop a war of this magnitude, with Madara Uchiha at its helm.\\n\\nThe beast then told him that he was welcome to use its power, but Naruto states that he wouldn't fall for that one again and begins to leave. The Nine-Tails takes this opportunity to tell Naruto about the hatred that would spread because of this war and questions whether or not he was ready to bear such hatred. The beast then reminds him of Sasuke and the hatred the young Uchiha bore and how Naruto had never been able to help him since they were children and had refused to make the Seal of Reconciliation during their Traditional Shinobi Sparring match. This causes Naruto to re-enter the Nine-Tails' cage and sends one of the torii flying down to pin the fox down. Climbing on the Nine-Tails' face to look it directly in the eye, Naruto states that once someone started to question their own convictions, it was all over and declared that he would save Sasuke somehow and put an end to the war. He then goes on to state as he left that, if possible, he would like to eventually do something about the Nine-Tails' hatred as well, which greatly angers the fox who tells him that it was hatred embodied. Lost in thought, B tells Naruto to lighten up as they continue on their path with renewed vigour.\\n\"},\n",

Reminding his comrade that he too could detect the enemy using his nose, Kiba advises the young Hyūga to seek medical attention from the Logistical Support and Medical Division. Elsewhere, Nagato and Itachi converse as they travel through the night. Neji eventually makes it to the main medical compound, but is halted at the gate by two Akimichi and is informed that he could not enter until his identity was confirmed by headquarters\\' Sensor Division. Eventually making his way to Sakura\\'s tent, the two have a brief conversation. It is later reported that three medics had been assassinated causing great panic in the compound.\\n\\nAs the medics discuss the situation, Neji declares that he would find the culprit with his eyes; at the same time a mysterious Iwa-nin watches on from the shadows. As panic spreads through the ranks, comrades begin asking each other questions to verify their identities. As two Kumogakure medics do just this, Neji arrives claiming to have lost someone he was tailing. Elsewhere, the mysterious Iwa-nin approaches Sakura. This suspicious ninja, however, turns out to be infatuated with Sakura and expresses his feelings to her, she however turns him down, stating that she was in love with someone else. Back in the tent with the Kumogakure medical-nin, Neji kills the two men, noting that he was the suspicious person and moves on to find Sakura. As Nagato and Itachi are stationed at a shrine of sorts, they wonder why the technique user was going to such lengths to stop them from encountering the opposing forces and surmises that they would be used to break the lull in the war the next day. As the real Neji — who had not gone to the medical compound out of stubbornness — recuperates, Hinata assumes his duties. When Shino told her not to overdo it as well, she noted that the war was to protect Naruto and as such, she would give it her all.\\n\\nBack at the compound, \"Neji\" asks of Shizune\\'s whereabouts and Sakura is able to catch him in a lie when she tells him that Shizune was tending to Tonton\\'s sprained leg and Neji replies that it was a good thing that it wasn\\'t her hand. Asking Sakura to look at his hand again, he attempts to kill her but Sakura drives him into the ground. Pinning him there, she delivers another devastating blow which undoes the transformation and he is revealed to be a White Zetsu Army clone. Demanding that the intruder tell her how it was able to mimic Neji\\'s chakra in that manner, she begins to piece together the clone\\'s abilities. The same thing starts occurring in different Alliance sectors and reports begin pouring into headquarters of comrades killing each other. Believing that someone is controlling the shinobi with genjutsu, Ao notes that even for someone of Itachi\\'s prowess, it would be difficult to pull off such a feat. Inoichi then relays the information he received from the medical division and with this, Shikaku begins to put together a strategy to counter the White Zetsu Army clones.\\n'},\n",

Disonasu also praised Naruto about defeating Pain, the one who scarred him and left him powerless, before kicking the boy repeatedly.

Meanwhile, the rest of Konoha 11, along with Kakashi, Shiseru, Yamato and Sai moved out to the area.\\n\\nDisonasu prepares the summoning of the \"power\" by putting the remaining iron bars while Naruto enters Sage Mode. Miina hums to the sound as the Saezuri is activated, causing the area Naruto is on, the Ama no Hoko, to rise above ground. Kakashi arrived on the scene, revealing Disonasu\\'s past as a bloodthirsty murderer and former Akatsuki subordinate whose specialty is the field of Summoning Technique, having researched Impure World Reincarnation with Orochimaru. Kabuto summons his puppets, the Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone, Hidan, and Deidara. Naruto faces off with the clone, while Deidara uses Explosive Clay to create a diversion and chase Naruto. Disonasu escapes and Hidan faces Shikamaru.

Overpowered, Naruto almost gave in to the Nine-Tails' offer for power when Minato's voice urges the boy to control the tailed beast as Naruto is engulfed in an incomplete six-tailed chakra cloak in the Nine-Tails' image. Over time, as he starts to lose against the clone, the Nine-Tails starts to take control over Naruto's body and assumes a seven-tailed jinchūriki state with Yamato trying to restrain it. At the same time, though followed by Kakashi Hatake, Kabuto Yakushi manages to take his leave in midst of the ensuing chaos. Dokku and Shiseru decide to deactivate the Ama no Hoko and say good-bye to the children. On their way there, they confess their love for each other and decide to get married if they survive before portions of the ground start to sink, with Dokku keeping Shiseru from falling. By that time, Miina is able to get through Naruto, regaining control as he assumed a new form to save Shiseru after telling Dokku to go forward and stop the Ama no Hoko.\\n\\nDokku recalls the tune Miina hummed to change the sounds in the Saezuri to deactivate the tower, and Naruto uses his new power to destroy his clone. Ama no Hoko recedes into the ground as the sun rises. Elsewhere, Kabuto finds Disonasu, who has fled the scene. Disonasu begs for his life, but Kabuto summons the Tonika Village Head, who promptly kills him. As the village head watches Dokku reunite with Shiseru and the orphans in the distance, the Impure World Reincarnation is dispelled and his body returns to dust. With the threat eliminated, Naruto, and his allies celebrate with Dokku, Shiseru, and the orphans. Some time later, Naruto, Sakura, and Sai receive a letter, photographs, and drawings from Dokku and the orphans, thanking them for their heroism, and explaining what has happened since the battle: the Saezuri was resealed in the Hole and the surviving villagers performed a funeral ceremony of the victims of the Tonika Village massacre. He eventually married Shiseru and adopted the orphans; with the power of the Hole sealed away, Miina's hair also gradually turned black. Following the end credits, Kabuto is seen standing amidst coffins containing the reincarnated Akatsuki, the former Five Kage, and the late jinchūriki, undergoing a painful transformation. After shedding his skin, Kabuto dons his maroon snake cloak and glasses, then walks away and smiles as a white serpent emerges from beneath his cloak.\\n\"},\n",

Sensing a nostalgic presence, they are greeted by Naruto and Killer B. Their reunion conversation is cut short when Kabuto Yakushi — thrilled by the prospect of capturing the Eight and Nine-Tails — commands Itachi to attack. After slicing through Itachi\\'s enormous fireball using Samehada, B apologises to the sentient blade, who did not appreciate being used to absorb hot flames. Moving-in, Itachi clashes with Naruto while they converse about Sasuke, and Naruto reveals to Itachi that he knows the truth behind the Uchiha Clan Downfall. A shocked Itachi questions how far this news has spread, and upon hearing that only a few people know, requests that nobody else finds out.\\n\\nThough puzzled by the conversation, Nagato is forced to attack before he can ask for more details, and the battle between the four shinobi ensues.

It is revealed that the crow has Shisui Uchiha\\'s Mangekyō Sharingan implanted in its eye socket, and the eye is rigged to cast Kotoamatsukami (with the order \"protect Konoha\") when it sees Itachi\\'s Mangekyō Sharingan. Now freed from Kabuto\\'s control, Itachi explains that this was the power he had given to Naruto, and that he had intended for it to be used on his brother. During this explanation, however, Nagato\\'s corpse is able to regenerate and Kabuto, excited by the prospect of acquiring Shisui\\'s DNA, has Nagato attack once again. Hidden in his Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, Nagato surprises the group by launching a large-scaled Shinra Tensei before targeting B. B throttles him in his Version 2 form, but Nagato absorbs B\\'s chakra and is restored to his youthful-looking self. With this, Nagato captures Naruto and prepares to remove his soul.\\n'},\n",

In the clutches of Nagato's mechanical arms with a cannon pointing at him in point-blank range, the two jinchūriki are saved by Itachi and his Susanoo. Nagato, however, quickly regenerates and uses Chibaku Tensei with the intent of crushing his targets into the planetary body.\\n\\nThough Naruto raised the alarm that there was little they could do against this technique, Itachi rallies the group and has them use their most powerful long ranged attacks to target the centre of the sphere, effectively neutralising the attack. In the aftermath of this, Itachi is able to pierce Nagato with his Totsuka Sword freeing the Rinnegan-wielder from Kabuto Yakushi's control. With the time he had left, Nagato lamented the fact that he had sullied the brilliant legacy their master had left behind and told Naruto to be the most amazing end to the trilogy that he could be.

Gaara immediately questions Naruto as to why he is on the battlefield just as Shikaku speaks to them and explains why Naruto was there. Gaara asks Naruto if he can handle using the Nine-Tails' chakra so easily, and he answers that he doesn't plan to die until becoming the Hokage, and is not a kid just because Gaara is Kazekage.\\n\\nMobilising to where the Third Raikage was, the two Kage head over to confront the Second Mizukage.

Telling his comrades to retreat nonetheless, his words fall on deaf ears as the Raikage breaks through the wall using his Hell Stab. As the division is set upon again, Naruto and Dodai discuss the legacy of the Raikage leading Naruto to want to know how the Third got the scar on his body which was noted to be the \"ultimate shield\".

Ultimately, the Third ends up stabbing himself with his One-Finger Nukite, and his body begins to disintegrate and he is eventually bound and sealed. Dodai surmises that in the end, no one person could have the strongest shield and spear, noting that in the end, the Third had the strongest spear.

Popping his head out from atop the pyramid, the Second greets his opponents serenely before ducking back in to avoid a volley of shuriken launched at him. Commenting that this was a good spot to hide, the Mizukage tells the Kazekage and Tsuchikage that he would no longer divulge the mechanisms behind his techniques, because if they were unable to defeat him, they had no hope of taking on the opposition's leader. Narrowly protecting his division from another explosion, Gaara then directly takes on the clone and is successfully able to stop the clone after using a mixture of his sand drenched in hail and his father's gold dust to both halt the clones movements and stop it from exploding by keeping it cool.\\n\\nGreatly impressed by this feat, the Second beams at Gaara stating that he and Naruto Uzumaki who had made his way to the battlefield eventually made a good combination. Before being sealed, the Second declares that he had found the golden egg amongst the current Kage after all.

At the same time, Jūgo and Suigetsu continue their search for Sasuke, arriving at one of Orochimaru's hideouts. The two walk in as Jūgo asks Suigetsu of his intention of joining Team Taka while suddenly Jūgo goes on a rampage and attacks Suigetsu. Suigetsu simply reforms and drowns Jūgo in order to subdue him. After this, he discovers a secret room revealed by Jūgo's rampage and finds a scroll containing important information. Sasuke is confronted by a group of White Zetsu Army clones.

However, Madara counters with his Wood Release: Advent of a World of Flowering Trees technique, shattering the golem into pieces. Tsunade remembers the technique being her grandfather's and as the technique released its pollen, she instructs the Kage not to inhale. Gaara suspends the Kage and Ōnoki levitates A. Kabuto muses on how people thought no other shinobi is as powerful as Hashirama Senju, just like how people consider the powers of the Sage of the Six Paths a myth. Elsewhere, the Hokage Guard Platoon along with Dodai and Sagan continue to pursue Mū. While the Kage are distracted, Madara unleashes his Susanoo, causing them to fall through the trees. Madara proceeds to set the forest ablaze and not long after, the five Kage are knocked unconscious. Ōnoki, continuously losing his consciousness, remembers of his talk with the First Tsuchikage about the strong will of the Iwa shinobi. Refusing to give up, Ōnoki destroys the forest created by Madara with his Dust Release and as a result, the Kage regained their consciousness. As Madara's body is reforming from the Tsuchikage's attack, to the Kage's horror, the face formed from the DNA of Hashirama Senju appeared on Madara's chest. Meanwhile, Itachi continues his search for Kabuto, as Sasuke detects the former. Sasuke follows him but his brother refused to talk to him. With no choice, Sasuke attempts to catch Itachi with his Susanoo, only for Itachi to counter with his own. The two begin to have a conversation. Meanwhile at the battlefield, Madara decides to take out Tsunade first after realising she was a Senju and also deemed her a weak woman, pathetic compared to the likes of her grandfather. Tsunade stated that she inherited something more than power from her grandfather — the Will of Fire — something that Madara should not take so lightly.\\n\"},\n",

Upon seeing his brother, Sasuke tries to stop Itachi so that he may speak with him, but the elder Uchiha pressed for time opted to use his crow summons to evade his younger brother. Arriving at the cave where Kabuto was located, Itachi makes his intentions to stop the technique clear, though a haughty Kabuto informs him that it is a technique with nearly no risks to the user. The Kage's battle takes a turn for the worst when the ever-cynical Madara turns the tides against them after they make a mockery of him. Creating multiple wood clones, Madara sends five to each Kage to turn the five on one advantage against them.

Kabuto attempts to rewrite Itachi's mind with the talisman but is thwarted by Sasuke.

Before she loses consciousness, she sees two of Hanzō\\'s men standing over her.\\n\\nEarly the next day, Nagato meets Obito who wants Nagato to join him but Nagato refuses. Once Obito has left, Yahiko arrives in and tells Nagato if someone was just here. Nagato brushes it off. Yahiko then tells him they should leave or they\\'ll be late to the arranged meeting with Hanzō. A few hours later, as Kyūsuke and the others sleep, a messenger mouse arrives, delivering a scroll to Kyūsuke. As they race to the location, Kyūsuke reveals to the others that Konoha\\'s Root division are attempting an assassination of the Akatsuki leaders. Their paths are blocked by Obito and Zetsu, Obito revealing he wants Nagato to know what true pain really is. Kyūsuke and the other members fight, Kyusuke sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill Obito which fails. The rest of the group are then defeated and subsequently killed via Obito\\'s Wood Release: Cutting Technique as Obito and Zetsu depart, leaving the dead bodies of the rest of the Akatsuki group behind. The two arrive in time to witness Hanzō threatening Yahiko, claiming that as the leader of Akatsuki, Yahiko must die and that if he refuses, Konan will die. Hanzō then throws a kunai which lands in the ground a few metres away from Nagato, telling Nagato he must kill Yahiko and if that happens, Nagato and Konan will be allowed to live. Despite Konan\\'s pleading for her teammates to leave, they refuse. Nagato picks up the kunai and begins panicing. Not wanting Nagato to suffer, Yahiko impales himself on the kunai Nagato\\'s holding and expresses his hope Nagato will change the world before he dies. Obito who watches the scene unfold finds himself remembering the day Kakashi killed Rin.\\n\\nWith Yahiko now dead, Hanzo orders his men and the Root shinobi to kill Konan and Nagato as well. This has Nagato using his Rinnegan to stop the approaching kunai which then fall harmlessly to the ground, surprising some of the troops and as Nagato saves Konan, Hanzo uses Fire Release: Exploding Flame Formation to badly damage Nagato\\'s legs. Despite that, Nagato refuses to give up. With the troops approaching, Nagato summons the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path much to Konan\\'s shock, the statue also sending large black receivers into Nagato\\'s own back with the attack manifesting into a dragon who eventually kills the men by claiming their souls, leaving their corpses behind. Once that\\'s over, Hanzō acknowledges Nagato\\'s efforts, revealing that Nagato was the true leader of Akatsuki all along. Despite that, Nagato is not completely satisfied and attempts to kill Hanzō who uses the Body Flicker Technique to escape. The statue then disappears, revealing that in addition to his legs being badly damaged from the earlier attack, Nagato has also become frail and very emaciated, the receivers also now permanently embedded in his back. Sometime later, Nagato is finally driven by Obito Uchiha\\'s Eye of the Moon Plan and along with Konan, agrees to join Obito, Nagato repeating the words Madara told Obito including the fact that hatred is born from wanting to protect love with it also being revealed that due to his injuries, Nagato remains in a machine. Then as Obito and Zetsu leave, Nagato states that Yahiko will always be the true leader of the Akatsuki as it\\'s revealed that Yahiko\\'s body is now the Deva Path and the first of Nagato\\'s Six Paths of Pain.\\n'},\n",

Decrying Guy's words as nothing more that the prolonging of a curse, Kakashi and Naruto rebuff Obito's sentiments, and Naruto tells the Uchiha that shinobi were meant to endure and that even if remembering your friends was a curse, he did not care as he wanted to keep the real Neji Hyūga in his heart forever.\\n\"},\n",

Hashirama wonders who Minato is, and is elated to discover he's the Fourth Hokage, and then apprehensive when Orochimaru tells him Tsunade is the Fifth Hokage. Orochimaru elucidates he did not bring them back to destroy Konohagakure, but to answer Sasuke's questions. Hiruzen confirms what Sasuke was told about Itachi and the village, and Orochimaru questions Tobirama's policies regarding the Uchiha during his time, which Tobirama defends, and explains how the Uchiha fall prey to strong feelings. Sasuke asks Hashirama what is the village and the purpose of shinobi, making it clear his answer would determine Sasuke's actions. Tobirama is outraged, and flares his chakra, only for Hashirama to also flare his, almost making the Naka Shrine crumble. Hashirama praises Itachi, and explains that a proper answer would take time. Orochimaru reveals to them the war Madara is waging, to which Minato and Tobirama sense Naruto and Madara in the distance. Tobirama tries to leave, but is restrained by Orochimaru. Hashirama figures that ignoring Sasuke's request would only create another Madara, which would make winning the war pointless.

With Hashirama praising Madara, he quickly grabs the ethereal sword and counters with several additional hands emerging from the ground to suppress the beast only for the tailed beast to destroy with a swing from another blade. Not wanting the landscape of the current area to be completely decimated, Hashirama quickly retreats to the coastline prompting Madara to give chase. As the Uchiha charged another Tailed Beast Ball onto Susanoo's sword and throws it, Hashirama summons a set of barriers to deflect the attack. Hashirama then attempts to reason with his friend and comrade, wanting to stop the battle but Madara refuses, noting that he has gone too far. Knowing that Madara was beyond the point of being persuaded, Hashirama enters Sage Mode and uses the gigantic wooden construct with which he prepares to attack. As the battle progresses, Hashirama remembers the first time when he and Madara met, skipping stones by a river. When asked who he was, Hashirama noted that he was currently Madara's rival in stone skipping, at which he was winning.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"With the Uchiha and the Senju clans forming an alliance, Madara and Hashirama's childhood dreams of a village where children were not sent to battle had come to fruition. The village itself would ally with the Land of Fire. Early on the two co-founders would stroll around the village looking after the well-being of the villagers. On the cliff where they once talked about their dream as children, both reminisce the moment and Hashirama stated that the Sarutobi and Shimura clans wish to join the village, with others to follow suit. Hashirama also stated that someone has to be chosen to represent the village as the Hokage and a name must be chosen. Madara suggested Konohagakure, a name which a depressed Hashirama states is too simplistic. The Senju leader later suggested that the chosen Hokage's face be carved onto the cliff face as a symbol of it watching over the village. At that moment Tobirama arrived and called his brother away, without even acknowledging Madara. Having heard of his elder brother's intentions to choose Madara as the Hokage, Tobirama argues that things are done democratically now and everyone, even the Uchiha, would not see Madara in the same light as Hashirama. With Madara having overheard the brothers' conversation, Hashirama agreed and he became the First Hokage. Later, Madara brought Hashirama to the Naka Shrine, as the first outsider to see the Uchiha stone tablet. With his Sharingan, Madara decrypted that while one interpretation is that two opposing forces can come together to create peace, another interpretation is that cooperation is a quiet method of conflict. Not understanding Madara's true agenda, Hashirama attempts to persuade him to not leave the village but is unsuccessful. Since then the village has prospered, and the other Great Nations as well as some of the smaller nations have copied the village system. But Madara returned to attack Konoha and destroy his previous dream. The conflict continued as Hashirama managed to strip the Susanoo armour off Kurama and bind the tailed beast from Madara's control at the cost of his Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands. Having been stripped of their most powerful weapons, Madara and Hashirama briefly stared each other down before charging at each other, yelling each other's names.\\n\"},\n",

However Tobirama notes that there had been several Uchiha throughout history which had transcended the limitations of their clan and put the village first. One such person who stood out in his mind was Kagami Uchiha. Noting that he did not hate the Uchiha, but in his capacity as Second Hokage, had to find a way to mediate between clans and the village's well-being — the former being something he noted his brother foolishly thought would dissipate with the creation of the village system. In turn, both the Third and Fourth, noted that they had fallen short of their predecessor, and the expectations people had of them respectively. Having heard all he needed from the Hokage, Sasuke comes to the conclusion that the village and people that Itachi sacrificed his life to protect should not be wasted, and decides to enter the battlefield in order to follow his brother's will, with Orochimaru following out of interest. Motioning to Tobirama to prepare to transport them, Tobirama informs his brother that they could not do so because they were bound. As they left the Naka Shrine, Suigetsu who decided that fighting alongside who he deemed the four strongest reincarnated shinobi and three monsters was not a viable option tried to slip away, only to be met by a kick from Karin. She yells that she will never forgive him for what he did and Sasuke immediately apologises. Karin, who visibly cannot contain herself, runs up to Orochimaru and tells him that he stabbed her. He recommends that she should cooperate Sasuke for the time being so she reluctantly rubs against Sasuke, saying she has no other choice. As the Hokage prepare to make their way to the main battlefield, Hashirama — who can barely contain his excitement at this point upon seeing the village again — directs his fellow Hokage to their respective faces on the Hokage Rock before declaring that he wanted to know what his old friend had been up to, Tobirama declares that this time he would stop Madara for good, Hiruzen notes that he had not been to war in so long but vows to give his all this time, and Minato, delighted that he will finally meet his son, promises to make up for not being there with a huge surprise.\\n\"},\n",

Elsewhere, Madara grows increasingly excited at sensing Hashirama's chakra. Obito remarks how the Ten-Tails is beyond suppression as it unleashes the Tenpenchii. Kakashi attempts stopping it with his Kamui before he is intercepted by his former team-mate and the two go to the other dimension and the former puts his trust in Naruto. The Ten-Tails's technique causes massive destruction yet the shinobi survive thanks to Naruto and much to Madara's shock. Unfortunately, the young jinchūriki is worn out and injured, leaving Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and causing the cloaks of the alliance to fade away. The Ten-Tails senses several tailed beasts' chakra within the young ninja and increases it's power. Grateful, Hinata and some shinobi stand as Naruto's defence as Sakura heals him. Landing better, Kakashi gains the upper hand against Obito, having a Lightning Cutter aimed at him. Obito comments on how just like before, Kakashi has a chance to finish him off but hesitates. Kakashi still tries to persuade his old team-mate into reverting to how he was before but is taunted about failing and still believing so. The Uchiha explains that he is able to mock Naruto now because he was once like him. He goes on to reveal that he is aware of the true story of Rin's death being that Kiri-nin planned to use her to unleash the Three-Tails on Konoha and she purposely made herself to die by Kakashi's hand to protect her village. Alas, he uses genjutsu to show his former team-mate that his heart is empty and the Infinite Tsukuyomi can help people to fill the holes in their hearts.

As Naruto talks to him, Obito begins to regrets his actions, imagining how things would be had he been Hokage.

At the same time, Hagoromo has the same conversation with Sasuke, revealing his status as Indra's reincarnation, and having him realise Naruto is Asura's. Hagoromo goes on to explain that Hashirama and Madara are the previous reincarnations, and that by taking Hashirama's power, Madara recreated Hagoromo's chakra, awakening the Rinnegan, despite leaving Indra's descendants instructions against it. Hagoromo explains that his mother Kaguya used her powerful dōjutsu to rule over humanity, and that Madara is on his way to acquiring that same power. Hagoromo asks Naruto to stop Madara, who accepts his request. The chakra of the tailed beasts converge, and Hagoromo notes the prophecy he heard long ago has come true. As entrusting only Asura had created so much conflict, Hagoromo asks Sasuke to cooperate as well, and entrusts both Naruto and Sasuke with his powers. Having survived and being impressed by Guy's Evening Elephant, Madara asks Guy to keep on fighting him, deeming him the strongest taijutsu user he has ever faced. Guy prepares to use his last technique while Naruto and Sasuke awaken. As Guy prepares the Night Guy, Kakashi recalls his father's accurate prediction of Guy's potential when they were children. Guy's powerful kick lands on Madara, through the Shinju, almost killing him. Guy's body begins to disintegrate and an elated Madara, regenerating from the attack, attempts to finish him with a Truth-Seeking Ball only for Naruto to kick it away, much to his surprise. Naruto touches Guy, stopping his life force from fading. Madara notices a change in Naruto, wondering what Obito did. Naruto declares he feels he can change the world with his new powers.\\n\"},\n",

In the meantime, Konohamaru, not comprehending the rotation aspect of the technique, asks Kiba, Chōji and Hinata to help him out, but to no avail. Deciding to heat-up the sexiness of his Sexy Technique, Team Ebisu goes to Ebisu for some help, thinking that it would help Konohamaru learn the Rasengan more quickly. Taking a few magazines from his sensei, the team takes their leave. Later, using the Transformation Technique to transform into a girl spinning a hula-hoop, Konohamaru, with enough practice, pops the water balloon using chakra and shows it to Naruto, who gives him a rubber ball and tells him to practice power. Having no idea how to do it, Konohamaru, alongside Moegi and Udon, go ask Ebisu for help again. Meeting him in the park, alongside Iruka, all three transform into sexy girls and asks which one, in his opinion, is the most attractive. Ebisu then gives some advice to Konohamaru, which inspires him to use his Sexy Technique to transform into a girl, hiding her breasts and then revealing them, sending Ebisu flying with a bloody nose, in a comedic fashion.

Fugaku and Itachi discuss the clan's situation and wishes, which include Fugaku becoming Hokage. Fugaku has kept his Mangekyō Sharingan a secret from others, certain that if the Uchiha knew he could control the Nine-Tails, the conflict would escalate, and through genjutsu, shows Itachi what would happen. Fugaku wants to use Itachi's position as an Anbu to restrain the upper echelons of the village, so a coup can be bloodless. Itachi informs the higher-ups about the imminent coup. Despite Hiruzen's wishes for diplomacy, Danzō gives Itachi an ultimatum regarding the fate of the Uchiha. Upon making his decision, Itachi approaches Tobi for help. Tobi attacks the Uchiha at the police force, while Itachi attacks the ones at the compound. Izumi tries to attack Tobi, but in vain.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Madara Uchiha continues to tell Sasuke about the truth behind Itachi's actions. When Itachi was four, he had witnessed the deaths of many during the Third Shinobi World War, and thus developed a pacifist nature. Sasuke and Itachi's father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the coup d'état that would have had the Uchiha clan overthrow the Senju government. \\n\\nIn order to aid in his coup, Fugaku had Itachi placed within the Anbu so he would serve as a spy for them. However, Itachi's loyalty was not towards his clan, but towards the village, and wanted to do what was best for Konohagakure. Thus, the Konoha Council and Danzō Shimura had exploited that trait and had Itachi spy on the Uchiha clan for them. When the Third Hokage was unable to come to a peaceful negotiation with the Uchiha clan, the elders decided to eliminate them. Itachi was tasked with a hard decision — allow his clan to carry out its coup, causing the destabilisation of their village, deaths of countless innocent people as well as incite neighbouring nations to invade them, potentially starting the Fourth Shinobi World War, or to exterminate his clan in order to prevent a war and the numerous casualties that would come with it.\\n\\nMadara tells Sasuke that around that time, he had infiltrated Konoha in order to have his vengeance on the village itself as well as the Uchiha clan who had shunned him. Itachi was the only person who had known he was still alive and had managed to locate him, and had proceeded to offer him a counter proposal — he would help Madara extinguish the Uchiha clan in exchange for sparing the village, which Madara had readily agreed to. However, while Itachi had managed to murder his father, his mother, and his lover, he was unable to kill his little brother, and thus had spared Sasuke's life. Following the clan's massacre, Madara and Itachi had split their ways while Itachi, reporting the mission's success to the village, had left Konoha; however, he had asked the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe from harm and threatened to leak the village's intelligence to unallied nations otherwise.\\n\\nSasuke refuses to accept Madara's story, claiming that Itachi had murdered their clan to test the limits of his abilities, that he was nothing more than a criminal who joined the Akatsuki, and that Itachi had no reason to protect him, citing that Itachi would not have used his Mangekyō Sharingan against him if he was not trying to kill him. Madara reveals to Sasuke that Itachi's goal, other than implanting the Amaterasu within Sasuke, was to seal away Orochimaru as well as Sasuke's Cursed Seal of Heaven, a feat that was only capable if he had reduced Sasuke's chakra levels to their bare minimum. Madara also divulges that following the Konoha Crush, Itachi's true motive for returning to the village was to make sure that Sasuke would be kept safe from the likes of Danzō following the Third's death, and that he was also spying on the Akatsuki from within for Konoha's sake.\\n\\nAs Madara finishes his tale, Sasuke stands on a cliff, noticing at a hawk flying around. Tears streaming down his face, he recalls the memories of his brother he had before the clan's massacre and how much he had loved and respected Itachi. He then declares that he is renaming their team from Hebi to Taka, and that their new mission is to destroy Konohagakure, awakening his own Mangekyō Sharingan in the process.\\n\"},\n",

She confirms with her Byakugan that they are reincarnations of Asura and Indra. Kakashi asks Kaguya her intentions, but she deems it pointless to explain to shinobi who tamper with chakra, ignorant of its meaning. Not wishing to damage the world with more fighting, Kaguya teleports everyone, including herself, to a lava-filled dimension. While she hovers above, Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, Sakura and an unconscious Obito begin falling towards the lava. Sasuke saves himself by summoning Garuda to fly on it, then has Garuda catch Naruto. Kakashi saves Obito by pinning him to a wall with a kunai, and saves himself by pinning one end of an opened scroll to a wall with a kunai and hanging onto the other end like a rope with Sakura in his arms. \\n\\nKakashi surmises that they aren\\'t in a genjutsu, but in an entirely different dimension. Sasuke explains to Naruto that he and him must not be killed or else the world will end because only they can seal Kaguya away.

Sasuke activates Susanoo, blocking most of the hair needles, but a few strike Garuda\\'s tenketsu, causing them all to fall. Naruto manages to activate his flight ability and catches his comrades with chakra arms. Intent on reuniting chakra once again, Kaguya releases a wave of chakra fists. Naruto manages to briefly counter her attack, but is overpowered, however, it creates an opening for Sasuke to attack with his Susanoo. Kaguya counters his attack, shattering Susanoo. After Sasuke teleports to Naruto, Naruto creates a floating platform from a Truth-Seeking Ball for Sasuke.

The stream is drying, but a dangerous bear lives near the source of the stream. Using his Byakugan, Hamura discovers a large boulder blocking the stream. Gamamaru introduces himself to the two as the one who placed the boulder. While the three talk, a bear approaches, but Gamamaru effortlessly drives it away, impressing Hagoromo and Hamura.

He instructs them to see the truth beyond the peak themselves and leaves. \\n\\nUpon returning, the two meet a salesman wishing to get permission from Kaguya to sell medicine. Hamura peeks into his wares, exposes him as a fraud, and warns him to leave, as they are able to cure illnesses themselves.

They are approached by a man named Sukea, who having overheard them, tells them Kakashi's ninja registration photo should show him unmasked. Sukea introduces himself as a photographer interested in getting a big scoop. Sukea joins their mission. That night, the four manage to break into a secret documents' storage unit, and even find Kakashi's registration photo, but are apprehended by Anbu before they can look at it. The next day, they are scolded by the Third Hokage, and when talking to Kakashi, Sukea tries blaming the situation on Team 7. Team 7 calls him out on it, and he offers to photograph Kakashi's face himself while he eats. Team 7 points out they've tried that before, and something always interrupts them when Kakashi has a meal. Naruto tries offering Kakashi dango, but Kiba comes by with Akamaru, who jumps on some pigeons. In Sukea's photos, Kakashi's face is blocked by a pigeon, Akamaru or leaves. Team 7 is about to give up when they're approached by Teams 8 and 10. Later, Hinata runs to Kakashi, saying a woman has drowned in the river. She takes him to her, in reality a disguised Naruto drugged by Sakura. They intend to expose Kakashi's face by having him perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but he decides to take the disguised Naruto to the hospital instead. Hinata reports the plan's fail. On his way to the hospital, Kakashi is attacked by Chōji, distracting him and causing him to land on Shino's kikaichū, leaving him immobilised. Ino tried body switching with Kakashi, but a frog leaps in front of her jutsu as Shino calls back his insects. Shikamaru traps Kakashi with his shadow, and Naruto gets out of his disguise, calling out for Sukea. Shikamaru begins forcing Kakashi to unmask himself, but Team Guy comes around, Neji running away from Lee, who wants to spar with him, followed by Tenten. Neji and Lee kick up some dust running around, while Tenten ends up tripping Shikamaru, breaking his hold on Kakashi. Kakashi vanishes, revealing he was a shadow clone all along. Sukea bids the genin farewell, while Kakashi watches from afar with Team Guy, who are actually transformed shadow clones. When Team 7 walk their way, Kakashi and his disguised clones are also released. Sukea grows apprehensive when he walks past Guy, who asks him if there was any trouble, having heard about the earlier commotion with Kakashi and the genin. Guy asks Sukea if they've met before, which Sukea denies. Guy leaves, sure he's met Sukea before. In his apartment, Sukea begins removing his disguise, revealing himself to have been Kakashi all along, and going to shower. Kakashi thinks back to earlier, and concludes his team's team-work is improving, and that he won't be able to pull something like this again many more times.\\n\"},\n",

Kaguya decides to return to her first dimension while she replenishes her chakra. Naruto tries to use his abilities to save Obito, as Black Zetsu mocks not only about Naruto's futile efforts, but Obito's wasted life; and though Obito agrees to this, Zetsu's words do nothing but infuriate Naruto. Wasting no time when he realised that his dōjutsu's ability was useable once more, Sasuke launches an attack on Kaguya, forcing her to shift dimensions once more to narrowly escape the attack. Noting that this time he would be the distraction, Sasuke engages Kaguya giving her no time to relent as he dons his Complete Body — Susanoo and flies towards her. Obito uses this time to impart his final words to Kakashi and Naruto, thanking them for allowing him to remember who he used to be. After telling Naruto to become Hokage, Obito finally disintegrates into a pile of ash, leading Black Zetsu to comment that Obito was a cockroach for having lasted so much longer than a regular insect. Enraged at this point, Naruto declares that because he wanted to become Hokage at one point, Obito was an awesome person in his eyes, and proceeded to fly up to Kaguya at an extreme speed, severing her left arm with his own chakra arm.

Sasuke explains that based on Itachi's life, he's come to the conclusion that a true Hokage is one who shoulders the hatred of others. Sasuke intends to concentrate all power and all hatred on himself. Naruto points out others would not agree with his plan, but Sasuke doesn't care. Sasuke is certain he has all the power he needs to carry out his plan. Naruto argues there are things that can't be done alone, like the fight against Kaguya. By killing the tailed beasts and the Kage, Sasuke wants to erase the darkness of the past. Naruto denounces erasing the past, having been shaped by his past as well. Hagoromo begins fading away, and tells Kakashi to keep having faith. Thinking of their answers, Hagoromo fades. Naruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with taijutsu. Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself, and skewers them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke teleports behind Naruto, and sends him back with Chidori. Sasuke begins firing Susanoo arrows, which Naruto blocks with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow fireballs at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with Kurama's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them. Naruto hesitates using a Tailed Beast Ball when Susanoo is down, giving Sasuke an opportunity of using Kirin. Sasuke chastises Naruto for stalling. Naruto refuses to let Sasuke go alone again. The two clash with a Susanoo: Chidori and a Tailed Beast Ball. In each other's minds again, Sasuke expresses the need to kill Naruto, and tells him that they are both different from the last time they fought there. Naruto points out there's no guarantee the world Sasuke creates won't have the same darkness as before, and that the five villages are finally united at peace. Sasuke argues the only reason that happened is because were forced to band together to defeat common enemies in Akatsuki, Madara, and Kaguya. Naruto asks what happens after Sasuke dies, no longer fulfilling the role of common enemy. Sasuke answers that with the power of the Rinnegan, he has many ways of leading from the shadows.

Sasuke sends a couple of the clones crashing down, while cutting down limbs from others. Naruto manages to immobilise Susanoo for a moment, but his attacks do nothing against it. Naruto and Sasuke take the fight above the clouds. Sasuke uses lightning arrows against Naruto's Tailed Beast Balls, creating massive explosions. As Sasuke prepares his next arrow, a previously downed Kurama shadow clone disperses, sending Naruto a massive amount of natural energy. Naruto merges the remaining Kurama shadow clones into a single, multi-armed, multi-faced avatar, creating a massive Rasenshuriken and Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken. Naruto reiterates his desire of beating Sasuke fair and square, though not the current Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke's attacks clash, causing a titanic explosion. The two crash down in a heavily damaged Valley of the End, exhausted. Seeing Naruto still alive, Sasuke uses Amaterasu. Naruto blocks it, coating himself in Kurama's chakra, and throws it aside. Naruto lands a few hits, and after Sasuke lands one himself, he paralyses Naruto's clones with electrified shuriken. Sasuke thinks he's hit the real Naruto with Chidori, but the real one hits him from the side. Sasuke doesn't have enough chakra to maintain Chidori, and Naruto stumbles with his Rasengan.

They recall Naruto saying their next fight would result in their death, in the Land of Iron. As they shift through several significant locations from their past, the two wonder if they are dead. Sasuke recalls how they were both ostracised from the village, wondering if in that sense, they really were brothers. Naruto denies that conclusion, apologises to Tsunade for dying before becoming Hokage, and worries about not being there to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke scoffs at his concern with the living, and points out Sakura and Kakashi are still there, and will figure something out. He thinks of meeting Itachi again soon. Sasuke wakes up at nighttime, Naruto telling him if they move too much, they will bleed out and die. Sasuke asks why Naruto tried maintaining his bond with Sasuke once he started cutting them. Naruto points out again that he is his friend. Sasuke asks what that means to him. Naruto explains that seeing Sasuke take on so much hurts him. Sasuke thinks back to seeing Naruto seeking attention, how his attempts to bond reminded him of his own family, and how he also saw it as a weakness. Those sentiments only grew once they were assigned to the same team, and started going in missions together. Sasuke sees the memories of Naruto's struggles, and his exchanges with Itachi about what it means to be Hokage, and Sasuke realizes the importance of his friends. This time, Naruto and Sasuke wake up at dawn. Sasuke laughs when Naruto expresses his wish to keep fighting him in their state. As the sun rises, Sasuke admits defeat, and concludes that if he dies, the cycle of revenge will end with him. Sasuke tells Naruto he can release the Infinite Tsukuyomi after he dies by transplanting his Rinnegan into someone else. Naruto tells him if he is willing to die, he should live and help Naruto make all shinobi cooperate. Sasuke doubts others would want to cooperate with him, and is wary of turning against Naruto again. Naruto is certain he will not, and when Sasuke asks him how he knows, Naruto again alludes to their friendship. Sasuke begins to cry, and turns his face away.

Tadaichi confirms he's from Konoha, but denies being a shinobi, claiming to be just a merchant. The person reveals they checked his Anbu history, and uses a dōjutsu against him. The person is approached by another, congratulating them. The first promises to stain everything red. Sakura and Naruto visit Kakashi. Sakura asks about missing Konoha shinobi, which Kakashi is already aware of. An explosion happens by one of Konoha's gates. Naruto and Sakura go investigate. Five people are attacking the security personnel from the gates. Ino, Shikamaru and Chōji arrive at the scene, where Ino recognises Tadaichi as a regular from Yamanaka Flowers, certain he'd never turn against the village. Tadaichi is hit with a shuriken, but feels no pain, and begins expanding. Naruto creates clones and takes the security personnel away from Tadaichi, who explodes. The explosion slightly injures the other four attackers, who move into the village and begin expanding as well. At Shikamaru's suggestion, Chōji expands himself, and uses his butterfly wings to flap at the explosion. Naruto adds to it with a Rasengan. More controlled attackers appear beyond the gate, and Sakura deduces the injuries are what is causing them to explode. Hinata arrives, and upon learning of the situation, she confirms there is no one near casting genjutsu, though she detects a foreign chakra in the attackers. Shikamaru restrains the attackers with his shadow, and Hinata attacks their chakra network, defeating them without triggering explosions. Later, Sakura tries releasing the genjutsu, but is unsuccessful. Kakashi decides to have Sasuke analyse the genjutsu with his dōjutsu, and asks Sai to inform him. Elsewhere, Sasuke thinks back to his journey, and feeds a few stray cats. Noticing one of Sai's ink hawks, Sasuke opens up a scroll, and the hawk turns into a message in it. Sasuke hears an explosion nearby, where controlled people are also exploding upon being injured, which Sasuke recognises as the same ones from Konoha's message. Two shinobi come to the aid of an older man in the attacked village, Iō. Iō mistakes Sasuke for an attacker, and commands the other two to attack him. Sasuke easily counters Chino's Water Release with his Fire Release, and dodges Nowaki's wind-infused weapons. The attackers cross Chino's water wall, and Sasuke stops them with his Sharingan, surprising Chino. Sasuke asks them about the one Iō mistook him with, but Iō refuses to talk. Chino explains she and Nowaki are former shinobi who are now wandering performers. Iō wants to check on his daughter Amino. Inside the shelter, Amino is also under the genjutsu, causing others to run away. She stabs herself in the neck, and explodes. Iō screams he will never forgive Fūshin, and runs into the fire. Sasuke questions one of the people he released from the genjutsu about who Fūshin is. He is told Fūshin is the leader of the Lightning Group, a group who steals money from bad people and gives it to those in need. After the group was supposedly betrayed by Kirigakure, they asked for shelter in the village, who refused to harbour them in fear of retaliation. Sasuke tries using genjutsu to see into the memories of the controlled attackers, but meets resistance in the memories, seeing a red eye. Sasuke surmises it's a kekkei genkai.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Sasuke wants Fūshin to tell him everything he knows. Fūshin wonders if Sasuke can make him, and creates a strong windstorm. Sasuke dodges Fūshin's exploding chakra blades, getting nearer to Fūshin, but he increases the strength of the windstorm, turning it into a typhoon. It takes Sasuke manifesting his Complete Body-Susanoo to cut through Fūshin's typhoon. Fūshin creates a greater typhoon, and Sasuke dispels his Susanoo, and takes advantage of the eye of the storm, where there is no wind, to get to Fūshin and strike him with Chidori. Sasuke tries reading his memories with the Sharingan, but again meets resistance from the Ketsuryūgan. It takes Sasuke using his Mangekyō Sharingan to break free. Fūshin is no longer there. Sasuke makes his way to the Valley of Hell, and wonders if the Chinoike clan really lived there. Chino reveals herself, telling him they did. Chino tells Sasuke about the plights of being forced to live there, and how she was alone by the time En kidnapped her. The mention of her loneliness reminds Sasuke of himself and Naruto. Sasuke's interest in her loneliness causes her to show him her story with the Ketsuryūgan, being forced to become a shinobi by En Oyashiro. After she awakened the Ketsuryūgan, En made her fight in the Coliseum, where she defeated Fūshin, causing him to belong to En Oyashiro. Chino befriends him as they talk about kekkei genkai and how each sees the other's past. One day, they found historical documents about the Chinoike clan, Fūshin suggesting them go to the Valley of Hell look for them. They gathered people who wanted to escape Oyashiro and fled. They came in defence of the Bamboo Village one day, and came to be known as the Lightning Group after fighting for the sake of poor villages. Kirigakure began to employ them, until they decided to get rid of them. The group sought asylum at the villages they had helped, where they were denied, out of fear Kirigakure would retaliate against them. Two of their group died and Karyū left, leaving only the two of them, so they finally reach the Valley of Hell. Chino despairs as nothing there triggers any memory of her past. They are attacked by Kirigakure shinobi, and in the fight, Chino causes one of them to explode with her Ketsuryūgan. Chino vows revenge for her clan.\\n\"},\n",

Her plans changed after Iō last words put Sasuke on Fūshin's track. Chino explains the Chinoike clan's jutsu uses blood, and that with the high iron content of the lake in the Valley of Hell, she'll be even more powerful. She uses her blood and the lake to create a multi-headed blood dragon, but Sasuke quickly decapitates all of its heads with his electrified sword. \\n\\nChino manages to wound Sasuke, and as his wound closes, she uses the Ketsuryūgan to show him himself turning into an exploding human. Sasuke asks her if that's how she creates them, and Chino realises she's under the Sharingan's genjutsu, Sasuke standing on her blood dragon, which collapses. Chino envied Sasuke because he always had someone to love him, while she was alone from the start, which reminds Sasuke of Naruto and Sakura. Chino asks Sasuke why he still fights for Konoha, and he tells her about Naruto. Chino isn't convinced the world they want to bring about can be a reality, and tells Sasuke to kill her. Fūshin arrives, in bad shape, and tells Sasuke he'll have to kill him to get to Chino. Sasuke tells Chino his words to her should make sense now. Chino asks Fūshin not to fight, as she couldn't bear losing him. Chino wishes she hadn't met him in the Bamboo Village, so she could still hate him, and wishes to see the world Sasuke spoke of. \\n\\nIn Konoha, guided by Hinata's Byakugan, Sakura finishes extracting the foreign chakra infecting the exploding humans. They talk about the apprehension of the perpetrators, and how Sasuke wasn't there when they thought he would be. In prison, Kakashi meets Chino, Fūshin and Karyū, and Chino claims responsibility for the incident. Kakashi tells them the Mizukage wants to take custody of them. Mei arrives with Chōjūrō, and aware of their past connection with the village, wants them to help Kirigakure, as a form of atonement. \\n\\nAt the Coliseum, Sasuke challenges all the shinobi, to earn them all their freedom. Chino is concerned about him fighting so many shinobi with kekkei genkai, but Naruto assures her Sasuke will win. After defeating all the shinobi, Futsu asks Sasuke what will happen to them. He says Kumogakure will take them in. The Raikage arrives with C, Darui, and several other shinobi. As the island of the Coliseum is nearest to Kumogakure, Kakashi argued with the Raikage they're his responsibility, as well as arresting all the Coliseum's patrons. A tells Sasuke about the time Naruto begged him not to kill him, and how he's glad he didn't. \\n\\nEn Oyashiro meets up with Orochimaru, having escaped arrest. They discuss the Chinoike clan, En Oyashiro revealing himself to have the Ketsuryūgan, to be Chino's father, and to have killed the clan. Seeing how Chino's time in the Coliseum was harming her, he coordinated with Orochimaru to use Sasuke to stop her.\\n\\nNaruto and Sakura discuss Sasuke. Sasuke receives a message from Naruto by hawk, where Naruto says Sasuke protecting the village is like he's from the Konoha Police Force, which sparks in Sasuke a memory from talking with Itachi about wanting to join. Sasuke thinks maybe it's time to visit Konoha.\\n\"},\n",

At the end of the day, Shikamaru and Kakashi discuss how things have changed during peace times, and how Shikamaru is doing a desk job so he can help Naruto become Hokage in the future. Kakashi invites Shikamaru to eat, but Shikamaru has a game scheduled with Ōnoki. At the game, Shikamaru beats him. Later that night, Shikamaru trains.

Shikamaru says he has to leave for Shinobi Union business. On a Shinobi Union meeting, Shikamaru is asked about the drop in mission requests, but says it's still being investigated. Later, Temari tries getting more information out of him, but when he evades her questions, she slaps him. Shikamaru informs Kakashi Temari is growing suspicious of him, and that their independent investigation on the Land of Silence could lead to Shinobi Union intervention due to rogue and missing shinobi potentially undertaking illegal missions there. They finally receive word from Sai, who left to infiltrate the Land of Silence. Sai's report gets them worried, and Shikamaru requests two Anbu to accompany him to the Land of Silence. Shikamaru is introduced to Rō and Hinoko, who were selected based on Shikamaru's mention of preferred abilities. Shikamaru visits his father's and Asuma's graves.

Shikamaru, Hinoko, and Rō scout Sai's last known location, an inn. Shikamaru has disguised them as merchants to get past a checkpoint into a village, Tobari, while Hinoko argues it would be easier to kill the lookouts. Shikamaru points out doing so could reveal Konoha's involvement, and that Sai's team was killed. While Shikamaru talks of teamwork, Hinoko uses her chakra needles to kill a shinobi spying on them. She kills another one, who ends up falling on top of the vehicle they were using to pass as merchants. Shikamaru goes to the inn, where he manages to get information playing shōgi with a patron. He takes off before Hinoko can expose them, and chastises her for being so rash, while she refuses to botch a mission by being overly cautious. Rō tells Shikamaru she fears shinobi will be made obsolete in peace times, having not had the chance to prove her worth during the last war. The inn is interdicted, the shinobi Hinoko incapacitated outside being discovered, so everyone inn can only leave after having their identification verified. They escape with the help of Komori, who dislikes Tobari officials. Hinoko argues with Shikamaru about being allowed to act in the mission, and wonders she'd have more freedom in the Land of Silence. She storms off and talks with Komori in the inn, venting about her frustrations. As she returns, she overhears Rō and Shikamaru talking about silencing her if she truly wishes to desert Konoha. Komori tells her how to reach the Tobari checkpoint. Shikamaru and Rō follow her, but are interrupted by enemy shinobi. Hinoko reaches the checkpoint, where she announces her wish to join the Land of Silence, and incapacitates one of the guards to prove her skill. The guards notice the wound inflicted by her jutsu is the same on their killed comrades, and talk about a Konoha Anbu that spied on them a while back. Before they attack her, Komori shows up, vouching for her. Shikamaru and Rō arrive, and a fight ensues. Rō stops Shikamaru from harming Hinoko, saying they're misunderstanding her. Hinoko kills them both with her chakra needles, proving herself, and is brought inside. She puts Komori to sleep, and rejoins Shikamaru and Rō, who she only put in a death-like state for a while. Rō and Shikamaru suspected Komori when Rō faked a chakra presence in the inn and he reacted to it. The three successfully infiltrate Tobari.\\n\"},\n",

Shikamaru notices the lack of wind in Tobari. Hinoko feigns being killed by her own jutsu during initiation, and is taken to a room full of corpses. Shikamaru shows Rō the little intel they have on Gengo, a single blurry photo. Hinoko reunites with Rō and Shikamaru, informing them about how no one seems to know anything about Gengo or the Fushū Castle. The three go around Tobari gathering information, seeing people from all over, learning Gengo arrived ten years prior, and that Tobari is better now than it was then. They spot a former Konoha Anbu, Minoichi, who went missing in the last war, after killing his unit. The three corner Minoichi and interrogate him, learning more of Gengo's ideology. Minoichi recognises Rō and puts him in a choke hold, hinting at his past, but Hinoko incapacitates him with her chakra needle. Rō wakes up after having nightmares about his past as a genin, when he survived the slaughter of his unit by burying himself in the corpses of his comrades and suppressing his chakra to appear dead. That night, Gengo appears for a public speech. Shikamaru wants to move closer to the stage so his jutsu can reach him, and Hinoko goes to a tower where she has a clear view of the entire crowd. During his speech, Gengo reveals a restrained Sai, and the crowd asks for his death. Gengo's words begin to affect the three of them.

A while later, Rō is tossed in a cell near Shikamaru, who asks if he is ok, and if Hinoko is with him. Gengo uses his jutsu on Hinoko. Shikamaru is taken to talk with Gengo, who has looked him up. Gengo tells Shikamaru how he perceives the current shinobi world, and how peace, as it exists, is forced by the great nations. Gengo shows him a flower that grows in the Land of Silence, that dies if taken out of its environment, and compares it to shinobi, who stop developing their skills in times of peace. Shikamaru notices that the flowers' scent stirs up unpleasant memories, which Gengo uses to turn shinobi to his side. Shikamaru asks for Rō and Hinoko, who are revealed to be the guards that brought him to the flowers, having been converted by Gengo. Shikamaru escapes the room. Shikamaru returns to Gengo's room, and fights Rō and Hinoko. He has Hinoko attack him with her chakra needles, and positions himself so they hit his ears, impairing his hearing so Gengo's voice can't affect him. Shikamaru almost reaches Gengo, but is stopped by Sai's ink lion. Gengo escapes, and Shikamaru is hit with a chakra needle on his head.

Sai isn't sure he can express himself in such a manner, but Sakura forces him to record a message as well. Sai struggles, coming off too stiff or too forced. Lee delivers a high-spirited message getting too close to the camera, Tenten finding it doesn't quite come across as congratulatory. Guy thinks there should be something symbolic onscreen, and suggests recording the message during the sunrise. Ino begins recording her message, but gets angry with Chōji and Shikamaru's comments. Akamaru suddenly topples her, and Kiba takes over the recording, sparking an argument with Ino. Konohamaru is bothered he can't seem to find someone to record a proper message. Konohamaru tries Iruka, who is very nervous, asks to postpone it so he can think of something to say. The next day, while trying to come up with something, Iruka finds Sadoru, a new Academy instructor, distressed by vandalism from students. He easily spots the perpetrators and when they try claiming they were just playing hide and seek, he tricks one of them into admitting to the vandalism, impressing Sadoru. Iruka comments that compared to Naruto, that was nothing. Sadoru is impressed, but the vandals think he's making it up, so Iruka adds to their punishment. Iruka reflects on how the village sees Naruto. Iruka is invited to take an exam for being vice-principal position in the Academy. Kakashi looks over the schedule for missions, seeing that if all of Naruto's friends go to the reception, there will be unfulfilled missions on the day. Konohamaru tries recording a message from Orochimaru, but Yamato covertly and emphatically tells him not to do it.

Konohamaru and Ebisu find Iruka at Ichiraku, and Ebisu gets self-conscious upon learning of Iruka's offer. Kakashi asks what's up, having been there for a while without being noticed. When they tell him about Iruka's possible promotion, he says it would be difficult. After he leaves, the others discuss what he meant. Iruka decides to take the exam for vice-principal, and his efforts are visible to all in Konoha. Tsukune, one of the vandals, steals the Scroll of Seals after learning Naruto did that. Kakashi almost explains what he meant in Ichiraku about Iruka, but Shizune tells him about the scroll's theft. Iruka finds Sansho and Mibuna, some of the vandals, who confirm his suspicion. He finds the vandal and the scroll at the Hokage Rock, and apologises for always comparing his students to previous students, realising he just wanted attention. The vandal promises to try harder. Kakashi shows Iruka the scroll just has an Icha Icha volume, as if he'd leave the scroll where someone could steal it so easily. He then explains that what he meant about the exam being difficult is that it's on the same day as Naruto's wedding, and considers moving the exam to another day, but Iruka decides not to take it, noting his failure to notice his current students. Kakashi decides to make getting a wedding gift for Naruto and Hinata a mission, so he can determine who should go to the wedding and who should be on mission duty on that day.\\n\"},\n",

Donning his damaged forehead protector and activating his dōjutsu, Boruto points out he is still a shinobi, and charges towards Kawaki. Boruto thinks back on his history, from a time he himself resented shinobi, more specifically his father, who he believed did not pay enough attention to his family on account of being Hokage. Boruto recalls a mission his team was assigned, subduing a bear. Upon reporting to Naruto, Katasuke interrupts them, asking Naruto's permission to allow the use of the Kote in the upcoming Chūnin Exams, which Naruto denies. Later, Katasuke provides Boruto with cheat codes for his video-game, and suggests the Chūnin Exams would be a way to show Naruto how strong he is. Elsewhere, Moegi hands her team admission papers to the exam. Shikadai and Inojin are not very excited about the idea, prompting her to deliver them letters from their mothers, which promptly changes their minds. Shikadai and Inojin meet with Boruto to play video-games. Sarada and Mitsuki join them, asking Boruto to participate in the Chūnin Exams, as it requires three-man teams. Shikadai notices Boruto's game has cheat codes, and leaves, believing the fun of the game being grinding for experience. Sarada and Mitsuki believe they convince Boruto to take the exams, when in reality, he wants to prove himself to his father. They are interrupted by Hinata and Himawari, who have groceries for Himawari's birthday party. Naruto joins them for the party, but at the last moment, Naruto drops the cake on the floor when the shadow clone is dispersed, angering Boruto. Hinata tries to defend Naruto's situation. Later, when the door bell rings, Boruto believes it to be Naruto, but actually it is Sasuke, looking for Naruto. Hinata informs him Naruto is still at the office. Sasuke hands Naruto a scroll from Kaguya's castle, and the two discuss Boruto. Later, Boruto tries attacking Sasuke, who effortlessly avoids it.

Sarada says she finds him annoying, and the other two gush about Naruto. Inojin bluntly says what everyone else is thinking about Boruto. Boruto extends his hand in friendship, but Inojin refuses, considering him to be untrustworthy. Sumire tries defusing the situation as Shino arrives at the classroom. During practice to assess everyone's strengths and weaknesses, Denki tells Boruto he got the second-best time. The one with the best time, Iwabee, isn't there.

Iwabee antagonizes Boruto over being the Hokage's son, seeing the current state of the Academy as being soft, despite having flunked twice. Denki speaks in Boruto's defence, and Iwabee targets him. Boruto stops Iwabee from hurting Denki. Despite promising himself he wouldn't fight, Boruto challenges Iwabē to a fight. The class watches nervously, while Inojin is amused. After talking with Anko, Shino arrives at an empty classroom, much to his confusion, as everyone ditched class to watch the fight. The class watches the two fighting, Iwabee even saying he won't use his weapon. Boruto and Iwabee are both impressed with each other's skills. Iwabee is frustrated he can't graduate only with shinobi related subjects. After a solid strike on him, Iwabee begins using Earth Release, creating an earth hammer.

Lee thinks he can deflect it, but with eyes on him, he falters, instead getting his foot stuck on the shuriken and getting dragged by it. Shikadai asks Boruto where he got a fūma shuriken, as they're not supposed to be using that yet. Boruto says he got it in a locker, which turn out to be Iwabee's.

Boruto gives chase, and finds the student knocked out by a young man, who notes Konoha to be rather rowdy. Later, Shino introduces the class to Mitsuki, the new student from Otogakure. The students discuss their new classmate among themselves, the boys about his skills, and the girls about his looks. Sumire asks the students not to talk over Shino. Mitsuki sits by Boruto, striking up a conversation. During class, Boruto solves a problem on the board with ease, surprising Iwabee. Shino tells Boruto to solve the problem as instructed, but Boruto prefers doing it his way, and mockingly asks for something more advanced. Shino gives him a much tougher problem to solve, and Boruto accuses him of being a sore loser. Mitsuki solves the problem, impressing the others. He and Shino briefly discuss if students should help each other or learn to solve problems by themselves. During sparring, Iwabee and Boruto are paired off, and Iwabee manages to best him. Afterwards, Mitsuki asks to fight Iwabee. As they spar, Mitsuki gets carried away, seriously choking him, despite Shino telling him to stop.

Denki asks to get rid of them, and Mitsuki obliges, using Wind Release to clear the insects, but ends up damaging the Academy even more. The students talk about Shino, unimpressed by him, which he overhears, getting him in a sullen mood. After first period, Shino asks for time off.

The boys discuss the recent lack of ghost incidents, and whether they should continue investigating now that they know the adults are also looking into it. Mitsuki asks Shikadai why he helped Denki, and Shikadai suggests Boruto got into him. Shino discusses the students with Moegi and Konohamaru. Moegi expresses interest in Iwabee and Boruto. Mitsuki notices Boruto helping Iwabee with arithmetic problems. Mitsuki asks him if he feels more included because of Boruto. After class, Inojin notes to Mitsuki he's been paying a lot of attention to Boruto. Inojin explains the lengths Boruto goes to not to be seen just as the Hokage's son. Mitsuki visits Sumire alone. He asks her how she feels about Boruto, and she echos Inojin's sentiment of finding him fun. She asks if Mitsuki has any family. Sumire explains all of her family is dead, that her panicked behaviour stems from not being as skilled as her father was, but that she grew to find class funny. Mitsuki questions her feelings about whoever injured her, and she just wants it to be over. Boruto has Mitsuki come over to his home for dinner. In Boruto's bedroom, Mitsuki questions the exact nature of how Boruto feels about Naruto, but Hinata calls them to dinner before he can answer. Naruto and Mitsuki are introduced to one another. At the Hokage's office, Shikamaru informs Naruto's clone that a chakra signature linked to the incidents has been detected, and that Sai has been dispatched to investigate. Naruto's clone disperses, and Naruto leaves dinner, causing Boruto to storm out. Naruto and Mitsuki exchange words. Boruto resents Naruto, because ever since becoming Hokage, he feels Naruto has neglected his family. Boruto explains that he is determined to never abandon those closest to him as he perceives Naruto to have done, doing something he couldn't do. This sparks a memory in Mitsuki, hearing his parent say something similar. Understanding Boruto better, Mitsuki confesses he knows who is behind the ghost incidents.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Sai investigates the hideout of Tanuki Shigaraki, a missing, former Root researcher who was an avid follower of Danzō, and in charge of developing a weapon based on Hashirama's cells code-named Gozu Tennō. Despite not finding him, Sai finds a picture of him with a little girl, and realises who the culprit is. Mitsuki reveals to Boruto that Sumire is the one behind the incidents. Shikamaru informs Naruto on Sai's discovery and current search for Sumire. He also informs Naruto complaints are being filed that the attacks continued to happen because the police force performed insufficient vetting of those involved. Kakashi arrives at the Hokage's Office, claiming responsibility for himself and Tsunade, having both decided not to expose the identities of everyone involved with Root. Despite Mitsuki's explanation of Sumire having interacted with each victim, Boruto is not convinced of her guilt. As Mitsuki explains the goal of the attacks was to absorb chakra from its victims, a rumble comes from Senju Park. Naruto, Shikamaru, and Kakashi discuss how to proceed, and how things would have happened if they had acted differently. Kakashi tells his investigation lead to the discovery that the Gozu Tennō has been embedded into Sumire's body. As Sai and company track Sumire down, he resolves not to let this incident be blamed on people with ties to Root. Knowing she has been discovered, Sumire thinks back to her father's words of getting revenge for Danzō and prepares to launch her last attack. Before she can, Sai apprehends her at the park, but she summons Nue before he can restrain her. As Boruto and Mitsuki spot the Nue from afar, Boruto decides to hear the truth from Sumire herself. After he leaves, Mitsuki is contacted through the white snake, and is tasked with eliminating Sumire. Kakashi arrives and severs a portion of Nue's snake tail. Sai distracts Nue with an ink bird, allowing Kakashi and other shinobi to raise walls around it. From its severed tail, several others sprout, chasing the Konoha shinobi, draining the chakra of those it can catch. Mitsuki tells Boruto that Nue will drain everyone in the village, and will only stop if the jutsu user dies. Boruto is determined to save both the village and Sumire. Mitsuki acknowledges that's an answer he would never give, and expresses interest in learning more about their differences. Mitsuki covertly creates a snake clone to restrain Boruto, and leaves to kill Sumire. Boruto manages to create a clone himself and knocks out Mitsuki's clone. Boruto's eye activates, allowing him to track Sumire through a chakra trail. The shinobi further limit Nue's movements with a barrier and wires. Naruto arrives intending to finish Nue in one blow, but Kakashi warns him it'll just absorb Naruto's chakra, and possibly detonate, as Nue was designed to be a suicide strategy. Mitsuki tracks Sumire, having put a white snake on her at the hospital. Though he manages to pin Sumire, Boruto's arrival lets her get out of Mitsuki's hold before he can end her. Sumire admits to being the culprit, having lived solely to carry out her father's revenge. Boruto stops Sumire and Mitsuki when they attack each other, and his eye lets off sparks. Nue transports itself out of the barrier to Sumire, and absorbs her to take her chakra. As it vanishes, Boruto jumps after it.\\n\"},\n",

Naruto, Sai, and Kakashi discuss finding the jutsu caster, who must be in another dimension as well. Denki, Shikadai, and Inojin look for Boruto. Shikadai notices something strange in the sky. In Nue's home dimension, Boruto follows a strand of dark chakra to a tree stump, where Nue attacks him. Boruto strikes back, managing to stab Nue in the face. Boruto can suddenly see Nue's chakra network, a spot at the base of its tail standing out. Nue attacks while Boruto is confused by what he sees, but Mitsuki saves him, and tells him Nue is attacking on Sumire's orders. Boruto has Mitsuki stall Nue, and prepares many explosive tag kunai. He stabs Nue at the base of its tail, and sets up the explosive tags, causing thick ropes above to fall on Nue. Mitsuki strikes the downed Nue with Lightning Release, but Sumire blocks it with her Water Release. Boruto and Mitsuki ask her if there's any chance she'll back down willingly. Sumire is baffled at them, and explains that despite her father serving the village, after the war, he was deemed a criminal for being involved with Root. All the fear and anxiety of living in hiding made her mother die of illness. Sumire exchanges attacks with Mitsuki. Boruto puts himself between them, telling to stop, and is injured. He is unconvinced that Sumire truly faked all her concern for her class mates since meeting her. Mitsuki is surprised by Boruto, and adds Sumire did mention wanting to end things quickly while in the hospital. Boruto sees the dark chakra's hold on her dissipating. Boruto deduces the reason why the ghost affected those who were troubled was because Sumire herself was troubled, making it easier to infect like-minded people. Sumire orders Nue to extract what's left of her chakra and blow itself up. Nue simply nudges her gently, Boruto concluding that despite being raised by Sumire to be a weapon, it sees her as its parent. Boruto tells her she doesn't have to use Nue as a weapon like her father used her. The Gozu Tennō on her back shatters, causing accumulated chakra to become unstable, and the place starts to cave in. The three rush to leave, and Nue protects them from the unstable chakra. Boruto manages to see where a rift is, and the three escape the dimension. Sai arrives with Konoha shinobi. He sympathises with Sumire, and offers to help her. She accepts. Boruto sees there is still a connection between her and Nue.

Shikamaru posits letting Sumire stay in the Academy might lead to problems. Shino informs his students they'll be assembled in new three person teams to see how well they fit after graduation. Sarada questions Sumire's prolonged absence. Mitsuki insists on partnering with Boruto again, but they lack a third member, as Iwabee and Denki are already partners, as are Shikadai, Chōchō, and Inojin. Iwabee already asked Sarada to be on his team, Boruto considers asking Lee, and Mitsuki wishes Sumire could be on theirs. Boruto shushes him, as others don't know about Sumire's involvement in the incidents. Shino asks Iruka what will happen with Sumire, and insists he will watch over her if she returns. Boruto is surprised to see Naruto home early. They discuss Sumire. Shino visits Sumire, and offers to set up a place outside the village where she can figure herself out. Inojin tells Shikadai and Denki his father got files on other villages' academies, and figures Sumire is being transferred. Shino has the students catch a flag again. He steps out when he receives words about Sumire. With Mitsuki's help, Boruto is able to get to the flag. Sumire returns, and is moved by everyone's reaction. Naruto sends a shadow clone to meet up with Sasuke, and hands him a scroll about the Gozu Tennō, which Sasuke attributes to Kaguya, and believes will make it easier to reach her dimension.

Denki is distressed as this is the first time he hasn't been able to pass a test, and fears repeating the Academy like Iwabee, leading to awkwardness when Iwabee hears him. Denki keeps trying to climb the wall later, and is approached by Metal, who offers to help him train. Metal takes him rock climbing. Denki loses his footing, but Rock Lee catches him when he falls. Iwabee struggles with arithmetic, despite having help from Boruto. Inojin and Shikadai conclude Denki would be a better teacher, but find it unlikely Iwabee would consider learning from him after his earlier comment. Denki spends the day failing at climbing with Metal and Rock Lee. Iwabee receives a low test score, and notices Denki still trying to climb the wall. Iwabee offers him advice on how to climb the wall, and Denki improves. Later, Denki asks why Iwabee helped him, despite his earlier comment. Iwabee lost all his friends when they graduated without him, and he doesn't wish that on others. Denki offers to tutor him, but Iwabee claims to be studying as well. Denki sees his low test score, and Iwabee confesses he doesn't want Denki to tutor him if it will interfere with Denki's own training. Denki reveals that meeting Boruto has changed his opinion on ninjutsu, now wanting be a shinobi just like them, and with Iwabee as well. The two decide to help each other out. When Iwabee struggles with studying, Denki decides to have him study while infusing chakra to stick to the ceiling, as his concentration improves when doing that. On the day of the test, Denki and Iwabee come by a building on fire. Iwabee goes in when he hears a woman despairing about her children in the building. Denki figures a building like that should have a sprinkler system, and finds it unusual it's not activating. Iwabee has to block an exit so the fire won't reach him and the children, and starts working on a wire box. At the Academy, Boruto worries about the two not showing up. Worried about Iwabee, Denki climbs the side of the building and enters through a window. He finds Iwabee's Earth Release wall, just as Iwabee finishes fixing the sprinkler system. The two take the children and climb down the side of the building. Boruto asks Shino to wait for Denki and Iwabee. The two arrive late. At Shino's office they explain why they were late. Shino decides they won't take the test, as tests are used to make sure they have the skills and knowledge for when something real happens, which they just did, prioritising human lives over a test.

She declines, having to prepare dinner, and chides them for riding the top of the train. At home, Sarada prepares soup as Sakura arrives. The following day, Sarada hands Sakura her vacation trip schedule as she finishes packing. Sakura asks if Sarada wants her to bring anything, but Sarada tells her not to waste her money. Sakura notices a teddy bear that was supposed to have been picked up for one of her patients is still there. As she has no time to deliver it, Sarada offers to take it. At the train, Sarada gets distracted reading a note from her mother, and forgets the teddy bear on the train when she gets off. Though she is desperate to catch the train, Sarada is mortified at the thought of jumping across the roofs like Boruto. Shizune spots her, the two exchange words, and Sarada leaves. Meanwhile, the boys are unsuccessful catching any fish, and Boruto resolves to find a better fishing spot. Sarada rushes to the next station, but has to help an old lady buy her ticket and misses it.

Chōchō takes her to the lost and found, where she collects a package, but they discover it's not the same package, despite similar wrappings, and that the other package has already been claimed. Chōchō takes her to a marketplace where they sell products from other villages, and has a shopkeeper identify the doll they have as a Takigakure doll, which they send down the river in a ceremony for their ancestors. As payment, Chōchō gives up rare flavoured chips from her personal stash. As part of their trip, Ino takes Sakura to where she had her first date with Sasuke.

The next morning, Boruto jumps on him to wake him up when Himawari is unable to do it. Hinata leaves to pick up Naruto's formal wear, as the seamstress, who made the formal attire of every previous Hokage, still isn't done with it. At the inauguration venue, Kakashi expresses relief at passing on the mantle of Hokage. Hinata arrives, but Naruto hasn't, so she goes back home to check on him. At home, Boruto and Himawari fight over a teddy bear and end up tearing it apart. Himawari, angered beyond reason, awakens her Byakugan, and moves in to attack Boruto. Seeing a terrified Boruto, Naruto puts himself between them, getting himself knocked out. At the inauguration, Kakashi and Shikamaru have Konohamaru transform into Naruto to get the event underway; down in the crowd, only Iruka sees through the ruse. Hinata finds Naruto unconscious at home with his tenketsu closed, and wonders who might have done it. Upstairs, Himawari finds Boruto hidden in a closet.

When he learns of her goal to be Hokage, he declares her to be a rival. He also tells her that Boruto's bratty behaviour and disdain for the Hokage title is due to his desire to be seen as more than Naruto's son. Understanding Boruto better, Sarada resolves to make him outgrow his childishness. In a closed meeting, Naruto informs the other Kage on recent events, and the presence of other dimensions in them. He tells them that Kaguya created White Zetsu before the war, in preparation for a great enemy. The other Kage worry about when the next enemy will come, concerned about the lack of fighting skill in the next generation. Gaara says that has always been a concern, and that the new generation will eventually rise up to surpass them. While gazing at the Hokage Rock, she spots Boruto on his way to vandalise it. Naruto says the current generation can depend on their friends to fight and hone their skills, at the same time Sarada and Boruto spar. Sarada impresses Boruto enough for him to end the fight, but he still vandalises the rocks, causing Naruto to be notified, getting exasperated.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto interrupts their discussions with a poor rendition of Wind Release jutsu. Boruto tries talking around the issue. Boruto and Naruto get into an argument. Shino announces the development to his class. The students discuss the possibilities. Shino asks for a class leader to represent them, and Sarada volunteers Boruto, who is hanging upside down tied up and gagged over his earlier prank. Other students support her, and due to being gagged, Boruto is unable to voice his dissent. While talking about it after class, Iwabee reminds them of Kirigakure\\'s past as the \"Bloody Mist\".

He introduces them to Mei, the previous Mizukage, and lists her previous efforts during the war and in beginning Kirigakure's expansion. The two lead them to the Mizukage's office, where they meet Chōjūrō. Boruto is bored as Chōjūrō makes a lengthy speech about cooperation. Sarada discreetly calls him out on it, but Chōjūrō does concede long speeches are boring. As the group leaves, Chōjūrō asks if Kagura will give something another try, wanting to groom Kagura for something in the future. Kagura politely declines, and hurries along to the group. Mitsuki tells the group what he knows about Kagura, and when Boruto is unfamiliar with the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, Shikadai tells him about them. Kagura takes them to visit Kirigakure's Academy, where students practice kenjutsu on water. Chōjūrō invites Boruto to spar, and has Kagura be his partner. Boruto takes his time making a first move, unable to find an opening. Despite making a feint with the water, Boruto loses when Kagura disarms him. Iwabee can't watch and leave, and Kagura is distraught by having to fight, but composes himself. Boruto asks hims about it, but Kagura changes the subject when students talk about the possibility of him becoming Mizukage. He then takes them to visit the beaches. Kagura talks to Boruto and Sarada how Chōjūrō improved the quality of life in Kirigakure. At the end of the day, Kagura takes them to a memorial for those who died during the era of the Bloody Mist. Iwabee reveals his grandfather was killed by the Fourth Mizukage, who had the same last name as Kagura. Iwabee is irritated by Kagura apologising for something that happened when he wasn't there. Some Kirigakure villagers who dislike outsiders come by, led by Hachiya, and tensions rise as they talk down to Kagura. They also disrespect Boruto on account of being an Uzumaki. Hachiya tries stabbing them, but is stopped by Kagura. Iwabee attacks him with an earth spear, but they escape. Kagura is unconcerned with the wound in his hand, and Sumire tends to his injury. Hachiya and his group report to Shizuma, who orders them to engage the outsiders again, and expresses interest in Kagura's response. Later, Denki wanders off at night after buying vintage electronics, and is kidnapped. A message is delivered to Boruto, telling him where to go to find Denki. Denki learns from his kidnappers that he's bait for Boruto, who have to defeat up to save their reputation.\\n\"},\n",

Kagura tells them Tsurushi Hachiya, a genin from his class who dislikes the current state of Kirigakure, is most likely responsible. Kagura wants to inform Chōjūrō, but Boruto doesn't want the field trip to be cancelled, so he and the others convince Kagura to handle the situation himself with their help. The two groups meet, and fighting ensues. Tsurushi erects a barrier to ensure no one outside notice the fight and interfere. Boruto and his friends make short work of Tsurushi's group. Tsurushi dares Kagura to draw his blade, revealing he killed while in the Academy, and exposing him as the Fourth Mizukage's grandson. Tsuruchi trips Kagura with wire, distracting Boruto, who himself gets lifted by the neck by another of Tsurushi's friends. He frees himself with a failed attempt at Mitsuki's Wind Release technique. Kagura deals with Tsurushi, despite using a wooden sword against his metal one. Iwabee finishes Tsurushi off, and the mist barrier clears. Hachiya's group retreats, and Boruto's frees Denki. Back at the hotel, Kagura confirms he is Yagura's grandson, and that since killing classmates when he was in the Academy, he has struggled with being in control when wielding a sword. Elsewhere, Shino, Anko, and Mei discuss a treaty between the Lands of Fire, Water, Waves, and the Sea. When Mei drinks too much, uses chakra control to lower her alcohol levels. Getting back to business, Mei explains that Kirigakure wants the Land of Water to sign the treaty. However, the Land itself is opposed, counting on the instability to amass influence, and fearful that the continued expansion of the neighbouring nations will endanger them. If conflict ensues, the Land of Fire will also have to get involved. Back at the hotel, Boruto invites Kagura to play cards with them. Kagura gets into it, and realises they invited him to get his mind off the earlier talk about him and his grandfather, for which he is thankful. Kagura tells them about his struggle with himself, of having killed his friends at the Academy, and feeling guilt for Yagura's sins. The others try talking him out of it. Partially successful, Kagura lightens up as he wins a match. Sarada comes in, telling Boruto he has to do a roll call. Boruto gives Kagura the card game they were playing as a gift. The next day, Kagura asks Chōjūrō to take a test to claim Hiramekarei. Tsurushi reports the meeting to Shizuma, who despite claiming it to be fine, seemingly kills the former.\\n\"},\n",

After the revolution is done, Shizuma plans to install Kagura as Mizukage, so Yagura's blood would rule over Kirigakure again, as a place that accepts him. Chōjūrō and Mei examine their message left over the vault. Chōjūrō deduces Shizuma coaxed Kagura into giving them the key to the vault. He decides to impose a gag order on the situation, and have them executed should they attack villagers. Boruto and Sarada reach Chōjūrō and Mei, and Boruto tells him Kagura went along with the plan so he'd be spared. Chōjūrō states that as a shinobi, Kagura knows the consequences of breaking the rules. Boruto suggests they downplay the situation to an incident between kids who don't know better. When Mei expresses disagreement, he implies he'll play up the injury he sustained from Shizuma to stir a diplomatic incident. Chōjūrō agrees to let them handle it, on the condition he accompanies them, and that they resolve the situation within a time limit. Shizuma and Buntan think fondly of the upcoming conflict. Kagura dreads what he might have to do should Boruto interfere. Iwabee goes for a walk after he and Denki notice Boruto's absence during the day.

Iwabee finds and presses on Tsurushi for information. Meanwhile, Mitsuki tells  Suigetsu he knows he's been followed. Suigetsu passes on instructions for Mitsuki not to get further involved so Kirigakure doesn't learn of the connection between them. Suigetsu dislikes having to stay hidden after being away from home for so long, and decries the new group calling themselves swordsmen despite having no war experience. Mitsuki decides to do as he pleases. Shikadai and Inojin watch the exchange, but are discovered by Suigetsu.

Kyohō misses his attack, Chōjūrō goads Hassaku into attacking him, using the attack to cut some of the wires holding him in place, allowing him to grab his own sword and cut the rest. Ichirōta watches it and comments from afar. Sarada blocks another of Buntan's attacks, and causes her to retreat to avoid genjutsu. Buntan remotely controls Kiba to attack Sarada. As she dodges the swords, Sarada notices water around. Creating a Lightning Fish, Buntan limits Sarada's mobility to small rocks in the water, and continues attacking from a distance, so Sarada can't read her hand seals.

Boruto reminds Kagura what he said about being the only one who decides how he lives, and Kagura responds that he's there because Shizuma acknowledged him. Boruto is unconvinced due to Kagura's expression. Boruto feints with three clones and distracts Kagura using his jacket, landing a hit. Boruto continues to dodge and block Kagura's attacks. Shizuma interrupts their fight, and begins swaying Kagura again, but Boruto argues that Chōjūrō wouldn't have given him Hiramekarei if he thought he was what Shizuma claims he is. Shizuma claims Chōjūrō has secretly assassinated all those opposing him, and that he'll create a just future by hiding nothing and exposing everything. Mitsuki arrives and shows everyone the scroll Suigetsu gave him, with intel revealing that his high echelon associates, who have secretly been dealing with the Land of Waves, have just confessed to having their opponents assassinated. Shizuma is unconcerned about it, as he just wants the return of the Bloody Mist regardless. Shizuma didn't expect Kagura to follow him so far along his plans. When Mitsuki asks him about his motives, Shizuma reveals that he wants war because he finds it funny. Using his own blood and Samehada, Shizuma turns the mist around them red. Mitsuki and Boruto attack Shizuma, pushing him back slightly, until Shizuma absorbs Mitsuki's Wind Release with Samehada, causing its scales to rip through the bandages. They also learn that Samehada is also absorbing their chakra from their wounds through the red mist. Boruto attacks with clones, and Mitsuki manages to get close enough to cut Shizuma's throat, but it's only a water clone. The deception lets the real Shizuma pin Mitsuki down with water spikes, but Mitsuki manages to avoid a fatal hit with Wind Release. Though alive, Mitsuki is exhausted, so Shizuma turns his attention to Boruto. Shizuma finds it a waste that Kagura won't kill Boruto. Mitsuki draws Samehada's attention with a shadow clone, while Boruto and his own clones propel him forward with Wind Release, landing a powerful hit and disarming him in the process. Shizuma comes at Boruto with a water sword, but Kagura blocks it, asking Shizuma to stop. Shizuma reconnects with Samehada, which begins turning him into a shark-like monster.

Inojin deduces Sai knows why his jutsu is failing, but Sai is certain him just telling Inojin the reason won't fix it.

Boruto is unconcerned, and Kakashi arrives, revealing himself to be the exam's proctor, intending not to let any troublemaker become a shinobi. Kakashi has a single bell the students have to take from him, implying only one of them will graduate. Kakashi gives them the signal but Boruto attacks using kunai and Kakashi reveals its a wood. Kakashi remarks that Boruto is similar to Naruto and they give the go. Various students take different approaches. Some go after Kakashi directly, others are staying back a bit to let others act as distractions, Shikadai planted a tracker on Kakashi, but Shino uses a bug to remove the tracker. Anko uses genjutsu to make a couple teams go round in circles, and prepares to fight Shikadai, Inojin, and Chōchō. Konohamaru knocks out Renga, Tsuru, and Hako along with Namida and Wasabi. Boruto doesn't want to waste time on Konohamaru, and Sarada allows him to go straight for Kakashi, believing there's a reason to go after Konohamaru first. Boruto and Mitsuki are blocked by Shino, who Mitsuki decides to deal with. Boruto searches for Kakashi from a giant tree, and baits him with a shadow clone. Anko uses snakes against Shikadai, Inojin, and Chōchō, but the students she had caught in genjutsu show up, having broken free. Mitsuki prepares to go all about against Shino. Sarada and Sumire use the Sharingan and Nue against Konohamaru. Boruto uses shadow clones against Kakashi. Mitsuki defeats Shino, who tells him to go ahead. Kakashi considers Boruto to be a cut above the rest, but still unsuitable to be a shinobi for lacking one decisive trait. Boruto baits Kakashi with a Boruto Stream while coming from below ground, but Kakashi substitutes away. Kakashi considers Boruto to have chūnin level skills, and pins him down after sneaking behind him with genjutsu, considering this to be the end of the line for Boruto.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Kakashi has Boruto pinned down in a way that would require Boruto to break his own arm to break free. He admonishes Boruto's lack of resolve and motivation to change, and reveals his Sukea disguise. Kakashi believes Boruto's influence on his classmates to have made them unsuitable to become shinobi. Mitsuki and Iwabee attack Kakashi, forcing him to let go of Boruto to defend himself and counterattack, allowing Boruto to escape with Iwabee's help. At night, several of the students gather, Wasabi healing Boruto, and Boruto wishing she'd look after Mitsuki, who was injured by Kakashi. Boruto tells them of Kakashi's assessment of their class and Boruto's influence and apologises. Iwabee aggressively tells Boruto he made it this far because of Boruto, something he intends telling Kakashi. Denki and Sumire share Iwabee's opinion. Mitsuki also tells Boruto that by watching him, he learned to do things for other people, by his own volition. The group takes notice of the 24 hour limit, that they still have their bandannas despite some of them having been knocked unconscious before, and that while injured, the teachers have not given pursuit. Boruto determines the exam to be a test of their resolve: the targets, bandannas, and the bell hide the real test, namely how they choose to tackle the problem. Kakashi, Anko, and Konohamaru discuss the exams while watching over captured students, saying the class will fail if they don't come to rescue them.\\n\\nBoruto formulates a strategy. As the fastest in the class, Metal and Wasabi will distract Anko, while Sumire has Nue, under the cover of several smoke bombs, stealthily equip the captured students with earplugs as Namida also sneaks in. The Anko they fight turns out to be a clone, but the real one gets knocked out by the frightened Namida with a sonic scream. They finish freeing the captive students. Boruto distracts Konohamaru, allowing Denki, Iwabee, and Mitsuki to lock them in place with fūinjutsu, almost suffering a heavy hit from Sarada. Konohamaru stops a punch from Denki at his target, but it gets hit anyway. Sarada and Boruto had transformed into one another, allowing Sarada to get close enough to cast Sharingan genjutsu on him not to notice Denki's kunai in his fist. Tsuru arrives, telling them only Kakashi remains. At sunrise, Boruto attacks Kakashi with shadow clones, but more appear than Boruto is able to use. His classmates are disguised as Boruto's clones. Kakashi knocks them down as well, but when Boruto gets close enough and signals it, they all hold Kakashi down with fūinjutsu, as they did with Konohamaru. When Boruto gets too close to the bell, Kakashi uses Lightning Release against them, but they don't fall back. Boruto only manages to ring the bell before the 24 hours are up. Kakashi passes them all. They're all confused, as they didn't get the bell. Kakashi explains they wouldn't have been able to acquire the bell at all. He explains that in the shinobi world, those who break the rules are called scum, but those who don't value their comrades are worse, and when they all came together at him as a team, that's when they passed. Shino congratulates them, and releases the transformation on their bandannas, which were forehead protectors all along. The students celebrate. Iruka scolds Kakashi for being too rough on the students.\\n\"},\n",

Shikamaru drops by Naruto's house to inform him of his various duties of the day. At the Academy, the genin discuss and wonder how they'll be group in teams. When Namida warns everyone Shino is arriving, Iwabee's sudden movement causes him to bump into Boruto, knocking him into Sarada, almost kissing her by accident, but she blocks him with her foot. Shino arrives and after a brief explanation on three-man teams, Shino begins informing the genin their teams. Denki, Metal, and Iwabee are Team 5, Wasabi, Sumire and Namida are Team 15, Hōki, Hako, and Renga are Team 25, Enko, Dōshu, and Tsuru are Team 40. Inojin, Chōchō, and Shikadai are Team 10 much like their parents were, leaving Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki as Team 3. Sarada questions being in the same team as Boruto, as while she acknowledges his skill, she doesn't feel they're compatible, putting the team's teamwork in question. Sarada feels she can't afford to take detours from her goal of becoming Hokage. Konohamaru informs her she can appeal the decision to the Hokage. After the genin leave, Konohamaru and Shino discuss how requests for changing teams have never been approved. Boruto and Sarada arrive at the Hokage's office, but Shikamaru informs them Naruto is out on business, and he can't disclose his location. In the interest of finding Naruto, Boruto and Sarada call a truce. Mitsuki arrives with a copy of Naruto's schedule, having taken a look when Shikamaru was distracted with Boruto and Sarada. Elsewhere, Naruto tests some shinobi's ability to protect the village by having them restrain him with a barrier, which he easily overcomes. Shikamaru checks who is the Hokage's escort for the day, to inform them of Boruto and Sarada, and is amused to learn who it is. Mirai is notified about Boruto and Sarada. She refuses to let the three through. Mirai cuts the support ropes for the bridge they're crossing, but Mitsuki uses snakes to secure it. While Boruto fights Mirai, Sarada observes her with the Sharingan, looking for a vulnerability. Mirai notices Sarada's Sharingan, and traps her in genjutsu, requiring Boruto to snap her out of it. Mirai successfully repels them. Boruto and Sarada argue. Konohamaru arrives and comments on Mirai's strength. Mitsuki tells Boruto and Sarada they're trying too hard to be compatible, and in doing so, are not making the most of their individual skills. Boruto is too concerned with what Sarada will do, and Sarada is over-relying on her Sharingan. Boruto goes at Mirai with shadow clones, but keeps some hidden under the bridge. Sarada uses shuriken to distract Mirai, and notices the damage done by Mirai's chakra blades on the deflected shuriken. She uses shuriken to distract Mirai, allowing Boruto to knock her off-balance in a section of the bridge she damaged, where a hidden shadow clone pulls her off the bridge. Konohamaru compliments them, and after pointing out the value of hard-earned cooperation, asks Sarada if she'd still like to request another team. Sarada changes her mind about the team, but would still like to request Naruto something else. Naruto informs the shinobi he's training they must be prepared to protect Konoha from attacks at any moment. The genin and Konohamaru arrive, and Sarada requests Naruto for them to have the Team 7 designation, which Naruto grants.\\n\"},\n",

He tells her he's happy doing whatever Boruto is doing, prompting her to ask if he does something of his own will. He explains he chose that of his own will, and thinks back to his past. He remembers waking up under Orochimaru's care, and dropping a cup of medicine when taking it. Orochimaru instructs Suigetsu to escort him when he's fully awake. Mitsuki has no memory of who he was. Orochimaru comments to a hooded individual this is the sixth time something had happened. Mitsuki asks Suigetsu why he was in bed. Suigetsu answers he was injured in a mission with Orochimaru, figuring he doesn't remember the bad parts. Suigetsu suddenly attacks Mitsuki, who immobilises him. Mitsuki almost stabs Suigetsu with the kunai taken from him, but blocks it with his arm when Suigetsu commends him. Suigetsu comments his body remembers he is a shinobi, and breaks free of Mitsuki's hold by liquefying his arm. He explains Mitsuki was captured and had his memories erased, and that Orochimaru would have been disappointed had his abilities also been erased. Suigetsu takes Mitsuki to Orochimaru, who introduces himself as Mitsuki's parent. He explains a certain shinobi they call Log has stolen his memories, and they have to retrieve them. Mitsuki asks why they were after him in the first place, and Orochimaru explains he wants the intel Log has acquired, which is why he has to be taken alive. He dismisses Mitsuki's concern about his memories also being altered, and his question of which parent Orochimaru is. Mitsuki just wants to know who he is. They go after Log. Orochimaru has Mitsuki disrupt Log's barrier, which Log detects. They meet Log, who intended to go after them himself. He tries paralysing them, but it only works on Mitsuki. Log and Orochimaru battle, their speed impressing Mitsuki. Orochimaru attempts to use snakes to poison him, but his armour blocks their fangs. Log uses a jutsu to have his armour cover Orochimaru and hold him in place. Orochimaru tells Mitsuki he can use senjutsu. Log moves in to strike Mitsuki, but is paralysed himself with the venom of a small snake Orochimaru managed to slip through the gaps of his armour. Orochimaru tasks Mitsuki with watching over Log while he goes in search of something. Log asks Mitsuki to take off his mask, and tells him Orochimaru is deceiving him. Mitsuki removes Log's mask, revealing him to be an older version of Mitsuki. Log explains they're both synthetic humans created by Orochimaru. He goes on to say the thing Orochimaru is after is the original source from which both of them were cultured, that he had stolen, but couldn't destroy, as Orochimaru held the key to open its container. Log wants to destroy it as it was created by Orochimaru's narcissism and greed, saying that when he escaped Orochimaru, he just created another. Log wants to destroy Orochimaru. Orochimaru returns, and says the manner of their creation is irrelevant, and that he loves them the same. Orochimaru and Log each press on their opinion onto Mitsuki, causing him to snap and activate his Sage Transformation, stating that as a child, he is not interested in what they, the adults think. He takes the container and the key and leaves. Orochimaru comments Mitsuki's achievement with Log, revealed to be the hooded individual Orochimaru talked to earlier. Orochimaru is glad that on the sixth try, Mitsuki was able to make his own decision, not wanting to erase his memory again for a seventh. Orochimaru hopes that by find a sun who will show Mitsuki the light, Mitsuki himself can be a moon that illuminates the darkness. Inside the container, Mitsuki finds a photo of Boruto. In the present, Boruto arrives, and the three leave for a mission.\\n\"},\n",

When Konohamaru explains that as new shinobi fresh from the Academy, they'll only receive low-rank missions at first. Boruto thinks they should just get those missions over with, so they can get higher ranked missions. Naruto overhears him and says no missions is something one just get over with. Their first mission is to expel bandits from a small village called Green Banks. Due to a drought, both Green Banks and neighboring farming villages have had poor harvests, and Green Banks is having its food stolen from storehouses. Boruto still thinks the mission to be easy, and when Konohamaru says the team should take the assignment more seriously, angering Sarada for lumping her with Boruto. Naruto tells them that even as a D rank mission, it is important and that they should give it their all. At home, Boruto asks Hinata about her first mission. She recalls being nervous back then, as there were wars, and missions were more dangerous. She tells him his first mission isn't really something to be excited about. Team 7 departs for their mission. Naruto tells Shikamaru he has filled Konohamaru in on the details of the mission and remembers Shikadai is also having his first mission. His mission is to escort a rich lady around. Shikadai and Inojin carry her purchases, while Chōchō engages in conversation with her. On the way to Green Banks, Sarada tells Boruto not to do anything that would reflect poorly on her record, as not to hinder her path to becoming Hokage. As the two bicker, Mitsuki comments they get along well; angering both. Konohamaru stresses the importance of what Naruto told them and adds that they should not try resolving things on their own. A rustle nearby gets the genin on edge, but it's just a wild boar, and Konohamaru comments they have a long way to go if they get startled so easily. They reach a suspended bridge to Green Banks and ring a bell to announce themselves. Kiri sees they're children and doubts their skills, but lowers the bridge nonetheless. Team 7 is informed of the recent passing of the previous village leader around the time the attacks started, and that his daughter has taken over his position. They're introduced to Kiri, who informs them that as they've been able to deal with bandits on their own for a while, other villages have also hired shinobi. Konohamaru asks the genin to speak with Kiri in private. Konohamaru tells Kiri that conflict with other shinobi would make it at least a B rank mission, which he believes the genin are not prepared for. While the three discuss the implications of not completing the mission, they hear a commotion, find an enemy shinobi has killed a villager and Boruto engages in combat. Konohamaru interferes when Boruto is attacked, and Ashimaru is told to retreat. Konohamaru tells Kiri to be honest with them, as they can't make a strategy without knowing that the other village is really after. Kiri reveals they want the deed to the bridge. The enemy shinobi are informed about Konoha's involvement. At night, they attack again by setting one of the houses on fire. Boruto saves a villager from being attacked and other villagers start attacking them. Konohamaru determines they're being controlled with genjutsu. The villager Boruto saved holds Kiri hostage. Sarada tries locating the genjutsu user with her Sharingan, but fails. Mitsuki uses his Wind Release to knock down the controlled villagers, figuring anyone strong enough to resist it should be the enemy shinobi. All the villagers are knocked down, and Boruto notices Kiri has been taken, determining the one who got her must be working with the enemy. Konohamaru scolds Boruto for acting on his own without warning.\\n\"},\n",

Konohamaru confirms the involvement of Pale Blue Valley hired shinobi when a ransom note demands the bridge's deed in exchange for Kiri's life. With Kiri in captivity, Iori confesses to be working for the Pale Blue Valley, having done so since killing her father. He was offered a lot of money for the bridge deed, and counted on Kiri to fail by trying to resolve the issue all by herself, but didn't count on her hiring Konoha shinobi. The Green Banks villagers offer Konohamaru the deed, and ask the team to save Kiri. Team Konohamaru plans on how to rescue her. Iori delivers Kiri to Hidari, and is killed by Ashimaru, telling him they're former shinobi. Hidari proposes trading Kiri for the deed to Konohamaru. Konohamaru makes the trade, but Hidari tries disposing of him with an explosive tag left on Iori's corpse. Hidari and Ashimaru attack Konohamaru, who tosses Kiri aside for Boruto to catch. Konohamaru insists the genin to take Kiri away while he deals with Hidari and Ashimaru. Hidari manages to immobilise Konohamaru with a trap, and sends Ashimaru to deal with the genin. They stop and set up traps so they can tend to Kiri's injury. Kiri explains how her need to do things alone stems from having to live up to her father's reputation. Ashimaru catches up to them, and they decide to fight him. Hidari goes in to kill Konohamaru, who forcefully dispels his jutsu with a Wind Release: Rasengan. Konohamaru deliberately misses his attack, and Hidari faints in disbelief of the damage. Mitsuki and Boruto engage Ashimaru while Sarada analyses him with her Sharingan. She determines Ashimaru doesn't bother dodging attacks, just blocking them and counterattacking. Boruto and Mitsuki employ Wind Release to send Sarada towards Ashimaru at high speeds, her Sharingan allowing her to read his attacks, avoiding his counterattack and landing her own finishing blow. Konohamaru catches up with them, deed in hand. They return Kiri and the deed to Green Banks, where Kiri apologises for trying to take everything on her own. Back at Konoha, Konohamaru reports to Naruto. Boruto talks with Shikadai, Iwabee, and Denki about their first missions.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto voices his displeasure with the simple, neighbourhood based missions they've been assigned so far. Sarada points out those are the missions usually assigned to genin. At the mission assignment desk, Boruto requests a flashier mission. Konohamaru points out that Boruto probably got the wrong impression about missions, since missions with combat against other shinobi, like his first mission, are very rare in times of peace. Konohamaru points out their former classmates are also doing similarly low-key missions, and adds that through these missions, they get to learn about the village. Boruto asks if Naruto fed him that line. A news report informs them that an armed robbery was stopped by Kiba and Rock Lee. Boruto buys a newly released game, a sequel to a game he really likes, and offers to teach Mitsuki so they can play together. Sarada informs Boruto and Mitsuki they've been summoned by Konohamaru to deal with a bank robber, which sparks Boruto's interest. Boruto is disappointed by the scene at the bank. They're greeted by captain Kōtarō Fūma of the police force, who is in charge of the situation. There are no hostages, and their mission is to talk the robber out of exploding himself along with the bank. Despite being disappointed by the situation, Boruto is still committed to finish the mission. He goes inside the bank by himself, trying to act as a negotiator, and then as a hostage for the robber, all the while noting the robbers ineptitude. Boruto doesn't find Haguruma to be someone who would rob a bank, and Haguruma tells him how he was fired from his job. He was a game programmer, and after he and his team had to deal with an unforgiving schedule, they decided to file a complaint against their boss. The boss somehow learned of it, and fabricated evidence that Haguruma was selling company secrets to rivals, leading to his firing. After being made an example for the other employees, no other company would hire him, and with no income, his debts piled up. Boruto identifies with Haguruma when he mentions not longer caring about the job since others didn't know what befell him. Haguruma feels better having told Boruto his story, and activates the bomb. He feels blowing himself up the day the last game he worked on is released will be a good final protest against his boss. Boruto reveals he just bought the game, and that he was a great fan of the first one. Boruto's passion for the games moves Haguruma, who gives up blowing himself up. When he can't deactivate the bomb because of issues with the trigger, Boruto instead fries the device with Lightning Release. Boruto comes out of the bank with Haguruma. At the police station, the captain informs the team that after seeing that the device would not have caused any casualties, and that Haguruma was under extreme emotional duress, his punishment is not likely to be severe. When Mitsuki asks what Haguruma will do now, Boruto asks Denki to find him a job at his family's company. Captain Kōtarō informs Konohamaru that someone instigated Haguruma into barricading himself in the bank. Just then, a fellow officer gives him surprising news.

Outside the vault, Sarada finds a frozen flower. Five days go by without any developments. Denki explains to Boruto that noble thieves steal from the rich to give to the poor. Boruto asks Shikadai his opinion on it, and is surprised when Shikadai answers they must have their reasons, as there is more to what they know and learned in the Academy. Their talk is keeping Shikadai from understanding a shōgi strategy he's studying. Sarada makes a breakthrough on the case, and informs Boruto and Mitsuki on her theory on an Ice Release user, who would have brought their body temperature down as not to trigger the thermal sensors. At Boruto's suggestion, they don't report their findings so as to be kept in the loop of the investigation. Boruto takes them to Katasuke to find out more about Ice Release without alerting the investigation. Shikadai saves a child from injuring himself too seriously when playing with explosive tags, and a bystander picks up a shōgi piece he drops. Katasuke confirms their Ice Release theory, and shows them a more clandestine side of Konoha where they might find the Byakuya Gang. They find a posting about selling the stolen jewels. Shikadai still struggles with the shōgi strategy, and the bystander returns him the shōgi piece. The two talk and play shōgi for hours.

Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki meet with the thief, pretending to be a buyer. The thief they're meeting is a decoy, rigged with explosive tags. The real thief questions their allegiance to the rich, considering them to be thieves themselves. He uses the jewel for a distraction to flee, but leaves them a trail of frozen footprints to follow. They follow the footprints to a water system by a mountain side, and up the mountain side to an impoverished village. The thief traps them with ice, and reveals the jewel was already sold, its profit used to fix the water system for the village. Boruto doesn't pursue the thief when he frees them, and later is conflicted about the case. The thief reports to a partner, who says another plan is already set up. The thief leaves for guard duty.

Iwabee pursues them as they flee, and blocks their escape with earth walls. However, they easily break free, and Metal is injured while protecting Denki from an icicle. At the hospital, Udon lectures Iwabee and tells him to stay home. They watch news reports on the Byakuya Gang, and see they are well-received by poorer populations.

Boruto goes check the situation with his friends. Shikadai acts detached from the situation when asked about it, confusing the others. Ryōgi thinks back to how he came to be part of the Byakuya Gang. One day, his father returned home fatally injured from a mission. When Ryōgi's mother tried to help, she was also killed in front of him. The assailant tried attacking Ryōgi, who tapped into his Ice Release abilities to stop him before passing out. When he woke up, Gekkō told him he killed the man who attacked him, and that the funeral for his parents was over. Gekkō offered to teach Ryōgi, who accepted the offer. Gekkō introduced Ryōgi to the Byakuya Gang, claiming it to be the real job he and his father did besides shinobi work. Gekkō claimed that he and Ryōgi's father began questioning their role as shinobi, tasked with only fulfilling missions as ordered by those above them, acting as pawns. Thinking back to his mother's words about his father helping people, Ryōgi decided to join the Byakuya Gang. Gekkō finds Ryōgi reminiscing the past, and notices the shōgi piece in his hand.

When Shikadai says he'll end up being someone else's pawn, Ryōgi gets angry.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"After Ryōgi leaves Shikadai, Chōchō, and Inojin arrive, telling him they've been requested due to the protests against the Kaminarimon Company. Gekkō and Ryōgi watch as protesters march against the Kaminarimon Company, Gekkō praising Ryōgi's strategy. One of the leading protesters has a mark on his neck. Ryōgi mulls over what Shikadai might do. At the police station, the genin are shown flyers that have been distributed inciting violence against the Kaminarimon Company. As the protesters are only ordinary citizens instead of shinobi, there's only so much shinobi can do against them without using excessive force. Boruto feels conflicted having to go against citizens. Kōtarō distributes the assignments. Team Moegi is assigned a spot near the company headquarters. At the hospital, Iwabee is frustrated having to stay put, but Lee tells him that orders are absolute. Shikadai studies the distribution of protesters and security forces, recognising it from somewhere. Chōchō recognises the patterns as shōgi pieces, causing Shikadai to recognise the decoy strategy Ryōgi used against him. Shikadai asks Inojin what is the building located in the opening, and Inojin explains it's Katasuke's lab. Realising the Byakuya Gang's plan, Shikadai feels torn between obeying his orders and taking action to foil their plan. Shikadai leaves his post, followed by his team-mates. Team Konohamaru spots Team Moegi moving, and Boruto goes check it out. Mitsuki tells Sarada to trust Boruto. The Byakuya Gang invades the lab, going straight for the ninjutsu data with Katasuke. The protesters arrive at the Kaminarimon Company headquarters, and the police refrains from using ninjutsu against them. On the way to the lab, Shikadai explains to Boruto the lab is the target. Inojin and Chōchō find it uncharacteristic for Shikadai to act without proof, but support him nonetheless. Having analysed their movements, Denki informs Sarada the protesters actions don't match what normal people would do. Using her Sharingan, Sarada spots a leading protester with a mark on his neck. At the research lab, they find downed personnel, and Shikadai and Boruto find Katasuke, who informs them of the stolen work. Katasuke planted a tracker on Gekkō, and gives Boruto a terminal to follow the signal. Despite being suspended, Denki goes to the police and reports the cursed seal placed on many of the protesters, raising the possibility they are under genjutsu. Denki's father is proud of him. Gekkō explains to the gang the nature of what they stole, and assuages Ryōgi when he asks if that will help people. Chōchō, Shikadai, Boruto, and Inojin catch up with them and Shikadai notices Ryōgi. The Byakuya Gang splits up so Gekkō can get away with the stolen data, Shikadai and Boruto go after him while the others hold the rest of the gang back. At the protest, Konoha shinobi begin breaking the genjutsu on the protesters. Chōchō and Inojin make short work of most of the gang, but struggle against Oko. They're saved by Shikamaru. Naruto addresses the village through television and shadow clones, exposing the captured Byakuya Gang as the ones who placed them under genjutsu, and asks the villagers help to keep improving Konoha. Gekkō and Ryōgi hop onto a passing train. Boruto and Shikadai hop on as well, and confront them.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Shikadai asks Ryōgi to snap out of it, and accuses Gekkō of manipulating him, who retorts that reality isn't simple, and accuses Shikadai of being naive in return. Boruto is unimpressed with Gekkō's reason, and strikes him with kunai, which Ryōgi blocks, breaking his mask. Shikadai asks Ryōgi why he protects Gekkō, and Ryōgi tells him of how Gekkō saved him. Shikadai says that's no reason to become a thief, and Ryōgi criticises his belief of how life works, attributing it to living in a prosperous village. Shikadai says he's trying to hard to fit in a too tight mould, and asks if all their shōgi playing was a lie. Ryōgi answers it was an act to get closer to him. Ryōgi's head hurts, and Gekkō orders him to trap Shikadai and Boruto with Ice Release. Shikadai warns Boruto it isn't ordinary Ice Release, Boruto seems to be in a trance. As they move through the train, Ryōgi's head still hurts, and his memories begin changing. Gekkō shows Ryōgi his reflection, restoring the cursed seal. Boruto sees Shikadai as a Byakuya Gang member, and attacks him. Shikadai notices that Boruto was put in genjutsu by the ice mirrors, and cracks them with kunai. Gekkō notices the shōgi pieces Shikadai gave Ryōgi, who insists they mean nothing. Gekkō tosses the pieces out of the train, and orders Ryōgi to prove it by finishing Shikadai. Under the guise of checking his wound, Gekkō activates his jutsu. Shikadai manages to free Boruto from the genjutsu, crediting his own experience with it to being experimented on by Mirai. At the front of the train, Gekkō kills one of his own gang members. Shikadai shares his suspicion that Ryōgi is under genjutsu with Boruto, and warns him not to look at any mirrors. The two break through the ice, and move ahead through the train. They try circumventing Ryōgi by going out of the train to get to Gekkō, but Ryōgi blocks them. Boruto goes ahead to Gekkō while Shikadai pins Ryōgi with his shadow. Boruto stops Gekkō from disconnecting his wagon from the rest of the train. Shikadai tries talking Ryōgi out of serving Gekkō in vain. The cursed seal on Ryōgi activates, and he attacks. The cursed seal spreads through Ryōgi, who sees Shikadai as the one who killed his parents. Gekkō fails to turn Boruto by offering to split the profits of selling the ninjutsu data with him, and moves aside to show Boruto his reflection in the window, forcing him to close his eyes and give Gekkō an opening. Ryōgi closes in on Shikadai and Boruto, while Gekkō separates his wagon and admits to having tampered with Ryōgi's memories. Shikadai tries getting through to Ryōgi, but can't get close to him. Boruto and his shadow clones propel Shikadai forward with Wind Release, allowing him to make physical contact with Ryōgi and break him out of the genjutsu, who recalls that Gekkō was the one who killed his parents. Shikadai sympathises with him. The three are bummed that Gekkō escaped, when someone rushes past them. Naruto catches up to Gekkō and defeats him. Later, Gekkō is interrogated by the police, and Boruto returns Katasuke his research, who is excited that scientific ninja tools are being considered valuable enough to steal. Ryōgi is imprisoned, but remains happy. Boruto and Shikadai discuss the mission, and Boruto asks Shikadai when he'll treat him like he promised.\\n\"},\n",

News of the upcoming Chūnin Exams exasperate him, now concerned he'll be a genin repeater. Shikamaru and Naruto discuss recent developments, and consider the shortage of genin applicants for the exams. Udon comes by Naruto's office, where he lifts Team 5's suspension and gives them a mission. Iwabee discusses the exams with Lee and Denki, all determined not to be left behind. Team 7 receives a delivery mission as Team 5 arrives. Team 5 is to participate in a documentary, a PR attempt to increase the dwindling Academy enrolments. As they begin filming, they all struggle with coming across naturally on camera. The director takes Udon aside and asks if there's another team he could film, and Udon informs him the Hokage personally picked that team. The director tells Udon he used to want to be a shinobi. He wants Team 5 to show him flashy ninjutsu, so Iwabee raises the ground, Lee attacks it, and then throws shuriken at Denki, who substitutes out of their way. The director is pleased with the eye-catching footage, but Udon points out they're scaring the civilians, and withdraws Team 5 from the mission. Later, Iwabee tries throwing his forehead protector in frustration, but is stopped by Lee. Udon asks if they want to be suspended again, and Iwabee questions how someone cool like Udon could possibly understand them. Udon shares how he failed to graduate several times, and how he messed up missions as a genin. Iwabee ponders about Udon's earlier words on looking cool on film. At night, determined not to let their efforts go to waste, the filming crew decides to detonate some explosive tags they had set up on a condemned building to get some shots. Not satisfied with the shots, they do inside, and the building starts to collapse on top of them. Lee saves them from falling debris, and Denki analyses the situation. When the roof collapses, Iwabee protects them from a falling crane, and Udon stops the debris with his snot-based jutsu. In the confusion, Iwabee loses his forehead protector, and the filming crew requests them to be the ones on the documentary again. Upon reporting to Naruto, he shares his past Academy day struggles with the team, and Iwabee is moved to tears when he learns Naruto knows who he is, and gets his forehead protector back, his teammates having found it. Team 7 watches the documentary.\\n\"},\n",

Team 15 is tasked with recapturing the zoo animals. Suika is pleased with their excitement for the mission. Hanabi thinks the girls can perform the mission alone, as she determines there are no dangerous animals on the escaped animals list. Sai checks in with Hanabi about Sumire. They discuss Sumire, and the fact Wasabi and Namida still don't know the whole story about Sumire and Nue. Sumire ponders telling Wasabi and Namida about it. The next day, Sumire provides her team with clothes to mask their scent, making it harder for animals to smell their approach. They capture several animals, but an argument begins after a miscommunication between Wasabi and Namida. A monkey that they're supposed to retrieve steals their lunch, and it also has the keys to the animal enclosures. Wasabi chases it with her Cat Covering, but tires herself before catching up to the monkey. Wasabi wants to try again, and puts Namida's suggestion to come up with a strategy together down, causing her to cry. Hanabi makes her way to the team, having been made aware of another list of missing animals. Namida manages to catch the monkey on her own, but also comes across a giant wolf. Sumire and Wasabi hear Namida scream, but only Sumire goes to help. Sumire protects Namida, and tries having Nue absorb the wolf's chakra, with little effect. Wasabi arrives, and tells Namida she'll lure it so Namida can hit it with her jutsu. Wasabi plants explosive tags on the wolf, which are triggered by Namida's sonic jutsu, knocking the wolf out. Wasabi and Namida make up, and Sumire comes clean about the Nue. They say they already knew and were just waiting for Sumire to tell them herself. Hanabi approaches them and congratulates them on their teamwork. Later, the three eat together and discuss the upcoming Chūnin Exams. Boruto and Mitsuki have heard of their mission.

It attacks them with Lightning Release, Fire Release, and Wind Release. Konohamaru struggles against the White Zetsu, and the genin are unable to help him. Boruto uses the Scientific Ninja Tool Katasuke gave him for his birthday, which stuns the White Zetsu long enough for Konohamaru to land a significant attack, forcing it to retreat. As Mitsuki tends to his injuries, Konohamaru tells them about the White Zetsu. Mitsuki finds a room with a giant flower, that in the past was used to cultivate White Zetsu. Konohamaru comments that the particular form of White Zetsu they fought is something they had never seen before. Mitsuki surmises there's only one White Zetsu, as the flower is dried up, so without chakra, it can't incubate more Zetsu. Konohamaru notices Mitsuki seems to know a lot about the Zetsu, and Mitsuki tells him he was taught by his parent. Boruto proposes they destroy the location, which Konohamaru agrees, but refuses to deploy a certain something when Boruto suggests it. Konohamaru decides to go forward alone, and wants the genin to report back to the village if he doesn't come back. Sarada argues that splitting up will make all of them more vulnerable, so Konohamaru allows them to go with him, and relays a strategy. They find and attack the White Zetsu. Konohamaru has Sarada use her Sharingan to anticipate which attack the Zetsu will use, so each of them can counterbalance its ninjutsu. The White Zetsu switches to physical attacks, so they have Boruto distract it with shadow clones. Boruto tries going in himself when the Zetsu appears weakened, but is captured. Mitsuki manages to free Boruto, and Konohamaru attacks with a Rasengan, finishing it off. They go further down at the roots, where they find numerous decomposed Zetsu cocoons. They arrive at the innermost portion of the ruins, where they find several White Zetsu burning in black flames. Konohamaru explains Sasuke's involvement, and his mission tracking anything related to Kaguya. His claim of Sasuke's strength and rivalry with Naruto spark Boruto's interest. Naruto sends a clone and Konoha shinobi to their location, and discusses with Konohamaru who would make Kaguya go to such lengths in preparing for battle. The genin discuss how they're to keep quiet about this, and how they didn't have enough strength. Meanwhile, Sasuke enters Kaguya's ice dimension to investigate.

Urashiki is also aware of Toneri's intervention with Boruto. Toneri attacks, but Urashiki paralyses him with a chakra string, and utilises a powder to freeze Toneri in time for ten thousand years, as he isn't allowed to kill a clan member.

Lee explains how the battles were arranged. The first battle is Boruto versus Yurui. The briefly clash with swords and kunai before Yurui begins using his exploding bubblegum. Yodo tells Shinki he might not get to fight Boruto. Shinki warns them against fighting Mitsuki, but Toroi is confident he'll beat him. Boruto tries curving his shuriken to weave through the bubblegum, but hits one before getting to Yurui.

The second match is Yodo versus Shikadai. Shikadai goes on the offensive, trying to pin Yodo with his shadow and kunai, but Yodo dodges them easily. She reflects a kunai with an explosive tag back at Shikadai, and dodges his attack again even when he obscures her sight with a smoke bomb. Yodo attacks using her hair to create sound waves. Shikadai steps on leftover of Yurui's gum, and his next attack almost hits her. Shikadai realises she's not using her eyes to read his movements, but is listening to his shifting posture to determine where he's going to attack. Shikadai tries using explosive tags, but her attack hits him again, causing them to detonate. Yodo is paralysed by his shadow, and realises he deliberately set off he tags to muffle the sound of his shifting stance. Cornered, Yodo yields the match. The third match is Sarada versus Tarui. Sarada dodges Tarui's initial attack with her Sharingan, and defeats her with one punch. The fourth match is Inojin versus Araya. Inojin uses explosive tags inside his drawings, but Araya gives no reaction to them, and defeats him. The fifth match is Toroi versus Mitsuki. Toroi uses Lightning Release to increase his reaction time. Mitsuki begins to use Sage Mode, something Shinki apparently recognises. Mitsuki remembers he's not supposed to use Sage Mode, so he summons snakes to pin down Toroi, forcing him to yield. The final match of the first round is Chōchō versus Shinki.\\n\"},\n",

Chōchō attacks with enlarged fists, which Shinki catches with his iron sand. When fighting up close doesn't work, Chōchō attacks from a distance, using her enlarged fists to toss debris. Kurotsuchi is impressed with Shinki, and asks Gaara where he found him. Gaara thinks back to when he found a troubled Shinki and told him he could teach him to use his power. Shinki blocks all of Chōchō's attacks, and throws her to the ground, telling her to give up. Chōchō refuses, and prepares her next attack. Chōji recognises her hand seal, and is surprised that she is resorting to a jutsu she hates using. Chōchō uses the Human Bullet Tank. She manages to pressure Shinki a bit, changing his demeanour for a moment, but still loses. As her friends carry Chōchō out of the arena, Shinki tells Mitsuki he'll defeat him, and continues to talk down on the Konoha genin. Chōchō's parents check on her. Shikadai and Boruto talk before their fight, and Shikadai's parents talk to him. During their fight, Shikadai tries pinning Boruto with his shadow, but he and his clones keep dodging it. When Boruto almost lands a hit on Shikadai, he fans out his shadow, capturing Boruto and all four of his clones. Thinking back on his father, Boruto uses the Kote to create one more shadow clone, forcing Shikadai to dodge, and allowing his other clones to close in on him. Boruto wins to match. Katasuke congratulates Boruto on his win and use of the Kote, and hands him a new scroll to use. Shikadai's teammates console him over his loss. Meanwhile, Boruto is unhappy despite his victory.\\n\"},\n",

Sarada starts the match off using shurikenjutsu, which Araya deflects with his sword, even the ones Sarada bends to attack from a blindspot. Sarada activates her Sharingan to analyse his movements, but can't keep up with Araya's moves. Araya attacks with a spear, and Sarada tries using Sharingan genjutsu against him, but it doesn't work, and Araya manages to injure her. Sarada thinks through the possible reasons for her genjutsu not working, and realises something about Araya. Araya pressures her to end the fight, saying he researched Konoha shinobi. Sarada counters by aiming a Lightning Release at the stands. Metal Lee deflects falling debris, and when the dust clears, it reveals the real Araya, who is a puppeteer using a puppet that looks like himself. Sarada explains how his lack of reaction, machine-like movements, apparent immunity to genjutsu, and knowledge of Sunagakure's puppet users lead her to the realisation. Araya becomes nervous, and Sarada chastises him, pointing out that if had researched well, he'd have realised Sarada's weakness would be drawn out fights, as her Sharigan would drain her chakra. Sarada concludes he wanted to end the fight quickly so she wouldn't have time to figure out his secret. Naruto questions if Araya not being in the arena disqualifies him, but Shikamaru points out the loophole he used; as he never entered the arena, he can't be disqualified for leaving it. Naruto notes they should amend the rules. Sarada ends the fight by incinerating Araya's puppet. The match between Shinki and Mitsuki begins. Mitsuki makes various attacks with Wind Release, which Shinki blocks. Shinki manages to catch and crush Mitsuki with Iron Sand, but it turns out to be a snake clone. Mitsuki, hidden underground, sends snakes all around Shinki, who blocks them again. Mitsuki goes directly for Shinki's feet, pulling him underground. Shinki simply reappears, the one Mitsuki pulled being an Iron Sand clone. Shinki tricks Mitsuki into believing his Lightning Release impaired his control over the Iron Sand, and uses it to augment his taijutsu when Mitsuki tries close combat. Shinki wants to force Mitsuki into using his true strength, and marks him with Iron Sand, so his next attack will seek him out. Mitsuki considers it, but seeing Boruto rooting for him, he decides to forfeit the match. Shinki questions why Mitsuki forfeited, who explains that the inconvenience to his parent and his desire to stay longer outweighed his desire to win. All of his peers are puzzled by Mitsuki's choice, and the final round is scheduled for the next day. That night, Moegi takes her team out for barbecue. Sakura tends to Sarada's injuries. Sasuke shows Boruto the Chidori, and despite it requiring the Sharingan's visual awareness to work, Sasuke instructs Boruto to practice Lightning Release's basics, so he'll be able to use Chidori-like jutsu. Without exposing it's about him, Sasuke tells Boruto how he sought power on his own no matter what, and how a friend saved him in the end. Boruto surprises Sasuke by understanding the importance of friends, saying he has good people around him.\\n\"},\n",

Kurotsuchi, Darui, and Chōjūrō discuss whether that is recklessness or a sign of confidence. Sarada proposes joining forces with Boruto to defeat Shinki, both as payback for Mitsuki and because she doesn't want the Five Kage to see two Konoha shinobi losing in their home. Boruto has his clones attack with explosive tags and Sarada uses Fire Release against Shinki, but he protects himself with his Iron Sand. Naruto comments a similarity to Gaara's jutsu. Shinki uses the same iron fists he used to protect himself to attack, destroying Boruto's clones. Sarada observes Shinki's jutsu with her Sharingan, determining how he controls it. They consider using Lightning Release to disrupt his control, but need a stronger jutsu than what Mitsuki used. They combine their Lightning Release jutsu, and while Shinki approves of their idea, he blocks the attack with a single fist, then grabs Boruto and Sarada. Shinki boasts about his power, angering Boruto. In response, he uses a clone to loosen the grip on Sarada, allowing her to launch an attack while both of Shinki's fists are occupied. He releases them to protect himself. Shinki creates wings with the Iron Sand, surprising Gaara. He targets Sarada, and while she dodges his initial onslaught, his constructs track her because of the mark he placed on her. Sarada charges Shinki, but his attack incapacitates, eliminating her from the match. Shinki angers Boruto by trash talking about his defeated friends. Boruto propels himself towards Shinki with a Lightning Release in hand, but is unable to break through the Iron Sand until he uses Lightning Release: Purple Electricity from the Kote, defeating Shinki. Naruto deduces Boruto's use of a Scientific Ninja Tool, and exposes its use, disqualifying him. Naruto says they'll talk later, but Boruto calls him out on never having time to talk to him.

As Gaara recognises the two based on the similarities to the one who attacked him, Katasuke tells them they're interrupting his announcement, prompting Kinshiki to launch an attack. The attack damages the arena, causing it to start collapsing, leading various shinobi to aid with protecting and evacuating the civilians. Shinki prepares to fight but Gaara tells him not to misjudge his own strength, and directs him to help evacuating people. Kinshiki attacks Sarada, but Sasuke saves her while Momoshiki kicks Naruto out of the arena. Boruto tries attacking Momoshiki with various Kote jutsu, but he absorbs them all. Mitsuki then tries using his Sage Transformation to save Boruto, but Urashiki absorbs it with his fishing hook. Urashiki moves in on Mitsuki, but is blocked by Gaara and Chōjūrō. Shikamaru paralyses Momoshiki and Kinshiki with his shadow, but Momoshiki soon absorbs his jutsu. Sasuke informs Naruto on who they are and what they want, and as the Ōtsutsuki invaders explain how they'll acquire power, Boruto recognises it's the same as his use of the Kote. Naruto and Sasuke don't consider what they have as true power. Urashiki fights Gaara and Chōjūrō, using Gaara's sand against him, and breaks Chōjūrō's sword. Chōjūrō creates a water spike from his hand, and he and Gaara chastise Urashiki on relying on the power of borrowed weapons instead of the skill acquired through dedicated training. Momoshiki and Kinshiki scoff at Naruto and Sasuke's assertion what they use isn't true power. Momoshiki eats a chakra pill, and produces an attack by amplifying the many jutsu he has absorbed. Momoshiki sends a fire pheasant at them, but Naruto blocks it by manifesting Kurama's head and creates shadow clones to protect civilians still in the arena. Momoshiki sends several elemental attacks through the arena. Sasuke armours Kurama's head with his Susanoo. Meanwhile, Urashiki blocks Chōjūrō's water spike with his fishing rod, and produces a Lightning Release he absorbed from Mitsuki from his gourd. Urashiki sees through Gaara's sand, and uses sand of his own to counter it. Urashiki produces many fishing hooks to attack Gaara, but is blocked by a massive water vortex Chōjūrō created with underground water, which Gaara dug up for him with his sand. Urashiki activates his tomoe Rinnegan and escapes, but not before taunting them with his clansmens' work on the arena. Naruto resists Momoshiki's attack, impressing him, so he consumes more chakra pills, creating a massive attack. Naruto asks Sasuke to protect the children, and fully manifests Kurama's form. He considers using a Tailed Beast Ball to counter the attack, but chooses against it. Sasuke explains to Boruto that Naruto could have easily countered the attack, but doing so would damage a lot of the surrounding area. From all over Konoha, people watch Naruto take the full force of Momoshiki's attack. As it detonates, Boruto experiences Naruto's memories through his chakra, and cries out as the blast reaches him.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto sees how many others got injured despite Naruto's efforts, and runs out of the hospital. Boruto notices he's still wearing his Shinobi Gauntlet after tripping on a medical kit, and angrily throws it away. Upon waking up, Hinata asks about Naruto, and Sasuke assures her he's fine, and to leave the rest to him. Boruto goes to Naruto's office, thinking about all the times he complained about Naruto. He finds and wears Naruto's old clothes. Sasuke tells Boruto he's in a similar situation Naruto used to be, scorned by others. He reveals he can still sense Naruto's chakra, and that he intends to rescue him with Boruto's help. The other Kage arrive, saying they'll help, so everyone pools all of their knowledge of each of the Ōtsutsuki's abilities. The Kage question Sasuke's decision to bring Boruto along, but he assures them he has a reason. Sasuke hands Boruto his own forehead protector with Naruto's scratch on it and explains the history behind it. As Sasuke, Boruto, and the Kage prepare to leave, Sarada asks Sasuke to go with them. He instructs her to help Kakashi and Shikamaru protect the village, as she's the only other person with the Sharingan. Boruto tries apologising to Shikadai, but he says they have more pressing matters, and that he'll listen to what he has to say later. Sasuke opens a portal with his Rinnegan. Hinata arrives, and is shocked to see Boruto in Naruto's old clothes. The sight reminds her of her husband when he was younger, and that moves Hinata to entrust Naruto's safety to her son.

Sarada informs Mitsuki of how things turned out after he was attacked. In a wasteland where a God Tree resides, Momoshiki drains Kurama's chakra from Naruto. Kinshiki explains that this God Tree was created from a man who also harboured a Tailed Beast, who Naruto understands to be Killer B. Momoshiki complains about how long the process is taking, having only absorbed half of the chakra in Naruto. Naruto says he won't make it easy for them, that as shinobi, they've had to persevere to develop their abilities. Momoshiki explains how they're able to effortlessly acquire power, which Naruto links to the Shinobi Gauntlet, blaming himself for ignoring Boruto to the point it drove him to rely on the Scientific Ninja Tool. Momoshiki resumes extracting his chakra. The other four Kage arrive, interrupting Momoshiki, and cutting Naruto free from his restraints. The Kage fight Momoshiki and Kinshiki while Sasuke and Boruto check on Naruto. Naruto notices Boruto is wearing his old clothes. Naruto apologises for ignoring Boruto, sharing a bit of his own mischievous past. Boruto asks Naruto to tell him his story after they go back home. In Konoha, Shikamaru instructs other shinobi to make sure no one else is missing, and to be on the lookout for Urashiki. Shikadai asks him if they shouldn't send reinforcements. Shikamaru sees his concern for Boruto is like his for Naruto. He explains their current situation using shogi analogies. Sasuke fights Kinshiki, who has to dodge an attack from Chōjūrō instead of landing a hit on Sasuke. Chōjūrō allows himself to be hit, so a concealed Kurotsuchi can land a hit on him, sending him flying for Sasuke's strike. Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi pin Kinshiki down. The others focus on Momoshiki, Gaara using his sand to offer others footing while pursuing him. Boruto warns Naruto of Momoshiki's ability to absorb and amplify any ninjutsu used against him. Momoshiki notices Kinshiki has been incapacitated, and upon checking Boruto with his Byakugan, notices how Naruto is unable to pass on his power to him, and offers to show how his clan does it. He converts Kinshiki into a chakra edible and consumes it, Sasuke attempts to strike him but fails. Momoshiki's appearance changes, including manifesting a third Rinnegan on his forehead, and tells Naruto he's next.\\n\"},\n",

Momoshiki releases a pulse of energy that cuts clean through the God Tree, and pushes everyone back. Momoshiki flies towards Darui and Gaara, kicking Darui away before he can react. Gaara manages to catch Momoshiki with his sand, but Momoshiki uses his hair to bind and strangle him, loosing Gaara's grip on him, allowing Momoshiki to toss him aside. Momoshiki proceeds to knock out Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi. Momoshiki targets Naruto, and the two engage with taijutsu, and the latter gains the upper hand when he strikes Naruto's tenketsu. Sasuke attacks Momoshiki, who evades his attack, counterattacks, and rams both Naruto and Sasuke on the ground, throwing them against the remains of the God Tree. Naruto and Sasuke go on the offensive, activating their chakra mode and dōjutsu respectively, and Momoshiki manifests a weapon to counter them. Sasuke unseals a fūma shuriken, which he electrifies, and guides at Momoshiki with wires. Naruto multiplies them. Momoshiki dodges some, but as he begins to get hit, he unleashes an energy pulse to repel them. Momoshiki narrowly avoids a fūma shuriken that comes from underground, breaking through the God Tree stump they're fighting on. The fūma shuriken is a transformed Naruto, who throws a Rasenshuriken at Momoshiki. Just before it hits, the Rasenshuriken transforms back into Sasuke. Momoshiki binds Sasuke with manifested chains, but Sasuke switches places with Momoshiki, leaving him bound and open to a strike by Naruto. Sasuke uses the opportunity to trap Momoshiki with Chibaku Tensei. Momoshiki breaks free by manifesting a wooden dragon, which Naruto and Sasuke break. Momoshiki lands on the God Tree stump, using it to manifest more wooden dragons. One of them catches Sasuke, and Momoshiki channels an explosion through it. Naruto manifests Kurama and protects Sasuke. Momoshiki coalesces the rocks around into a monkey in retaliation. Sasuke armours Naruto with Susanoo, and they cut through Momoshiki's monkey. Boruto watches the fight in awe. Naruto and Sasuke power down, and the other Kage ask if they're done. Kurotsuchi wants to use a flashy jutsu to end him, but Chōjūrō and Gaara point out he'd absorb them and regain strength. Katasuke arrives with Kōsuke, and against the others' warnings, fires several ninjutsu at Momoshiki with the Shinobi Gauntlet. Momoshiki absorbs them, regaining strength, and uses the absorbed jutsu against them. Gaara protects the group with his sand, but before they can strike back, Momoshiki paralyses them with an absorbed Nara shadow ninjutsu, and for extra measure, pins Naruto down with black receivers. Boruto remembers Sasuke's words from before, and on Sasuke's command, throws his Rasengan. Naruto wonders when Boruto learned it, while Momoshiki thinks he should have stayed out of sight. He prepares to absorb it, but it vanishes before reaching him, so he turns his attention back to the shinobi. Boruto's attack connects, breaking Momoshiki's hold on the others. Sasuke explains to Naruto how he trained Boruto on the condition he learned the Rasengan. Momoshiki consumes more chakra pills to power up for decisive attack. Naruto tells Boruto to make another Rasengan, and adds his chakra to enlarge it. Sasuke distracts Momoshiki, throwing his sword and switching places with it to get close. Sasuke's sword is a transformed Boruto, who throws a kunai. Momoshiki catches it, and Sasuke switches it with his Chidori, so Momoshiki strikes his own arm, while Sasuke uses the kunai to stab the Rinnegan on his hand, preventing him from using it to absorb jutsu. Boruto uses clones to distract Momoshiki, allowing his real self to attack with the Naruto-powered Rasengan. Momoshiki counters with a similar attack, but Boruto prevails. As his body is destroyed, Momoshiki's spirit talks to Boruto, recognising that he strongly inherited Ōtsutsuki powers. He gives Boruto a cryptic information about his future and a warning him that his victory means he can't stay an ordinary human, grabbing his arm before disappearing. Katasuke is confused about recent events, unsure of what happened. Momoshiki's chakra receivers vanish.

Boruto apologises for his actions to Team Shinki. Sarada teases Boruto about it.

Sasuke says he'll leave to track Urashiki. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss how they still got to see the skills of the participants, requiring meeting with the other villages to discuss the outcome. Shikamaru also points out Naruto has to deal with Katasuke, and informs him that Killer B returned to Kumogakure. Naruto wants to take time off, but Shikamaru advises to finish handling his paperwork first. At the mission assignment desk, Team 7 talks to Team 5, who are glad to see Mitsuki has recovered. Team 10 comes by, having finished a mission. Boruto and Shikadai ride the train, the situation between them awkward. They both apologise to each other; Boruto for having cheated, Shikadai for making Boruto wait so long to talk to him when he said he would after the attack on the exam. They talk about the type of shinobi they want to be. On the train back to Sunagakure, Shinki thinks how Boruto, who he perceives as weak, went against a much stronger opponent and won. Gaara claims responsibility for telling him not to fight, but Shinki says that even if he had fought, he'd have lost. Gaara tells him to focus on his own path instead of the paths of others beside him.

Boruto is interviewed for his participation in the fight against the Ōtsutsuki. Sarada asks if Boruto intends to become Hokage, but he denies it, saying that is her dream, while he wants to become like Sasuke.

Ashina was frustrated with Tomaru monopolising the production only because of his good looks when she thinks he can't act. Ashina plans to kill herself with explosive tags, but Konohamaru knocks them off her hand, causing them to go off and cause rock slides. Tomaru falls and hurts his back. Moegi and the genin protect the crew. Thinking about Mitsuki's potato chip lecture, Chōchō exposes her chubby self to Tomaru as she protects him from falling rocks. Ashina is arrested, and Tomaru becomes attracted to Chōchō. She offers him chips, but refuses his ring, saying she wants to remain free, and that he'll have plenty of rivals to fight over her. Chōchō gives Mitsuki a bag of chips, who later eats them with Orochimaru. Mitsuki tells him to disregard his earlier question about being his father or mother. Chōchō eats with her parents.\\n\"},\n",

Metal Lee is uncharacteristically confident, which he attributes to an anti-anxiety necklace he's wearing. Not long after recieving the plate, Team 5 breaks it, resulting in a failed mission. Team 7 says the necklace doesn't work at all, and asks Lee where he got it. They're incredulous when Lee says he bought it online for upcoming training, during which he can't get nervous.Later, Rock Lee demonstrates the power of the first of the Eight Gates to his son, and explains the concept and consequences of using it. When he asks Metal about the necklace, and Metal answers him, he postpones the training. Elsewhere, Metal wonders about his father's words, and is approached by Might Guy. Metal explains his situation, and Guy invites him to tag along with him for the day. Metal takes Guy to his speaking session at the Academy. On the way, Metal carries Guy in his wheelchair up several sets of stairs, and gets nervous when others see him. He wonders if he should get another necklace. At the Academy, Iwabee is excited to hear Guy speak. Denki is interested because of his own lack of skill with taijutsu. Guy speaks to the students about using taijutsu during the war, but forgets the names of those he fought. He speaks about having no regrets and facing the truth instead of worrying about it. He offers to demonstrate his taijutsu and picks Iwabee and Metal to participate in a sparring match, where he quickly defeats them both. Later, Metal is depressed because he can't even deal with his anxiety when Guy was able to fight on one leg. Guy tells him to think about what he learned that day. Metal practices at night, still relying on the necklace. Rock Lee watches from afar, and talks about it with Guy. The next day, Team 5 has another mission, where they fail to capture a thief because Lee, now with three necklaces, made too much noise. Rock Lee challenges his son to a match, and invites people to watch, saying that if he can't face that, he has no chance of learning the Eight Gates. Guy questions Metal about his anxiety, finding that to be his true self. The next day, Metal shows up to the challenge, and removes the necklaces, having learned from Guy to accept the fact he's anxious. Metal fights, and despite receiving several hits, and being nervous from having an audience, he continues fighting. As his nervousness increases, Metal's movements become more erratic, making them harder for Rock Lee to read. Metal opens the first gate unconsciously, surprising his father, and lands a hit on him, meeting the victory condition Rock set. Guy declares Metal the winner, and they explain to Metal that he managed to open the first gate. Team 5 meets with Team 7 when they go receive another mission. They ask about the necklace, and Lee owns up to his anxiety. They're tasked with transporting a valuable vase. However, when Suika warns Metal not to break it, he begins to feel nervous, and his friends try to stop him from breaking the vase.\\n\"},\n",

At the Lightning Burger, Mitsuki tells his friends about having his first dream while wondering what to eat. Boruto is surprised he's never had a dream, and Chōchō complains about him taking too much time to place an order. When Boruto asks him, he confesses he never felt like rebelling against his parent. They're joined by Shikadai and Inojin, who has a chick on his shoulder. They explain it's from an egg that hatched the day before when they were fulfilling a mission in a poultry farm, and got attached to him. When Sarada and Boruto explain it imprinted on him, Mitsuki mentally compares it to first seeing Boruto after deciding not to choose neither Log nor Orochimaru. Sarada reminds her team they have security duty for the Five Kage Summit. At the summit, due to the topic being the Ōtsutsuki clan, they also invited the previous Kage, Kakashi, Mei and A. Darui notices Ōnoki's absence, and Kurotsuchi says he came with her, but gave her the slip. They surmise he's sightseeing. While keeping watch, Boruto is bored, and asks Mitsuki to tell him something interesting. Mitsuki instead asks him if he ever felt like his thoughts weren't his own. He wonders if his attachment to his friends is like the chick that imprinted on Inojin, like a genjutsu they can't break. Boruto dismisses the concern, saying they're not chickens, and Mitsuki asks if he has any fun stories. Boruto tells them about a question his father gave him to solve the day before, about the hardest rock in the world. They notice some shinobi by their location, and Mitsuki goes to ask what is happening. Sarada tells Boruto he should be more mindful of Mitsuki's troubles, or he'll stop liking him. Boruto answers they're good friends, and that it'll never happen. Mitsuki informs them the shinobi are looking for Ōnoki, exciting Boruto, who is sure that as Tsuchikage, he's bound know how to answer the question. As they examine his drawing, Ōnoki passes by, taking it and commenting it doesn't look like him. Ōnoki knows who Boruto and Sarada are, but not Mitsuki. They tell him he needs to go back to the summit, but he doesn't want to attend a boring meeting. He mock threatens them with Dust Release, but throws his back. Boruto asks him about the hardest rock, and Ōnoki says he'll tell him if instead of taking him back to the summit, he shows him around the village. Boruto and Mitsuki agree to it. Sarada questions it, but Ōnoki tells her the summit would be boring. At the summit, they discuss the missing Urashiki, and Naruto says Sasuke has left to investigate. Kurotsuchi is exasperated by everyone's easygoing attitude. In the village, when a construct beam is about to fall a civilian, Ōnoki protects the civilian with his Dust Release, impressing the genin, but passes out from the effort. When he wakes up, he mistakes Boruto for someone called Kozuchi. When asked about it, he explains Kozuchi was his grandchild, who died at a young age. As promised, Ōnoki explains about the hardest rock, saying it's the unbreakable will of shinobi. When Boruto and Sarada begin bickering, Ōnoki asks Mitsuki about his will, who finds it complicated, and unsure. Ōnoki says if he keeps going at it, it must be truth. Boruto asks Ōnoki not to tell Naruto he told him the answer, but Ōnoki reveals he asked Naruto the question, who just asked Boruto without actually knowing the answer. Ōnoki tells them to visit him if they ever go to the Land of Earth, and wants more dumplings before going back to the summit. After dropping Ōnoki, Boruto thinks it was a trick question, but Mitsuki found the answer satisfying. Arriving home, Mitsuki becomes alert when he notices someone has been there, and sees a letter for him, which he burns. The next day, two shinobi on guard duty at the village's gate are attacked with Lightning Release.\\n\"},\n",

In the morning, Sai checks in on the police investigation and finds a Konoha forehead protector by the site. Sarada notes Mitsuki is late, and doubts Boruto when he says he's probably still at home. They decide to go tell Mitsuki their missions have been cancelled in person. When they arrive, they find his door open, so they enter his empty apartment. Boruto finds it depressing, and the two consider how Mitsuki never spoke of parents and his home village. They see a portrait of Boruto by his bed. Boruto asks the other genin if they've seen Mitsuki. Inojin thinks Boruto would know where to find him. Chōchō says all the jōnin have been summoned by the Hokage, even when most missions were cancelled that day. Boruto and Sarada inform Konohamaru that Mitsuki is missing, and notice he's hiding something when he brushes them off. Boruto and Sarada eavesdrop on a high-level meeting, where they speculate who might be behind the attack on the guards and why. Tsunade arrives, having heard of the attack. Sai has Konohamaru confirm the forehead protector he found is Mitsuki's. They consider Mitsuki might have been the target, while Tsunade is unaware of who Mitsuki is. Because of the situation, they also call in Homura and Koharu. Ino checks the guards' memories of the attack, and sees Mitsuki leaving with the assailants on his own. Boruto and Sarada don't know what to make of it. Konohamaru considers Mitsuki might have an ulterior motive, and suggests contacting Mitsuki's guardian. Naruto reveals to those who don't know that Mitsuki is Orochimaru's son. Tsunade is angry and the advisers consider Mitsuki to be as dangerous as Orochimaru. Naruto says he's accepted Mitsuki as a shinobi, and Shikamaru adds that Orochimaru's research will be important when fighting the Ōtsutsuki. Boruto and Sarada discuss Mitsuki's loyalty, and how there is much they don't know about him. Sarada says that as shinobi, they must consider every possibility. Boruto wonders if the Hokage Sarada wants to be just has amazing skills. He then admonishes her for not giving Mitsuki the benefit of the doubt before leaving. Shikadai informs Boruto the village is under increased security alert, that a tracking team is being assembled to look for Mitsuki, and warns Boruto not to do anything stupid. Near the attack site, Boruto finds one of Mitsuki's snakes being attacked by the remnant of one of the attackers. Boruto defeats the remnant, and the snake relays a recorded message to Boruto that this is Mitsuki's will. At night, Boruto prepares to leave for find Mitsuki and confirm his message. Despite the danger, Sarada joins him, and wants to take the snake to Orochimaru to get more information about it.\\n\"},\n",

Yamato informs Orochimaru of Mitsuki's escape, and tells Orochimaru to inform him if Mitsuki makes contact. At Konoha, the leadership discusses the merits of Naruto's decision to allow Mitsuki into the village and to proceed. Udon informs them that Boruto and Sarada have gone missing. As Shikadai is likely to know how Boruto will act, Shikamaru considers having his team go after them. Konohamaru asks to go, as the missing genin are his responsibility. He is conflicted about Mitsuki, and asks Naruto why he placed him on his team. Naruto wanted Konohamaru to get to know Mitsuki without the possible bias of knowing he's Orochimaru's son getting in the way, but regrets that Konohamaru had to find out like this. Shikamaru doesn't allow him to go. Inojin and Chōchō wonder how Boruto and Sarada came to go after Mitsuki. Shikadai is more concerned with the village turning on them. Moegi arrives and they depart to retrieve Boruto and Sarada. Sarada disguises herself as Mitsuki and draws the jōnin away from Orochimaru's lair, allowing Boruto to slip in unnoticed. While looking for Orochimaru, Boruto finds a tank with a Mitsuki clone growing in it. Suigetsu finds him, and Orochimaru introduces himself to Boruto. Orochimaru explains to Boruto that all the Mitsuki are his experiments. He isn't worried about Mitsuki's disappearance, as if anyone discovers Mitsuki's nature as his experiment, a cursed seal in him will activate, self-destructing Mitsuki so the secrets of his research will remain safe. Boruto is disconcerted about what Orochimaru is actually worried about. The jōnin trap Sarada in a barrier, but Karin rescues her, tells her Boruto is waiting for her, and transforms into Mitsuki to draw the jōnin away from her. Boruto hands Orochimaru the snake Mitsuki left behind and relays the message it gave him. Orochimaru agrees to further examine the snake. Sarada meets up with Boruto, who asks her if she knew about Mitsuki, having been to that lab before, and shows her the Mitsuki clones. Orochimaru discusses Mitsuki with Log. Karin reveals her ruse to Yamato and escapes. Orochimaru informs the genin the snake had no other messages, distressing Boruto, who fixates on Mitsuki. Orochimaru explains it was Mitsuki's decision to go to Konoha, and asks him what he'll do if it's also his decision to leave it. Boruto and Sarada discuss how they've treated Mitsuki. Boruto confirms to Orochimaru he still trusts Mitsuki, so Orochimaru instructs them to take the snake to the White Snake Sage at Ryūchi Cave so they can learn from the snake's own thoughts. Yamato returns to Orochimaru's lab, asking him why he sent Karin. Orochimaru denies it, and also denies that Boruto and Sarada were there when Yamato asks it.

They explain they've been sent to bring Boruto and Sarada back to the village, or else they'll be considered missing-nin. They try arguing with the two, but are unable to convince them to return, so they attack. Despite not fighting to kill, Team 10 manages to pressure the two. Inojin tries sealing Boruto, while Chōchō holds Sarada in place. Boruto destroys Inojin's sealing scroll with a Vanishing Rasengan, and Sarada frees herself with a flash bomb. Though they escape, Shikadai is confident he has discerned the pattern of their actions. In Konoha, Temari takes lunch to Shikamaru at work, and questions why Team 10 was assigned to retrieve Boruto and Sarada. Shikamaru says Shikadai has learned from the Byakuya Gang incident, so he'll act even if they're his friends. While Inojin does aerial reconnaissance, Moegi, Shikadai, and Chōchō discuss Mitsuki, and how Boruto and Sarada going after him reflects on everyone else. Shikadai ponders why Sarada, who's so level-headed, would also go off after Mitsuki. Inojin reports there are two sets of Boruto and Sarada. They split up to go after both sets. Moegi defeats the decoys, and the genin catch up to them, having flown with Inojin's drawn beasts. Shikadai is able to predict their strategy, and through a ruse with Inojin, is able to pin down Boruto and Sarada. Shikadai notices Mitsuki's snake with them. Shikamaru elaborates to Temari that he thinks there's more to Mitsuki's disappearance, and that Boruto and Sarada may have found a clue, so he's counting on Shikadai to discover what it is, and make a decision based on it. Learning of the contents of Mitsuki's message and the circumstances of its discovery, Shikadai decides to join Boruto and Sarada, to everyone's surprise. On her way to the genin, Moegi is attacked by an unknown assailant, and fights back. Shikadai explains how all the inconsistencies of Mitsuki's departure add up. Despite still not being convinced Mitsuki is innocent, he agrees that the best way to learn the truth is from Mitsuki himself. Chōchō decides to join in so Moegi doesn't yell at her for failing to stop them, and Inojin does it so he won't be the only one left behind. The assailant counters Moegi's Water Release with the very same jutsu, and falls back, leading her to realise he was just stalling for time. Moegi gets exasperated when she finds an apology from her genin. Boruto and Sarada explain to the others where they're going and why. Moegi's assailant, Suigetsu, watches as the genin go forward, wondering about Orochimaru's intent. By nightfall, they start approaching Ryūchi Cave.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto reiterates the need to have the White Snake Sage analyse the snake Mitsuki left them. Sarada explains some of what Orochimaru told them about the Ryūchi Cave. She notices footprints on the ground, and discerning they're theirs, realises they've been going in circles. Boruto says they have to keep going. They're watched by three ornately dressed women, who upon noting they're not simply lost, decide to check them out. The genin arrive at a richly decorated gate to Ryūchi Cave, finding it not to be what they expected, and are greeted by a hostess. The hostess introduces herself as Tagorihime, who welcomes them to relax. Boruto asks about the White Snake Sage, and Tagorihime says he's in a temple, and can arrange for Boruto to meet him. Inojin and Chōchō begin to eat, despite Boruto's warnings about what kind of place Ryūchi Cave is supposed to be. Though not as eager, Sarada and Shikadai accept Tagorihime's hospitality, while Boruto remains suspicious. When Tagorihime mentions Mitsuki, Boruto notices they didn't mention the name to her, and alerts the others. Tagorihime's face distorts into that of a snake as she says they should have just eaten the food. The facade of their location dissolves. Tagorihime laments missing out on eating the chakra of children, and a voice in the fog speaks to her, reminding her they didn't fail the test to weed out those searching for Ryūchi Cave. Tagorihime retreats into the fog, telling them not to assume they'll survive until the end. They venture deeper into the fog, towards the next source of light. They get separated in the fog, and Boruto follows another figure into the cave. A door closes behind him, and he notices the door has grooves where stone bits in the room fit. Ichikishimahime congratulates him, always disappearing when Boruto looks at her and reappearing elsewhere. She explains he'll only be able to leave if he fills out all the spaces on the boulder. Revealing her snake face, Ichikishimahime explains she doesn't like fresh chakra, and prefers faint, weak chakra she can drink. Boruto takes his time filling the wall, but there's one groove none of the stones fit into. Boruto doesn't want to waste time there when he can search for Mitsuki. Ichikishimahime asks if Boruto is there to acquire the Sage's power, and he says he's only there to find Mitsuki. Boruto breaks a stone by accident, and thinks to break other stones to make them fit the last groove. Boruto passes the trial, and is bitten by another snakewoman, Tagitsuhime, who says she'll test his heart. Boruto begins to see visions of his friends berating him for being inconsiderate of others and endangering them. Boruto is resolute in finding Mitsuki, and passes the trial. Tagitsuhime says he has earned the right to meet the White Snake Sage, and that his friends are up ahead. He finds them unconscious, but unharmed, and wakes them up. They meet up with the White Snake Sage, and explain Orochimaru pointed them in his direction. The Sage comments on how Orochimaru has changed. The Sage follows up explaining the trials he went through were for learning senjutsu, but Boruto reiterates his goal, something the Sage is uninterested in helping with. However, the Sage agrees to help on the condition of dealing with Garaga, a giant snake that has been troubling the Sage, by bringing to her Garaga's reverse scale. The group leaves to find Garaga, and Tagitsuhime asks the Sage if it's wise to make that promise, but the Sage doubts they'll survive facing Garaga at all.\\n\"},\n",

The genin recall the Sage's explanation of Garaga going into frenzies over having lost an eye in battle. They get startled when coming across some snake statues, and find Garaga, who attacks them. Shikadai tries paralysing him, but Garaga is too big for him and breaks through his jutsu. Boruto spots Garaga's reverse scale, but Garaga moves before he can attack. Sarada is thrown aside by Garaga's movement, and is almost eaten, but another snake intervenes, biting Garaga, giving the genin a chance to escape. At Konoha, Moegi arrives alone for her report, and gives Shikamaru the shōgi piece Shikadai left behind, which confirms his suspicions something is amiss with Mitsuki's departure. Uō's condition is stabilising, so Sakura has Yurito deliver Naruto a report. Tsunade discusses the situation with Naruto and Shikamaru, when Yurito delivers the report. Sarada thinks the blue snake was trying to protect her. The blue snake finds them, and introduces himself as Aoda, a summoning snake who has pledged loyalty to Sasuke. Garaga has a fit over Aoda's interference. The genin explain their situation to Aoda. Shikadai notices Aoda doesn't have a reverse scale, and asks if Garaga's the only one who does. Aoda explains most violent snakes have them, and that they become milder once their reverse scale is removed. Aoda wants to escort them back to Konoha, but Sarada insists on their task. Shikamaru speculates on who would have knowledge to target Mitsuki. Teams 5 and 15 worry about Boruto and the others. Yurito steals something from the room where Uō is recovering. Hinata and Sakura meet on the office's entrance, where Hinata apologises for Boruto taking Sarada with him, but Sakura says Sarada is responsible for her own decisions. Shikadai has devised a plan involving Boruto, Chōchō, and Aoda. An enlarged Chōchō challenges Garaga, creating a distraction for Inojin to cover his remaining eye with ink. Shikadai pins Garaga with his shadow, aided by Aoda and Chōchō to hold him in place.

Aoda is exhausted and injured, and cautions them not to touch Garaga's Reverse Scale, which turns those who touch it into stone. In Konohagakure, Sakura leaves the room where Uō is recovering, and Yurito tries injecting him with something. Before he can do it, Uō is revealed to be a transformed Moegi.

Kirara leaves to make her report. Kokuyō wants everyone to stay on schedule with the plan. Sekiei continues with Mitsuki. The genin have trouble seeing Garaga's attacks, because he camouflages himself in his feeding ground, which is also dark. Inojin tries scouting in one if his drawings, but is attacked and retreats. He saves Boruto from another attack, who thanks him for his quick drawing. Inojin points out he didn't draw that fast, but used the drawing he was riding when he was attacked, which Garaga didn't destroy. This gives Shikadai an idea of how to counter Garaga. Shikadai deduces Garaga is tracking them through heat, which Inojin's drawings don't emit. Using shadow clones to throw Garaga off, Boruto is able to land a Vanishing Rasengan on Garaga's Reverse Scale, giving the others an opportunity to use explosive tags to collapse the ceiling on top of him. Garaga emerges from the rubble, so Shikadai tries holding him with his shadow, while Boruto propels himself to get the scale. Garaga opens his blind eye. Boruto enters Garaga's mind, and learns how Garaga lost his eye, when he acted as a summoning snake for a shinobi. His summoner wanted to retreat during a battle, but he wanted to keep fighting, so his summoner used Lightning Release against him, costing him his eye. Boruto explains why they need his scale, and the two argue about betrayal, Garaga wanting to see how Mitsuki's betrayal will lead to Boruto's death. Boruto decides not to take Garaga's scale by force, but decides to enter a summoning contract with him, so he'll be able to see if Boruto fails to bring Mitsuki back. Garaga agrees, adding that he'll eat Boruto if he fails. They return to the White Snake Sage, Chōchō restored, and when she asks about the scale, Boruto summons Garaga. The White Snake Sage reveals her true form, and shows them Mitsuki's snake's thoughts. Mitsuki had the snake stop the hearts of the guards to convince the assailants they were dead. They told him he could find answers to his questions if he went with them to the Land of Earth. Boruto is glad Mitsuki saved the guard, but Shikadai points out he still went with the enemy.

Boruto uses shadow clones to distract Kokuyō from Shikadai's jutsu, but he dodges it regardless. He uses his tonfa as a ranged weapon to finish off Boruto's remaining clone. Sarada blocks the Akuta's attack on her, and Kokuyō claims his powers don't come from jutsu, which he can't use, but from pure strength. Boruto manages to dodge Kokuyō's attack, and uses Wind Release to throw him in the air, Sarada throwing the Akuta at him. Kokuyō knocks the Akuta aside, which Shikadai pins down upon landing, allowing Boruto to destroy it with a Rasengan. Kokuyō attacks Sarada faster than she can react with her Sharingan, and uses his tonfa to cause a rockslide. Before Kokuyō can attack Sarada again, Chōchō arrives and lands a hit on him, then tosses a large rock on top on him. Joined by Inojin, they explain they turned back when they found defeated Konoha shinobi. Shikadai tells Boruto and Sarada to go on ahead, while he, Chōchō, and Inojin deal with Kokuyō. Sekiei notices Kokuyō is taking time to catch up, and simply states he's strong when Mitsuki asks if he trusts Kokuyō. A couple Akuta manifest from the ground and update Sekiei on the situation. Sekiei doesn't allow Mitsuki to stay with him, and has the Akuta guard him, while he goes to deal with Boruto and Sarada. The two narrowly avoid an explosive butterfly from Sekiei, who asks them how they got past Kokuyō. Sarada notices he kneads chakra into the clay to make it explode, and Sekiei explains that Explosive Clay was the jutsu implanted on him. Boruto summons Garaga, much to Sekiei's excitement. Garaga doesn't attack, instead throwing Boruto off of him, refusing to help him. Kokuyō exhausts Chōchō, so Shikadai gives Inojin an opening to try sealing him. The genin retreat while Kokuyō breaks through the seal, and when considering they're weak, but wise, wonders if that is a human strength. Garaga laughs at Boruto as he struggles against Sekiei. When Boruto tells Sekiei he and Mitsuki are friends, he asks Boruto if that's something Boruto decided arbitrarily, Boruto confirms this, but decides that it is one more reason to reach Mitsuki, to really get to know him. Garaga tells Boruto that if he agrees to become his underling, he might help, but Boruto arrogantly blows him off. Sekiei attacks Boruto, but Garaga protects him. Angered that Boruto told him to leave, Garaga rampages and attacks Sekiei, who suddenly feels ill. Boruto uses the opportunity to strike, but his attack is blocked by Mitsuki. Mitsuki checks on Sekiei, and reiterates to Boruto and Sarada his decision to go with the Iwagakure shinobi. Boruto offers Mitsuki his forehead protector back, but Mitsuki attacks him. Garaga scoffs at Boruto. Kokuyō, having seen everything, declares Mitsuki to be trustworthy. Deciding that Boruto isn't worth killing in his current state, he and Mitsuki leave with Sekiei. Boruto calls out to Mitsuki, but passes out.\\n\"},\n",

Mitsuki asks about the Akuta with them and if meeting their creator would answer his question about one's will, and Kokuyō explains their provenance. Uō and Saō find them out, and Mitsuki attacks them so the others wouldn't kill them, faking their deaths, and leaving a snake behind with a message for Boruto. In the present, Mitsuki coaches Sekiei in human mannerisms while on their way to the Land of Earth. Sekiei's body begins to break down, so Kokuyō leaves to get help, leaving Mitsuki to look after Sekiei. Kurotsuchi visits her grandfather, who is under Akatsuchi's care. Kontsuchi asks her how Ōnoki is, but Kurotsuchi says he's in no condition to answer the questions she wants to ask. While discussing who should investigate the matter Naruto warned her about, Kurotsuchi's group is attacked by Kū and Kakō, who demand she step down from her position as Tsuchikage. As she attacks him, Kurotsuchi seemingly recognises Kū and is shocked. As Sekiei's health deteriorates, Mitsuki gives him flowers to cheer him up. Mitsuki explains eating and brushing one's teeth to Sekiei, and the two end up talking about their creators, Orochimaru and Kū. They also discuss death, wondering what it would take for Mitsuki to cry. Sekiei ambushes Mitsuki, putting an explosive centipede around his neck, and questions him about faking the death of the Konoha shinobi and the snake he left behind. Mitsuki explains it was a message telling Boruto he left by his own volition, and not to look for him. Sekiei asks more about Boruto, who still believed Mitsuki was his friend, and how Mitsuki feels about him. Mitsuki explains how Boruto is his sun, how close friends share secrets, and that he's unsure whether this feeling is genuine or was created by someone else. Mitsuki helps Sekiei, and Kokuyō returns with Kakō and Kirara, who injects Sekiei with something that stabilises him. They find it suspicious Sekiei's health failed around Mitsuki, and want to knock him unconscious before continuing. Mitsuki says he agreed to go with them, but not with being captured. Sekiei wakes up and vouches for Mitsuki, comparing his loneliness to theirs, and secretly telling Mitsuki they share a secret now, making them close friends. In Iwagakure, Kurotsuchi is held captive while Kū creates more Akuta. The Konoha genin look over an unconscious Boruto.\\n\"},\n",

Sarada thinks they should return to Konoha, despite the punishment for leaving, so they can report what they know. However, Shikadai wants to continue into the Land of Earth, because the situation with the Akuta is something he believes will threaten the peace. The reformed Akuta takes a liking to Inojin, so Shikadai thinks it should join them for the moment, as it's evidence of what has been happening, and it's not being aggressive towards them. Since it likes Inojin, he's picked to keep an eye of the Akuta. Boruto continues to dream of his friends, but Garaga intrudes on it to remind him of the agreement between them regarding Mitsuki. Garaga chases Boruto, who is taken away by Mitsuki. Inojin tries bonding with the Akuta, drawing birds for it to chase, but has to intervene when it tries attacking a rabbit. In his dream, Boruto feels the pain where Mitsuki attacked him, and Mitsuki's words encouraging to keep running away make him realise he's dreaming. In his dream, Garaga berates Boruto for clinging to his friends, and running away from betrayal without learning anything. Boruto realises something, thanking Garaga for making him realise it, and wakes up. Shikadai asks for his opinion on their next step. Boruto still wants to go after Mitsuki.

If anything happens to the others, Inojin is to return to Konohagakure with the Akuta as evidence. They hope Ōnoki can help him find out more about the ones Mitsuki left with. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru discuss sending men to Iwagakure, since they can no longer contact Kurotsuchi, despite the risk of igniting a conflict. Konohamaru arrives and requests to be assigned to the mission, even after Naruto stresses the diplomatic implications. Konohamaru disguises himself as an Anbu and departs. Boruto, Sarada, Shikadai, and Chōchō notice no extra security on the main entrance, but decide to follow the water mains on the sides. In the cave where they were left, Inojin makes a grave for a dead animal the Akuta finds. From the normal appearance of things in Iwagakure, Shikadai surmises that Kokuyō was no ordinary shinobi, and is likely affiliated with a clandestine group with no formal ties to Iwagakure. While discussing their next step, Chōchō's stomach growls loudly, drawing attention from the crowd, including Akatsuchi. They draw attention of a diner owner, and get in to eat so Chōchō will stop drawing attention. Their knowledge of Ōnoki impresses the diner owner, and they get him to tell them where Ōnoki lives. Akatsuchi follows them from a distance. Inojin has the Akuta pick a new name for itself, and it picks Akkun. The genin arrive at Ōnoki's residence, and are met by Akatsuchi, who informs them the Hokage told them they might show up, and that Kurotsuchi has disappeared, while a cover story was released. He tells them Ōnoki is probably in the old part of Iwagakure, and that he'll be happy to see someone he invited. Akatsuchi takes them to see Ōnoki, who is happy to see them, but denies being able to help them. After he leaves, the genin and Akatsuchi are attacked by a group of Akuta.

Naruto calls Kurotsuchi's office, and Kontsuchi picks up, informing him that she still hasn't returned and it might be a while before she does, and that there no new developments that require immediate attention. Kontsuchi is being controlled by Kirara through genjutsu. Naruto and Shikamaru suspect something is up, and hope to hear from Konohamaru. On his way to Iwagakure, Konohamaru finds paralysed Konoha shinobi. Akatsuchi demands explanations from Ōnoki. Ōnoki orders Kū to release Boruto, who asks what he meant by for the sake of peace. Ōnoki claims it's to prevent the repeating of a tragedy. Five years prior, Iwagakure was attacked by rogue ninja, and many young shinobi lost their lives. He points out Konoha was also recently attacked, by the Ōtsutsuki. He wants there to be someone to fight these threats instead of risking the lives of the youth, and that Mitsuki will help him with that. Sekiei meets up with Mitsuki, telling him he has to take him to Kū. He shows Mitsuki to his room, and shows them how the Akuta are created. Mitsuki notices there are many, and Sekiei explains they'll soon have more Akuta than there are shinobi in Iwagakure to protect young lives. Mitsuki asks if they'll die in their place. Kokuyō and Kakō arrive, and are displeased with Sekiei showing Mitsuki around. Sekiei takes Mitsuki to see his room, and Kakō volunteers to end Mitsuki already, while Kokuyō wants to wait for further orders. Ōnoki says Mitsuki will help him with the final stage of their plans, but Shikadai points out that if it gets out that he harmed Konoha shinobi, the Hokage will take action. Ōnoki says he planned to do everything in secret, and has no intention of hurting them. Boruto begins fighting Kū, who has the Akuta attack as well. They discover their masks are their weak spot when one of them collapses when Sarada destroys it. Kū imprisons Boruto with an earth barrier, which Akatsuchi breaks with his earth golem. Kū destroys Akatsuchi's golem with Dust Release. The genin want to retreat to their rendezvous point. Kū exchanges blows with Akatsuchi, sending him flying towards a pillar, which collapses on top of Ōnoki's vehicle. Boruto saves Ōnoki. One of the Akuta manages to capture Shikadai.

He asks Mitsuki for confirmation that humans grow stronger when they have someone to protect. Mitsuki is surprised by the question, but confirms it. Sekiei shows him a drawing of them. Shikadai is imprisoned in a cell next to Kurotsuchi. She recognises him as Shikamaru's son, and asks what he'd doing there. Shikadai begins explaining. A doctor arrives for Mitsuki's examination. It reveals the juinjutsu that would destroy Mitsuki to prevent information about Orochimaru's experiments being discovered. Kurotsuchi explains to Shikadai it all started when she rejected one of Ōnoki's proposals in the wake of the attack five years prior. Ōnoki created prototype Akuta to protect the village, but they misbehaved and attack them. Kurotsuchi disavowed their development, as the villages agreed to stand by each other in emergencies, and the Akuta development would jeopardise that. Ōnoki continued his Akuta development in secret, as well as the artificial humans. Kurotsuchi and Shikadai plan to break out. Kū grows impatient with the Akuta being unable to find Ōnoki.

Ōnoki wakes up the next morning, wondering why Boruto saved him. Boruto presses him for further explanation of his plans. Ōnoki insists it's for the sake of peace, and that young shinobi are now weak and unreliable. Boruto decides to leave him, but Ōnoki informs him they're in the Sanzu Plains, which is surrounded by a powerful barrier that makes it difficult to leave once one is inside. Ōnoki explains the plains are a shinobi training ground where one can only leave when they find their heart stone, a simple pebble that requires one to train intensely to find. Boruto tries using shadow clones to find it, but the barrier prevents him from using jutsu, and Ōnoki explains no one else comes to the plains any more, so they're unlikely to be found by third parties. Kokuyō and Kakō report to Kū they have yet to find Ōnoki. Kū wants them to deploy more Akuta for the search, confident that Kirara will be able to keep the villagers from noticing their presence, and dismisses Kakō's suggestion to eliminate witnesses, as that would go against Ōnoki's plan. Kirara shows Mitsuki her belongings. Kakō passes on Kū's orders, and Sekiei explains to Mitsuki Konoha shinobi came looking for him, but Kū chased them away. Mitsuki wants to meet with Kū. Inojin tries teaching Akkun the names of his teammates. Sarada and Chōchō arrive, telling him there are many Akuta around, and are concern when learning that Boruto and Shikadai haven't arrived. Ōnoki gives Boruto food and water as thanks for saving him, and the two continue to forage for sustenance. Ōnoki wants Boruto to admit that book learning during times of peace and plenty has made young shinobi weaker, and Boruto asks if he truly believes they were better off during times of war. Ōnoki stresses that his point is about the value of experience and training, pointing out the presence of powerful enemies like the Ōtsutsuki Boruto himself has fought. Ōnoki explains that is why he created Kū and the others, Kū in particular made from his own cells. He invited Mitsuki to Iwagakure because he was made with similar technology, and could help him further develop synthetic humans to fight instead of risking young lives. Mitsuki meets Kū, who wants to analyse Mitsuki to learn more about how he was created. Mitsuki points out the juinjutsu on his heart, but Kū explains it's an old juinjutsu they can get around of with time. Mitsuki asks Kū about the will of synthetic individuals like themselves, and Kū advises him to ask the who created him. The two continue to discuss the nature of will.

While walking through the plains, Boruto stumbles across Sekki, an Iwagakure genin who failed out early in the last Chūnin Exams. Ōnoki asks what he's doing there, and Sekki explains he's been looking for his Heart Stone. Sekki asks what Boruto is doing there with Ōnoki, but before he can explain Ōnoki's machinations, he assumes Ōnoki did something heroic. Ōnoki later asks Boruto why didn't tell Sekki the truth about him, and Boruto says it'd be no use. Ōnoki tells Sekki Boruto will help him find his Heart Stone, telling Boruto under his breath that if he finds it, they'll be able to leave with Sekki. Sekiei thanks Mitsuki for coming while the two watch over Kirara and Kakō. The doctor reports to Kū that the juinjutsu on Mitsuki's heart is making analysis difficult, and that to make use of the technology behind it, they'd need human hearts for each of the synthetic humans. Kū ponders what to do, as Ōnoki wouldn't approve sacrificing humans for them. Akatsuchi leaves Iwagakure to inform Naruto about what happened, but struggles against pursuing Akuta. Konohamaru saves him. Boruto helps Sekki look for his Heart Stone. The two end up discussing, and Sekki attacks Boruto with his technique that doesn't require chakra. Boruto dodges it easily, but later notices the damage it caused to the rock Sekki hit. When Ōnoki's back gives out, Sekki gives him a back rub, like he used to do for his grandmother. Something in the plains watches the three. Konohamaru determines the area most heavily guarded by the Akuta. The doctor prepares Shikadai for a procedure, but he escapes using his shadow to stop himself from inhaling knockout gas. Sekiei informs Kū that Kirara's genjutsu is failing. Konohamaru infiltrates Iwagakure. When Sekki's resolve begins to falter, Ōnoki passes on words the First Tsuchikage said to him. Boruto and Sekki go get more water, and are attacked by a giant wolf.

The stone he was holding during the attack turns out to be his Heart Stone, its side looking like Sekki's grandmother.

They arrive at a location and Ōnoki explains this is where his grandson Kozuchi died. Kontsuchi is informed of what transpired while he was under genjutsu, and moves to notify the other villages, but Kū and the other synthetic humans have already taken control of Iwagakure with the Akuta. Kū is disappointed by Iwagakure's situation under Kurotsuchi, and leaves the Akuta under Kokuyō's command. Kokuyō informs him Shikadai has escaped, but Kū is more concerned with finding Ōnoki. Ōnoki explains how after the Fourth Shinobi World War, the villages suffered a massive loss of life, but Iwagakure managed to rebuild. Kozuchi was excited to become a genin, and wanted Ōnoki to live long enough to see him become Tsuchikage. Ōnoki told him one who is Tsuchikage must never run away and face every adversity. One day, when some shinobi tried to steal village secrets, Kozuchi tried to stop them and was fatally injured. When Kurotsuchi explained Kozuchi tried to stop them by himself until reinforcements arrived, Ōnoki realised his words were the cause of that attitude, and blamed himself for his death. Wanting to actualise Kozuchi's will, Ōnoki developed the Akuta to fight instead of risking the lives of young shinobi. One day, Ōnoki was approached by a doctor who shared his opinion, and had made a discovery that was a breakthrough for his plan. They created Kū and the other fabrications to lead the Akuta. Ōnoki explains he never intended there to be fighting, and will release the Konoha genin after his plan is completed. Boruto asks him what was the sample that the doctor showed him. Ōnoki reveals it was a White Zetsu. Boruto is incredulous that Ōnoki risked using something so dangerous, and Ōnoki agrees there's much they don't know, and that is why they needed Mitsuki, to stabilise them. Ōnoki assures him that Mitsuki will be free to do as he pleases after they stabilise the synthetic humans. Kū has taken control of Iwagakure and imprisoned those who tried to interfere. Five of the captured shinobi are to be used as sources of hearts for them if Ōnoki approves. Boruto understands Ōnoki's benevolent intentions, but points out that when he fought the synthetic humans, they had personalities, and wonders if they're really different from humans. Ōnoki is confident that what Boruto sees as will in the fabrications are merely functions. Boruto asks if he truly believes that, pointing out how strongly Ōnoki's belief in will is, recalling their conversation in Konohagakure. Ōnoki is taken aback, but assures him he doesn't know about the fabrications. Boruto counters that he knows Mitsuki, and saw how they interacted, and knows Mitsuki has a will, pointing out Ōnoki has no real proof the fabrications lack a will of their own. He asks how different it is from sacrificing real shinobi. The two can't reconcile their beliefs, and Kakō arrives for Ōnoki.\\n\"},\n",

Kū says all is going smoothly according to plan, and Ōnoki questions it, asking where are the villagers and why are there Akuta roaming the streets. Kū claims the situation has changed drastically in his absence, that the Fabrications' lives already beginning to run out, and that he has secured humans from whom to harvest hearts. Boruto questions Ōnoki on what he claimed had been the Fabrications' objective. Ōnoki denounces Kū's actions as the opposite of his will, as he intends to sacrifice young lives instead of saving them. Kū shows him his deterioration, but Ōnoki orders him to release those in his custody. Kū questions Ōnoki's commitment to his own plan and his willingness to sacrifice the Fabrications, and knocks him out.

Shikadai says there's another jutsu Inojin can use, but Inojin isn't sure it'll work on him. Shikadai says it's what they have. Shikadai uses himself as bait, and Inojin is able to take over Kokuyō's body with the Mind Body Switch Technique. Kokuyō is able to force Inojin out and dodge Chōchō's Human Bullet Tank. He moves to attack Inojin, but Akkun obstructs his vision, giving them another shot. Kokuyō destroys Akkun's mask when dealing with him, but receives a heavy hit from Chōchō. Kokuyō can't understand how humans endanger themselves to fight, and Shikadai explains they make up with other kinds of strength, such as strength of heart.

Team 10 is exhausted after fighting Kokuyō and wonder how Boruto and Sarada are faring. Caught in Kirara's genjutsu, she controls their movements like a puppeteer. Sarada tries breaking the genjutsu on Boruto with her Sharingan, but Kirara forces him to close his eyes. She wants to play with them like they're dolls, drawing out their injuries. Ōnoki ponders on Boruto's assessment of the Fabrications' will and Kū's own words and actions. He thinks back to first meeting and naming Kū, as well as the other four Fabrications. Ōnoki tries leaving his room, but his path is blocked by an Akuta. The doctor tends to Sekiei's deterioration, and Sekiei asks him how their lives will be after receiving hearts. He's not concerned about being strong, but with protecting his friends. The doctor leaves Sekiei alone with Mitsuki. Sekiei tells Mitsuki he heard of Kokuyō's and Kakō's deaths, and recounts his feelings about it. He asks Mitsuki how that'll change once he has a heart, and Mitsuki explains having a heart doesn't make one human. Mitsuki relays Kū's orders to the doctor. Having made back from the Sanzu Plains, Sekki has been avoiding the Akuta, and runs into Akatsuchi, who updates him on what has happened. As all other shinobi have been imprisoned, Akatsuchi tasks Sekki with rescuing Ōnoki. Mitsuki shows Sekiei a completed artificial heart. An Akuta updates Kirara on their heart situation. Not wanting to miss it, she makes Boruto and Sarada stop holding back as she leaves. Sarada is able to put herself under a new genjutsu by looking at her Sharingan's reflection on Boruto's sword, then breaks the genjutsu on him. As Mitsuki is about to deliver Kū his heart, Boruto and Sarada arrive. Mitsuki holds them at bay with a Lightning Release, and Kū binds their movement with an Earth Release. Boruto tries appealing to Mitsuki not to help Kū. Mitsuki hands Kū the heart, and while he celebrates, Mitsuki strikes him from behind. Kū drops the heart, revealed to be disguised snakes. All are shocked by the betrayal. They hear explosions from afar, those being Konohamaru destroying the Akuta production site as arranged with Mitsuki. Kurotsuchi frees the captured Iwagakure shinobi. Ōnoki manages to escape his room. Team 7 faces against the remaining Fabrications.\\n\"},\n",

Kū departs to get medical attention, but Sekiei prevents Boruto from following him with Explosive Clay. Mitsuki wants Boruto and Sarada to go after Kū while he deals with Sekiei, who is furious with him. Kirara blocks Boruto and Sarada with Akuta. Mitsuki tries to dissuade Sekiei from fighting so his body doesn't break down any further. Sekiei attacks Mitsuki, all the while accusing him of pretending to be his friend. Boruto and Sarada destroy a few of Kirara's Akuta, whose body begins to break down as well. Kirara brings out a gigantic Akuta to kill Boruto and Sarada. Boruto summons Garaga to help. In between discussing with Boruto, Garaga fights the giant Akuta. Sarada moves against Kirara, managing to distract her with a Sharingan genjutsu, giving herself an opening to land a Lightning Release attack on her. Kirara orders the giant Akuta to save her, but Garaga constricts it until it breaks down, one of its chunks crushing her instead. Sekiei continues to attack Mitsuki while throwing accusations at him, who denounces Kū's path, but thinks Sekiei can still be saved. Sekiei manages to get Mitsuki to fight back by threatening to kill Boruto. Mitsuki disables Sekiei's Explosive Clay with his Lightning Release. Sekki finds Ōnoki sneaking out, and explains he was sent by Akatsuchi. Kū reaches the doctor, but is informed the donors escaped, so he decides to get the doctor's heart.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Kū revels in his new power. The Konoha genin consider him too dangerous to be left unchecked. On their way to the Old City, Sekki needs a break, but Ōnoki spots the recent damage to the old Tsuchikage office, and thinking of Kozuchi, says this is a moment he can't miss. Kū fights Mitsuki, trapping him with stone pillars, saying they should see eye to eye as they're both man-made. Sarada and Boruto disagree with him, Kū using a sword to knock Boruto back. When Boruto says Mitsuki never intended to truly join them, Kū claims that Mitsuki had many opportunities to ask for help while in Konoha, but didn't, instead going to meet other artificial humans like himself. When Mitsuki hesitates in denying it, Kū takes it as proof, saying Boruto never noticed his struggle, and because of it he can't claim to be Mitsuki's friend. When Kū readies a Dust Release to use against Boruto, Mitsuki breaks free of the stone pillars with Sage Mode, and goes on the offensive. The falling debris traps Boruto and Sarada inside. In Konoha, Shikamaru is stressed trying to get official permission to enter the Land of Earth. Naruto notices Sai is also stressed, which he attributes Inojin also being there. Wasabi eavesdrops on them, and informs Teams 15 and 5. They want to go help their friends, but have been ordered to stay put. Naruto prepares to depart, and Teams 5 and 15 request permission to go with him. Naruto refuses to endanger their lives, but they're willing to face the consequences of going without his permission. Naruto appreciates their dedication, and Sai and Shikamaru don't stop them from following. Sarada works on clearing the debris. Boruto admits they should get to know more of Mitsuki, but Sarada says they've done enough. The rest the debris gets cleared by Sekki, who explains Ōnoki is with him. He asks Boruto to take him to Kū. Kū is impressed with Mitsuki's Sage Mode, and wants to use his body to create more Fabrications. Mitsuki constricts Kū with snakes, but he creates a golem to wield his sword and cut through the snakes, which forces Mitsuki out of Sage Mode. Kū prepares to further weaken Mitsuki, but Ōnoki arrives with Boruto and Sarada. Ōnoki asks Kū when he strayed from protecting the weak, and Kū says he's merely a vessel for the hatred Ōnoki passed down to him. Kū prepares to kill the others, but they escape to an underground stream. Ōnoki recalls Ishikawa's warning of his Will of Stone being replaced with hatred. He wakes up in that same room. Boruto asks Mitsuki if he found what he's looking for. Mitsuki explains what Ōnoki told him, that he's seen many things since leaving the village, and that while he's not sure if he's empty, he is sure of his will. Boruto says he and Sarada want to know the real him, and gives him back his forehead protector. Mitsuki wants to lure Kū away while they take Ōnoki away, as there are clones of him, but Boruto says the one in front of him is Mitsuki. Kū arrives at their location. Boruto distracts him with shadow clones. Kū takes control of the debris, using it to destroy Boruto's clones. Sarada destroys a boulder coming at Boruto. The genin struggle against Kū, while Ōnoki despairs at young lives being at risk again. Sarada uses her Sharingan to dodge Kū's boulders, and he prepares a Dust Release attack. Sarada and Mitsuki attack it with their own ninjutsu, using its explosion as a smokescreen to get to him, holding his arms apart so he can't weave hand seals. He throws them aside as Boruto throws himself at Kū, who punches him with a rock gauntlet, revealing it as a shadow clone, the real Boruto coming after him, and landing a Rasengan on Kū's heart. A weakened Kū prepares a giant Dust Release to finish them off, but Ōnoki counters it with one of his own. Ōnoki admits he allowed his commitment to Kozuchi's will to be twisted, and that he must set it right, his Dust Release overpowering Kū's, killing him and taking a substantial part of the building with it. Sekki finds them. Ōnoki gives them his final words and passes away. Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi arrive with Naruto and other Konoha shinobi by sunset. Konohamaru says he'll give his report to Naruto, and hugs Mitsuki. Mitsuki apologises for giving them so much trouble, thinking he won't be allowed back in the village, but Teams 5 and 15 arrive, all glad Mitsuki is ok.\\n\"},\n",

Mitsuki is confined to a different railcar, under supervision of Sai and Konohamaru. Boruto wishes he could have talked to Mitsuki before being separated. Shikadai tries to distract Inojin from Akkun's death. Besides the Five Kage and high ranking Iwagakure officials, many villagers come to pay their respects. Boruto and Sarada return home to their worried families. Back at the village, Naruto wants to praise Boruto and Sarada for standing up for Mitsuki, but Sai and Shikamaru point out he can't, so as punishment, he means to remove their genin rank. They ask about Mitsuki, and are told he's still being debriefed, as there's a lot of intel only he knows. Naruto has them leave their forehead protectors. Sai and Konohamaru debrief Mitsuki, and ask him why he chose against informing anyone in the village of his plans. Sarada is concerned Mitsuki will be blamed for the situation in Iwagakure and be forced to leave, or that he might chose to leave on his own. Boruto has faith in Mitsuki. While asleep, he is mentally contacted by Garaga, since Mitsuki being back in the village marks the end of their contract. They exchange words and bid each other farewell. Sarada wakes him up, and informs him Mitsuki's debriefing is over. The two look for him. Mitsuki makes small memorials for the Fabrications. Boruto finds him, and Mitsuki apologises for the hurt he's caused. Boruto recalls Ōnoki's words, and tells Mitsuki there are many sides to his will, and that his questions are a natural part of it. Sarada arrives and they share a laugh. Orochimaru discusses Mitsuki's development with Log, who informs him the body of the scientist responsible for developing the Fabrications has gone missing. They wonder who might be responsible. Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki walk through the village, and hear the official account of the situation of Iwagakure in the news. Boruto thinks he spots a Heart Stone in the river, but cries when he remembers Ōnoki's teachings. As their sensei, Konohamaru wants to take responsibility for their actions, but before they can decide anything, Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi arrive from Iwagakure, and want to personally thank the Konoha genin for their actions, adding they'll always consider them shinobi at Iwagakure. Naruto understands what she means, Team 7 has their genin status reinstated, and they prepare for their next mission.\\n\"},\n",

Chōji watches the announcement of the Parent and Child Day holiday on tv, keeps on flicking through channels and eating. Seeing her father, Chōchō asks Karui why she married him. Karui doesn't quite remember, and gets angry with him for having eaten by himself the snacks she had bought for them to have together. Karui throws him out when he asks her to buy more chips when she goes out to replenish the snacks. Chōji and Chōchō run into Boruto, and they explain their situation. Chōchō spots an advert for a Parent and Child Day eating contest, and wants to enter it with her father, so he can prove to Karui he's a role model for their daughter. At the contest, they also find Sai and Inojin, Rock Lee, Metal Lee, Shikamaru and Shikadai participating as well. Chōji and Chōchō advance to the second round, and are surprised when another team ties with them. The Nara and Yamanaka also advance to the second round. The team who tied with the Akimichi, the Dōtonbori, introduce themselves and boast that they'll win. The Akimichi, the Dōtonbori, and the Nara advance to the semi-finals. One of the cooks watches them, and later conspires with the Dōtonbori, afraid that Chōji will make her shop go bankrupt if he wins. The Dōtonbori and the Akimichi advance to the finals. Karui watches the contest, and Boruto spots Shino in the audience with his Kurama doll. While the Akimichi recover, Karui expresses her doubts over the value of the eating contest and their recklessness. Boruto wants to try the spicy burgers from the semi-finals, and manages to find leftovers of the Dōtonbori, but finds them not to be spicy at all. During the final, the conspiring cook put shallow bowls for the Dōtonbori to give them an advantage. Boruto brings them their meal in the regular bowls. Chōchō struggles to finish the dishes by herself, and reminds Chōji that delicious meals are meant to be eaten together, something Karui also shouts from the audience. With new found determination, the Akimichi catch up to the Dōtonbori. The cook interferes using ninjutsu to cause their dumplings to grow. Rock and Metal try to deal with it, but are ineffective. Karui uses Lightning Release to release her daughter, but it takes Chōji growing in size to end the issue by eating them all, and then burning through the calories by converting them into chakra.

Sarada tells her not to worry, as Sasuke isn't there either, and she promised to help Boruto with shuriken training. She wonders where Sasuke is, unaware he is in Konohagakure. Boruto recognises Sasuke on the street, who asks him about all the family activities. Boruto explains the new holiday, Sasuke asks about Naruto, and Boruto adds he's with Himawari today, before telling Sasuke where Sarada will be, and suggesting he spend time with her. Waiting by a stream, Sasuke thinks back to times he spent with his father, when he mastered the Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. Sarada is surprised to find him. Sasuke explains he just got to the village, that Boruto told him where she'd be, and invites her to go to festivals. Sarada is happy that Sasuke came to the village, but he explains he dropped by because he had business to attend near the village, cutting down her excitement. Watching other parents with their children, Sasuke struggles to bond with Sarada. The two spot Naruto carrying Himawari as they search for a Kurama doll, Sarada envious of their bond. He thinks back to how he enjoyed being carried by Itachi, and offers to carry her, but she finds it embarrassing and walks off. Kakashi approaches Sasuke, pointing out all his time alone have dulled his social skills, and suggests Sasuke take hints from the Icha Icha books. Sasuke comes across Shino dotting on his Kurama doll, and after an awkward silence, he asks about Sarada. Shino comments on her talent and the difficult path she has chosen. Sasuke asks about any parasites on her, which Shino misunderstands as a negative comment on insects. When he talks to Sarada again, he tries using Kakashi's advice from the books, but ends up further antagonising her. Boruto finds Sarada training by herself, and asks her about Sasuke. She confesses she doesn't think her father knows her at all, but Boruto surprises her asking if she knows Sasuke at all, and that she should tell him if there's something she wants to do. Sasuke complains to Kakashi about his advice, and the two come across Sakura. At home, the two talk about how Sarada perceives Sasuke, and Sakura explains Sarada wants to be Hokage. He finds her training with shuriken, and explains that once he too wanted to be Hokage, but his version of it was warped until Naruto set him on the right path. Sasuke helps her with her shuriken training. On their way home, they come across Boruto, and Sarada gives him the same advice he gave her. At home, Naruto apologises to Boruto for having spent the whole day with Himawari, and gifts him the parent and child kunai set he bought at Tenten's shop. Boruto asks Naruto to train with him since it's still technically Parent and Child Day. At his home, Shino continues dotting on his Kurama doll.\\n\"},\n",

A deflected shuriken cuts Namida, who asserts she can fight and begins to well up. Taking notice, her team-mates cover their ears, and Namida cries out, knocking out all their enemies, and the merchants they're supposed to protect. The three praise her jutsu, but Namida gets flustered. In the Information & Receiving Centre, Wasabi and Sumire inform Namida the doctors have cleared them, and Team 7 congratulate them for defeating the Garakuta Gang. When Wasabi and Sumire don't respond, Namida explains they lost their hearing because of her jutsu. Mitsuki points out that if this keeps happening, Namida might get her team-mates killed, prompting her to decide training with new jutsu. Namida practices Water Release, surprising her team-mates, but her jutsu lacks the power to even damage the target. Sumire suggests reevaluating using her Calling on Tears Technique, but Namida insists on using new jutsu and asks Hanabi for help. Hanabi considers chakra control to be the issue and has Sumire use her own Water Release, which does destroy the target. Hanabi explains that when her emotions take over and she begins to cry, that disrupts her focus. She asks Hanabi to teach her. Hanabi has Namida try to mould her chakra while dodging her attacks, using her Byakugan to evaluate her chakra control, but Namida is unable to do it. Next, she has Namida try increasing the distance of her attack, Wasabi and Sumire slightly scared of Hanabi. Hanabi explains how she can modify her jutsu and her Water Release's reach increases. Next, Hanabi wants Namida to knock over a thick log, to train the power behind her jutsu. Sumire and Wasabi decide to train harder as well in solidarity to Namida. The next day, Namida spars against them and continues to improve. Their next mission is once again to guard the same merchants, who are now in possession of a historical document by the First Hokage. The Garakuta Gang members recognise Team 15, warning their leader about them. They fight, but Namida's Water Release has little effect on their water clones. One of the assailants pressures her into close quarters, but Sumire uses Nue, who grows bigger, to intervene. The rest of the group uses the distraction to flee with their merchandise. Hanabi orders the girls to stay behind protecting the merchants, while she goes after the Garakuta Gang. Sumire sends Nue to aid her. Namida is frustrated that her Water Release was useless against them. One of the merchants reveals they still have the First Hokage's document, but the Garakuta leader reveals himself, glad to have stuck around. Sumire wants to the other two to run away with the merchants, but Namida intercepts a shuriken meant for her. The Garakuta leader sinks them into the ground with an Earth Release. Namida blames herself for their situation, but her team-mates point out she has gotten stronger. The gang leader takes the document and considers it lucky Namida didn't cry. Namida decides to cry, so the gang leader runs away. Wasabi encourages her to cry, and remembering the focus of her training, she applies it to her Calling on Tears Technique, increasing its power and reach, and narrowing its focus, managing to hit the Garakuta leader. Free from his jutsu, Sumire summons Nue, whose disappearance alerts Hanabi of their fight. Wasabi and Nue attack the remnants of the gang, who try to flee. Namida tries using her jutsu again, but having spent so much chakra, she's unable to focus it again, knocking everyone out. Hanabi thinks Namida still has ways to go. Meeting Team 7 again, they congratulate them again and question their most recent hearing loss, but Namida explains how she used her cry to protect them instead.\\n\"},\n",

A month prior, Temari is invited to attend a banquet where important Land of Wind figures will meet. Enchū discusses politics and appearances with Shikamaru, and presses on the need of Shikadai's improvement with the Nara's shadow jutsu, which Shikadai overhears. After he leaves, Shikadai asks his father why he puts up with Enchū, who in turn explains they've been indebted to the clan elder since Shikaku's time. In the present, Shikadai's genin friends discuss his struggles at the Lightning Burger. Boruto questions why Shikadai doesn't use Wind Release any more, and Shikadai and Denki relate to feeling under pressure due to family affairs. Team 10 is left on standby regarding an upcoming delegation from the Land of Wind to visit a power plant like the one they've defended. Later that day, Shikadai learns his team was put on standby because of a request put in by Enchū, who wants to prevent Shikadai from jeopardising the clan's reputation, and instead counsels him to get into politics. Enchū agrees to stop meddling with Shikamaru if Shikadai agrees to his proposal. When Shikadai brings it up with his family, Temari is surprised by it, but Shikamaru supports him, on the condition he's doing that for himself. Shikadai informs Moegi and his friends about his decision. Shikadai visits the wind power plant he protected with Denki, who helps maintain their systems. Shikadai informs Denki of his intended career change, but before they can discuss it, an issue arises with one of the batteries due to the structure damage. While Denki tries fixing the problem, he tells Shikadai how he intends to use his situation to improve the village. When Denki's solution doesn't work, he speculates there must be a cut wire. One of the windmill turbines connected to the affected battery can resolve the situation, so Shikadai uses Wind Release to turn it, allowing Denki to fix the issue. A part of the ceiling collapses, but Shikadai saves Denki with his Shadow Imitation Technique. Shikadai decides he won't be a politician after all. He informs his parents, and asks Temari to teach him proper Wind Release. Enchū arrives with forms for Shikadai to sign, but he tells him he changed his mind. Enchū is done with them.

Boruto notices what appears to be a peeping tom, and startles him with a kunai, causing him to fall from a tree. They notice him holding a nest of eggs, and apologise to him while tending his fall. Tosaka demonstrates his expertise, identifying the eggs by licking them. Tosaka returns the nest to the tree, and explains how genes determine species' traits. When Boruto says he's more than his genes, Tosaka asks to lick him, and the genin leave. Konohamaru explains Hanabi is aiding with border patrol due to an apparent infiltration, so he'll lead both teams. Suika Kannonji tasks them with investigating bird attacks in village near the forests in the outskirts of the Land of Fire. As they don't have experience with birds, Tosaka was assigned to provide assistance. On their way, Sarada is disgusted when Tosaka licks bird droppings to confirm their diet. Team 15 plans to leverage their experience from a previous animal related mission. The group spends the following day researching, with Wasabi using her Cat Covering cover ground. Near the village, Tosaka notices a lack of bird chirping. They rescue a villager being attacked. Boruto is approached by a fully transformed and berserk Jūgo. Jūgo pins him down near a ledge, but is pushed down a river by Nue. Boruto thanks Sumire. The two return to the group, who is tending to the villager's injuries, and alert them of the monster they fought. Namida notices something with Sumire. They notice the villager's breathing is getting shallower, and his temperature is rising. They arrive at the village, and Tosaka speculates it's bird-borne disease. A village elder explains the birds began changing a month ago, destroying crops and attacking people, and also beastly cries can be heard from the forest. They add the first to change were the water fowls, from the river that comes from the mountain, runs along the village, and flows into the Land of Rivers. Konohamaru advises them to stay away from the river, and use only well water for their needs. A pattern starts appearing where the villager was injured, and Konohamaru is shown other villagers with the same spreading pattern. The villagers bring an unconscious Jūgo who was found by the river. Sarada and Mitsuki recognise him, and Jūgo claims he slipped an fell into the river when he wakes up. Nue is apprehensive of him. One of the sick villagers wakes up and attacks Tosaka. Konohamaru has the genin evacuate the villagers while he deals with the berserk villager. Jūgo lures the villager and knocks him out, concealing a partial transformation, and tells Boruto to stay away from the forest before leaving. Mitsuki notices the villager no longer has the pattern on him. Konohamaru explains the nature of Cursed Seals to the genin, and is suspicious of Jūgo's involvement due to his association with Orochimaru, who uses Cursed Seals. The group splits to cover more ground. Boruto throws a rock to confirm a suspicion he had based on the villager's testimony, that the cries were echos. They determine the source of the sound, a cave entrance with a door. They find Jūgo struggling to contain his transformation at the end of the cave, and Boruto recognises him as the monster who attacked him, warning Sarada they need to flee. Jūgo turns around announcing he'll kill them.\\n\"},\n",

Konohamaru berates them for not contacting him right away, and explains that Jūgo is under a complete Cursed Seal Transformation and running on killing instinct. Konohamaru fights Jūgo with the genin providing ranged backup, but Jūgo shrugs off all attacks. He grabs Konohamaru and begins absorbing his chakra. Konohamaru lands a Rasengan on his face, which sends him to the ground. Jūgo's transformation partially recedes, and seeing Konohamaru drained on the ground, he walks away. The genin follow Jūgo, discussing the appropriate course of action, while Jūgo tells them to stay away. They find Jūgo passed out by a body of water with many birds, his transformation fully receded. Konohamaru arrives with the Team 15 girls and Tosaka, and notices an injection device near Jūgo. Tosaka examines Jūgo to compare his condition with what they saw happen to the birds, and comments on finding the natural habitat of an endangered bird species. Jūgo wakes up, and when an afflicted bird attacks them, he removes their cursed seal. Jūgo refuses to answer Boruto's question, handing him the kunai he used to kill birds earlier. They take an injured Konohamaru back to the village, but Boruto conceals the events until they have more information. Konohamaru says he should be good after four or five days of rest. Wasabi is concerned he could have contracted the Cursed Seal through his wounds like the birds did, but Tosaka explains he took Jūgo's blood and discovered his cursed seal and the birds' are different. Konohamaru asks Mitsuki about the device he found, and Mitsuki confirms it's from Orochimaru's research, with Tosaka adding it's a powerful tranquilliser, having licked it. Mitsuki speculates it's a drug to suppress the cursed seal. Konohamaru instructs Team 15 to report back to Konoha and request backup, and Team 7 to keep an eye on Jūgo from a distance, and look out for more cursed seal suppressing drugs. Team 7 and Tosaka observe Jūgo removing a bird's cursed seal, but struggles to keep it contained in his own body. Tosaka is touched by his love for birds. Jūgo ignores Boruto's apology and goes back to his cave, where he undergoes a transformation in a room he can't get out of while transformed. Jūgo insists they should leave, despite their intent to help him, but relents when he sees they won't give up. He explains the birds infected with the cursed seal have red eyes even before getting violent. They ask Tosaka about the cursed seal, and he says that because the species is very territorial, finding out where they come from should give them a hint. They come across Land of Rivers researchers who are also investigating the bird attacks. When they ask to share information, Boruto lies and says they've only just began investigating, so they have nothing to share. Jūgo asks him why he didn't tell the researchers about him, and Boruto says they can't save the birds without him. Jūgo senses another transformation coming, and is unable to give himself the tranquilliser. Boruto administers it. After the episode passes, Boruto insists on helping him, as he's the only one who can help the birds. Jūgo trusts him with more doses of the tranquilliser. On their way back to Konoha, Team 15 is attacked by two siblings, who use some sort of device to activate cursed seals. Team 7, Jūgo, and Tosaka discuss their lack of progress, and wonder if something else is afoot. They're spied on by one of the Land of Rivers researchers, who reports on observing Jūgo.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Jūgo removes the cursed seal from infected birds before they go rampage and tags them. Boruto wishes they could do it as well to offer Jūgo some relief. Sarada and Mitsuki arrive, reporting the last places around they have to look for infected birds. They'll check on those while Boruto remains watching Jūgo. Sarada reminds Jūgo to take his injection, and explains to Tosaka she convinced him to take it at regular intervals to avoid transformations. Jūgo adds that though it helps, taking it regularly dulls his senses, and makes it harder to remove the birds' cursed seals. Boruto spots what Tosaka identifies as a domesticated goose that probably wandered off, and Tosaka reminds him about their conversation on genes, saying the species lost their ability to fly. Jūgo determines the goose isn't infected, and compares its inability to fly with his inability to have a normal life because of his cursed seal. Jūgo is concerned with removing the cursed seals before the wild geese migrate, which would spread the infection. At the end of the day, Jūgo still goes back to his cave, as his body is building up a resistance to the injections, which won't be useful for much longer. Boruto and Sarada look at how many shots they still have, and wonder what they'll do when they run out. They're spied on by the Land of Rivers researchers. Their effort continues through the next couple days. On the third day, they're woken up by bird sounds, and discover the infected birds have been set free. Tosaka claims the geese underwent transformation and escaped, which Jūgo going after them. They find Jūgo struggling to contain his transformation. Sarada goes back for his shots, but finds they're missing, even in the cave. She arrives back to the group just in time for Jūgo's transformation to complete. They dodge his first attack, and he blocks Mitsuki's kunai. Boruto distracts him with a Rasengan while a clone gives them cover with a smoke bomb. Jūgo disappears in the smoke, and they realise he's headed for the village. Jūgo destroys a building, and almost kills a villager, but is hit with tranquilliser shots by the Land of Rivers research group. They restrain Jūgo, and the village headman thanks them. The headman explains he called them just in case, and as Jūgo's transformation recedes, feels deceived because the Konoha shinobi knew of his identity and withheld it. The researchers want to take over the situation, and they explain their friends went to get back up. They show them an unconscious Namida and Wasabi, both infected with the cursed seal. Sarada asks about Sumire, but Momo and Sasami claim they only found the two. Hidden in a tree with Nue on watch, Sumire thinks back to Team 15's battle. Momo and Sasami easily defeated Wasabi and Namida with their cursed seals, and infected them. Sumire summoned Nue to help them, but instead he fled with Sumire. The Land of Rivers researchers begin to set up, and request Tosaka to lend his expertise. Boruto wants to stay, but the village headman rescinds his request for help. Tosaka assures them he'll take care of Jūgo and the birds. Boruto feels frustrated.\\n\"},\n",

The Land of Rivers researchers prepare to begin experimenting on Jūgo. Sumire and Nue look for Namida and Wasabi, but run into Karin and Suigetsu. Nue attacks Suigetsu, who retaliates. Team 7 hears the ruckus of their confrontation. Suigetsu's counterattack is enough to cause Nue's summoning to end. Team 7 arrives, Mitsuki and Sarada recognising Suigetsu and Karin before Boruto can attack. They tend to Sumire, and Suigetsu explains they're there to take Jūgo back to Orochimaru. Team 7 explains Jūgo's situation, and Suigetsu decides to get him back from the researchers, so as information on his cursed seal and connection to Orochimaru remain concealed. Suigetsu is unconcerned by Jūgo's efforts to save the birds, annoying Boruto, pointing out Boruto has just met him, while Suigetsu has known him for years. Boruto requests they wait until Sumire wakes up, so she can tell them what she knows about Wasabi and Namida's cursed seal infections. Karin and Sarada catch up with each other, and Karin wants Sumire to bite her for healing. Mitsuki teases Suigetsu. Jūgo wakes up and Tosaka explains where they are. Suigetsu explains to Boruto that Jūgo has tried to overcome his destiny before, but has come to accept it. Boruto counters he knows someone who is trying their hardest to live the way they want, and compares that to Jūgo's commitment to helping the birds despite the risks. Mitsuki informs them Sumire is awake. Sumire tells them of the twins with cursed seals wearing collars, who Boruto remembers as part of the Land of Rivers research them. Sumire speculates they're doing something they don't want discovered. Suigetsu believes they're after Jūgo's cursed seal. Karin decides everyone should collaborate, lest unfavourable reports are made to Konoha, that would eventually reach Orochimaru due to their involvement. Sarada and Karin will lure the twins away, so the others can go in and rescue everyone else. Momo and Sasami boast about their cursed seals to a restrained Wasabi and Namida. The research leader tells them to clean up their mess, and sends them after Sumire. They spot her, actually a transformed Sarada. Sumire will look for her team-mates, Mitsuki will look for Konohamaru, Boruto and Suigetsu will look for Jūgo. Sasami finds Sumire's movements suspicious. Boruto and Suigetsu run into Tosaka, Sumire finds the girls, who inform her the serum on the desk will remove their cursed seals. Boruto updates Tosaka and asks where Jūgo is. The Land of Rivers research leader tries to assassinate Konohamaru, but Mitsuki got to him in time. Sarada drops her disguise and is joined by Karin, but only Sasami reaches them. Momo doubles back and comes across Team 15. Tosaka takes Boruto and Suigetsu to where Jūgo is, and uses tranquillisers on them as they try to free him, welcoming them to his research lab.\\n\"},\n",

Sasami and Momo activate their cursed seals to fight Karin and Sarada, and Team 15 respectively. Tosaka tells Boruto and Suigetsu their friends won't be coming to save them. He explains the mission was a lie from the start, as he had no choice but to join them, the men he had sent before being captured at the border. Tosaka is glad to have been able to observe Jūgo up close, his goal being acquiring Jūgo's cursed seal. Boruto admonishes Tosaka for treating Jūgo like a research subject, who in turn retorts Boruto himself stressed to importance of dreams, his being creating the ultimate cursed seal weapon. Suigetsu covertly turns his arm into water while Tosaka is distracted. Tosaka explains he had to bait Jūgo out, so he infected the birds. Suigetsu attempts to free Jūgo, but is tasered by other Land of Rivers researchers before succeeding. The head researcher announces preparations to leave with Jūgo. As a demonstration for Boruto, Tosaka injects Jūgo with a special drug. Sumire baits Momo with a water clone and attacks him from a distance. Momo points out she left her friends vulnerable, and striking the ground, sends a lot of debris their way. Sumire protects them with a water wall, but a few rocks go through it. Momo criticises her split focus, and tells her to use her summon. Sumire summons Nue, but it's still small due to her depleted chakra. Sarada warns Karin that Sasami's bite will infect her with a cursed seal, and tracks Sasami's movements with her Sharingan. Sumire protects Nue from Momo, distracting him long enough for Namida to hit him with her improved Calling on Tears Technique. Wasabi joins in the attack with her Cat Covering, exciting Momo with the prospect of a more interesting fight. Sarada struggles with depleting chakra, but Karin is able to lock on Sasami's chakra, showing them where Sasami will attack from. Sasami still knocks Sarada out, but Karin uses her chakra chains to restrain her. Karin wants Sarada to bite her for healing, reasoning that her chains won't hold forever, wanting Sarada to still be able to fight. Karin reveals that long ago Sakura saved her life, and uses Sarada's reaction to it to make her bite her arm, asking Sarada to tell Sakura she has repaid her debt. Karin informs Sarada where Sasami will attack from, allowing Sarada to land a full hit on her, defeating her and destroying her cursed seal collar. Jūgo slowly transforms, and Tosaka explains the drug he used is meant to trigger his transformation, as he wants to witness his full power, despite Boruto's warning that not even he will be safe. Mitsuki reports to Konohamaru, who decides against regrouping, and instead wants to go to the alleged researchers' boat downriver, where he believes they can find something to stop the infection. Momo defeats Namida and Wasabi, so Sumire distracts him with a water clone again to get them to safety. Despite Sumire's reservations, she agrees to let Namida and Wasabi have their chakra drained by Nue, so it can grow big again, strong enough to defeat Momo. A restored Nue goes up against Momo, with an assist from Sumire. They're able to defeat Momo and break his cursed seal collar. Sumire has to stop Nue from draining Momo's chakra. The other researchers check in on Tosaka, and attempt to kill Jūgo to prevent his transformation. Tosaka kills them instead with his cursed seal. On their way to the village, Sarada notices dawn is approaching, and changes course, concerned the wild geese will start to migrate, spreading the infection. Boruto can move again and begins to free Jūgo. Tosaka attempts to stop him, but is stopped by Suigetsu's enlarged arm. Commenting on his jutsu, Tosaka tasers Suigetsu again. Jūgo tells Boruto to flee, while his transformation proceeds and he breaks free of his bonds.\\n\"},\n",

Jūgo begs Boruto to flee while breaking free, while Tosaka yearns to witness Jūgo's full power. His transformation proceeding, Jūgo flees and Boruto follows. Sarada informs Karin the infected birds have red eyes, and the two begin trying to isolate them. Team 15 arrives by the lake, and Sarada requests their help. Boruto tries following Jūgo, but is still feeling the effects of the tranquilliser, so Tosaka overtakes him in the pursuit. Jūgo arrives at the lake shore, followed by Tosaka, who is ecstatic at the prospect of the birds spreading the cursed seal, which would give him more samples to study. Boruto arrives with shadow clones, attacking Tosaka with explosive tag kunai, but he shrugs them off, fully transforming, and capturing Boruto and his clones with extra arms and a tail. Tosaka begins losing his patience waiting for Jūgo to fight him, and dismisses Boruto's concerns about Jūgo. Jūgo fully transforms, makes short work of Tosaka, and absorbs his cursed seal before tossing him aside. Karin, Sarada, and Team 15 struggle to find all the infected birds, and Karin says they should consider just killing all the birds. Jūgo continues to rampage and attacks Boruto. Suigetsu drags himself to the lake, still weak from the tranquilliser and taser shocks, complaining that Jūgo should rampage closer by. Tosaka tells Boruto Jūgo will probably rampage until he dies. Nue saves Boruto from Jūgo's attack, and keeps on attacking him, against Sumire's orders. She tries to intervene, but Boruto warns her she'll get caught up in the attacks, and that they have to find a different way. Tosaka continues to muse of genetically determined fates, but Boruto ignores him. Karin is concerned Sarada can't bring herself to cull the birds, but Sarada says she should be the one to do it, as the mission was assigned to her team. Boruto tells Sumire that Konohamaru managed to revert Jūgo's transformation by inflicting significant damage with his Rasengan, and that he doesn't think he can make one strong enough to cause such damage. Boruto notices the speed Jūgo is charging at in his attacks, and speculates that if he comes at him at that speed, he might damage him enough to revert the transformation. Jūgo tosses Nue aside, and Boruto draws his attention. Boruto builds up speed using one Boruto Stream on top of another, and lands a Rasengan, but Jūgo's transformation doesn't revert. The domesticated goose flies by at the last second, and Jūgo's transformation recedes. Tosaka passes out considering it ridiculous. The sun comes up, and Sarada prepares to kill the birds. Mitsuki stops her, and Konohamaru arrives with Suigetsu, showing her the serum to neutralise the cursed seal they stole from the enemy's base. Suigetsu consumes the serum, merges with the lake's water, and rains it down on the birds, curing them. The domesticated goose struggles and manages to fly with the wild ones. Sumire makes a decision, and informs Namida and Wasabi she intends to join the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team to find a better way to synergise with Nue through science, and asks them not to tell the others yet, wanting to do it herself. Konohamaru considers the mission a success, but is exasperated when Mitsuki informs him Karin and Suigetsu took Tosaka with them when they left. Suigetsu teases Karin about feeling maternal towards Sarada. Sarada tells Boruto he was reckless, and Boruto retorts it worked. They wonder what will Jūgo do, and Jūgo, seeing the domesticated goose fly, wonders if he'll fly some day.\\n\"},\n",

Kōtarō Fūma and the police pursue Nezumi, a jewel thief, aided by Team 7. Nezumi disappears just as the two groups are about to corner him, leading them to a group of drunks. Thinking Nezumi is among them in disguise, Kōtarō apprehends all of them to clear them one by one. Team 7 believes the mission to be over, and find a kitten, lost and shaking. Sarada's building doesn't allow pets, and Boruto has to ask his mother permission, so Mitsuki ends up responsible for the kitten. On his way home, a passerby tells Mitsuki should hold it in a gentler manner. Sarada and Boruto discuss whether Mitsuki will know how to take care of it, Sarada wishing Boruto had taken it. He says he might convince their parents if Himawari supports him. At Mitsuki's home, the kitten quickly gets stuck in the window blind strings, and knocks a portrait down. It insists on sleeping with Mitsuki on his bed until he relents. The next day, Kōtarō informs Konohamaru none of the men they apprehended had the stolen jewel, so they can't hold any of them. Kōtarō orders two other cops to keep an eye of them. Nezumi smirks as he walks free. At the Lightning Burger, Sarada informs Boruto and Mitsuki of the case developments, and asks Mitsuki about the kitten. Boruto informs them his mother and Himawari went to visit Hiashi, and won't be home for a few days. Boruto suggests Mitsuki to name the kitten. When Mitsuki intends to buy the kitten a hamburger, Sarada tells him he can't give pets human food. Mitsuki buys what he needs at a pet shop. Arriving home, Mitsuki looks for the kitten until finding it under his pillow. Thinking about Boruto's suggestion, Mitsuki names the kitten Mikazuki, and puts a yellow collar on its neck. Nezumi watches Mitsuki's apartment from the street. Over the next day, Mitsuki plays and bonds with Mikazuki. The following day, Mikazuki is ill, so Mitsuki goes around the village trying to find help. He misses his meeting with Boruto and Sarada, who go looking for him. Nezumi follows Mitsuki from a distance. At the hospital, Nezumi steals Mikazuki while Mitsuki is distracted getting directions to a veterinarian. Nezumi runs past Sarada and Boruto, who join Mitsuki in chasing him. Mitsuki catches up to Nezumi, who tries claiming it's his kitten. Boruto recognises Nezumi as one of the four men the police had to release. Mitsuki recovers Mikazuki and rushes to the vet. Nezumi tries to flee, but is blocked by the police, who figured out he had the kitten swallow the stolen jewel. They arrest Nezumi. The veterinarian, who is the same men who advised Mitsuki how to hold Mikazuki, informs him the kitten will be fine. At the park, Mikazuki's parent shows up, and the two leave together. Boruto and Sarada ask if Mitsuki is fine, but he says he doesn't feel anything, and that Mikazuki will be happier with its parent. Mikazuki visits him at night, so Mitsuki decides to keep his window open from now on so Mikazuki can keep visiting, pointing out its fickleness.\\n\"},\n",

On her way, she muses on why her father chose her name. While praying to her grandfather, Boruto, Shikadai, and Shikamaru pass by, Shikamaru having taken them to try a new burger. Shikamaru asks her if she's using Asuma's chakra blades, which she confirms, but adds she can't use them like Shikamaru does. Shikamaru points out she shares Asuma's chakra nature, so she shouldn't have difficulty mastering the blades. Mirai offers Shikamaru an answer to a quiz he made her, but it's a wrong one, and Shikamaru points out she's overthinking it. After the Nara leave, Mirai tells Boruto of her mission. Arriving at the gates, Mirai is disappointed by the casual and leisurely attitudes of Kakashi and Guy. They point out she's supposed to blend in as civilian. Mirai mistakes their casual conversation as an advanced form of blending in, and continues working herself up, even mistaking an old man on the road for a potential enemy. They arrive at their destination, and go on several shops. A pickpocket tries to steal Kakashi's wallet, but Kakashi immobilises him. The pickpocket throws the wallet to his partner, who Mirai chases and stops with her genjutsu. She hands the pickpockets over to the police. Mirai is upset for letting the pickpockets getting so close, and that Kakashi was so carefree. Kakashi points out the wallet he allowed to be stolen was a fake, and that there are other ways of dealing with problems than power. They arrive at a tree Kakashi considers to be hallowed ground, as it's where the movie adaptation of Icha Icha was filmed. Curious about their reaction, Mirai asks them what the books are about, but they refuse to say anything due to her age. They take a photo to remember the occasion. They talk about the vacation, and when Mirai asks about the mission, she learns there's no actual mission, much to her shock. At night in a hotel, Mirai watches from afar as Guy and Kakashi have dinner. Kakashi notices her, and invites her in. She insists on taking her mission seriously, even when he suggests her soaking in the hot springs, and he reveals her awkward attitude reminds him of Asuma.

She also stresses over learning the mission will actually be around twenty days instead of two, having misheard it.

Guy and Kakashi disagree on what she should focus on to overcome it. They comment on how she inherited her mother's traits and genjutsu. Arriving at the town, Guy finds it unusually populated, thinking it was a quieter town. Noticing the people wearing dog and cat masks, Kakashi recalls what the festival is about, and explains to Mirai the town's origins, and how different people celebrate different dog and cat deities, depending on which version of the town's origins they believe, and about a third destruction deity, neither cat nor dog. Cat lovers and dog lovers from various lands come to the festival, culminating in a shrine fight. While going through the crowd, they end up finding Kiba and Tamaki leading the dog lovers and cat lovers respectively. They came to the festival on a date and ended up taking sides. Mirai wonders if they should try to reconcile them, but Kakashi and Guy point out their matter is a private one. They figure that being able to stay in the town depends on making peace between the dog lovers and cat lovers, making the issue part of the mission. Mirai talks to Tamaki, trying to reconcile her and Kiba. She's upset because this was supposed to be a date, and spending time with him is difficult since he never gets days off in the Police Force. Mirai tries talking to Kiba, but he is too caught up with the dog lovers exalting his accomplishments to back down. Mirai tries to pass a peace-offering of her own as Kiba's, but ends up escalating the conflict. At night, the shrine fight begins. When Kakashi muses they might have to destroy everything before they consider talking, this gives Mirai an idea. She asks Guy for a lighter and uses its flame to fake an appearance of the destruction deity, presenting it as half dog and half cat. The devout worshippers promptly believe it, but Guy attacks the apparition and destroys a wall separating the dog and cat hot springs. The festival goers take it as a sign that Guy is a messenger of the destruction deity, telling them to stop being divided and celebrate as one. Kiba and Tamaki make up. Mirai gets to take her bath. Kakashi tells her that using the lighter for Fire Release is just like her father, explaining she used both her parents' jutsu to resolve the issue.

They hear Guy screaming, claiming he saw a ghost. Mirai gets Guy to sleep, and Tenten warns her to remember putting her clothes on before running out. Kakashi joins them, having returned from buying snacks. Kakashi asks about Guy, and they explain he claims to have seen a ghost, but they won't know more until he wakes up. Tenten believes Guy saw a ghost, but Mirai doesn't believe in ghosts, and swept the room. Kakashi says their snacks were gone, and thought Guy had eaten them, which is why he left to get more. Tenten takes it as proof it's a ghost, while Mirai wants to prove there isn't one. They ask the receptionist, who is shocked someone saw it. The receptionist tells them the story about the hot spring since war times, and how there used to be rumours of a ghost in armour that vanished after a mass exorcism was performed. They speak with several employees who tell them of strange occurrences the past few days. While discussing them, they lean over a statue, moving it a bit, and notice it has a stone base, while others have a wood base. Tenten suggests Mirai but through the stone with her chakra blade, but Mirai says she hasn't mastered them yet. Kakashi tells them Guy woke up, and Guy denies seeing a ghost. Kakashi accuses him of eating all the snacks, Guy denies it, challenges Kakashi to a ping-pong match, and the two leave. Mirai and Tenten discuss Guy's attitude. Guy and Kakashi return, asking Mirai to be their referee. Mirai thinks about the places the ghost supposedly appeared, and notices all of them face the inner garden. Guy continues to try avoiding places at their hot spring. Kakashi asks Mirai why she's so distracted, and why she's so determined to prove ghosts don't exist. She says that if they did, she thinks her father would have visited her. Mirai notices the ping-pong ball moving because of a breeze. She goes back to the statue, ready to find the so called ghost. Tenten scares Guy, and a girl appears from under statue after smoke starts coming out from under it. Mirai attacks with the chakra blades, and cuts the statue in half. They question the girl, called Tatsumi, who apologises. Mirai explains that she found secret passages from war times for evacuation, found evidence of recent human activity, had all of them but one blocked, and asked the employees to fumigate them, forcing whoever was inside to come out from the only unblocked exit. Tenten explains she was having too much fun watching Guy putting on a brave face. Tatsumi explains she was travelling and had no money, and chanced upon the secret passages. She begs them not to hand her over to the Land of Hot Water, as the trip she's making is for her deceased mother, visiting the hot springs she never got to see. Mirai offers to take Tatsumi with them and pay for her expenses. Kakashi warns her to be more careful with her chakra blades. They leave the next day, Guy finally explaining what he saw was an armoured warrior, which brings to mind what Mirai and Tenten learned about the place's history.

Chōji comments on potato chips all the way through their making, and makes a comment on advice Asuma used to give him, which sparks Mirai\\'s curiosity. She asks about her father, and Chōji tells her he smoked a lot and was quite vague, but that he understands Asuma more now that he has more years on him. He tells them about how Asuma gave his team their earrings. While their talking, the potato chips become ready. Chōji is unsure about their shape, but raves on their flavour when he tries them. Chōji grows in size to remove the boulder, and is joined by the other Konoha shinobi and the villagers. Chōji converts calories to chakra for a final push, removing the boulder. The hot spring begins flowing again. Chōji slims down from having converted so many calories into chakra. The old lady thanks Mirai, who downplays her contributions. Chōji explains how Asuma used to encourage him when he had trouble learning jutsu. When he mentions the \"king\", Chōji explains it was something Asuma asked them, and refuses to tell her the answer, as asked by Shikamaru. He says watching Mirai brought back memories of Asuma. Chōji leaves, and at night, Tatsumi and Mirai soak in the hot springs. Hearing Mirai talking about her father, Tatsumi confesses she\\'s been lying to them, and that she\\'s actually been looking for a hot spring where one supposedly can talk to the dead.\\n'},\n",

Tatsumi says she came all this way to see her mother, sceptical at first as well, but she had to try. She asks if Mirai doesn\\'t want to see her father. Mirai excuses herself. She thinks to herself she has a mission, but ends up changing her mind. She tells Tatsumi she\\'ll go with her, if only to protect her. Tatsumi is glad, and informs her they have to go, as they can only supposedly meet the dead at night. Mirai hopes to be back by morning. Walking through the village at night, they note how the atmosphere is different when it\\'s empty. On their way, they replenish their water on a spring. Mirai tastes iron in the water. Mirai asks Tatsumi what she wants to say to her mother, and Tatsumi explains she wants to apologise for a fight they had the day before she died. Mirai wants to ask her father who the \"king\" is. Mirai helps Tatsumi crossing difficult spots, impressing her with her shinobi skills. Someone spies on them. They arrive at a fork on the road, and the girl who spied on them approaches them, offering to take them to the hot spring, claiming to have been there herself and have met with her dead brother. She directs them to a cave behind a waterfall. As they approach the spring, Mirai smells sulphur. They meet several girls, some of whom have been waiting for a month, and they rejoice that there are now twenty of them, the number required for a ceremony. The attendants tell them they\\'ll begin soon, and lead them to a room where they meet Ryūki. Mirai asks him how he\\'ll let them see the dead, earning her reproach from other believers. He tells them of a shinobi who once used a jutsu to reincarnate the dead from the great wars, which Mirai recognises as Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. Ryūki claims the jutsu disgraced the dead and required a living sacrifice, but through his research, was able to learn a jutsu that wouldn\\'t have these consequences and requirements. Ryūki directs one of the women to the spring, having her name and the name of the one she wishes to see. The others hear her speaking through the steam. Tatsumi is next, and recognises her mother\\'s voice calling out to her. When Mirai gives her name and that of her father, Ryūki recognises her family name, and directs her to the steam. Ryūki has a Jashin symbol on his ring. Mirai seems a figure in the steam in her father\\'s shape.\\n'},\n",

Ryūki asks the women if they heard the voice of their loved ones calling out to them, and gives them water to purify themselves, instructing them not to drink until he tells them so. Mirai wants her father to teach her how to play shōgi, and expresses concern her father won\\'t recognise her. Ryūki claims to be able to move between worlds, and having met Asuma, who wants to meet her. Mirai makes a mention to a shōgi player her father supposedly admired, and who she\\'s supposed to be named after. Ryūki confirms Asuma telling him that, which Mirai takes as proof of his lies, as there\\'s no such shōgi player, and prepares to fight him. Ryūki orders the women to drink the water, but Mirai slightly shocks them with Lightning Release, which snaps them out of the effects of the hypnotic gases in the spring. Mirai concludes he\\'s the one behind the missing women, and he confirms they\\'re sacrifices so he can achieve immortality. Ryūki cuts Tatsumi\\'s cheek for some of her blood, and creates a link between her and a puppet, which puts her under his control. He orders Tatsumi to kill Mirai, and mocks Mirai for not fighting back against a non-shinobi opponent. Kakashi and Guy arrive at the spring, defeating other cultists as they do. Kakashi throws a kunai at Ryūki\\'s hand, causing him to drop the cursed puppet, breaking his hold over Tatsumi. Ryūki creates a diversion with the gases to escape, but Mirai follows him. She reaches a ritual room where Ryūki intends to exchange blood from human sacrifices for immortality. The room contains several spear throwing trap mechanisms. Mirai asks Ryūki who Hidan is to him. Ryūki considers Hidan a hero and wants to inherit his accomplishments, restoring the Way of Jashin. He considers the currently peaceful era to be a waste, which mirrors Mirai\\'s concerns that the challenges they face won\\'t allow them to surpass the previous generation. Ryūki seemingly slashes Mirai, acquiring her blood, and controlling her. Damaging the puppet, Ryūki appears to use her blood to acquire immortality, but everything fades as Mirai reveals her genjutsu. Ryūki is confused as he tasted her blood, but Mirai reveals it was just the iron-rich water from hot springs. Ryūki is convinced what he sees now is a genjutsu, and charges at her. Guy and Kakashi watch as Mirai strikes back at him, seeing Asuma in her as she defeats Ryūki. He and his cultists are apprehended, and Mirai explains what happened to Tatsumi. They talk about having memories of their loved ones and looking to the future. Kakashi and Guy exchange words and discuss Mirai\\'s growth. They part ways with Tatsumi and go back to Konohagakure. Mirai is sceptical that they came across such an operation by accident, and they explain their mission was to investigate the missing girls, while Mirai\\'s was to protect them, Kiba, Chōji, and Tenten having been sent to gather intel while acting as tourists. As they arrive, Mirai realises they\\'ve been giving her all the details so she can write the mission report. Boruto greets her as she arrives, and is shocked when she tells him what happened. Later, Mirai plays shōgi with Shikamaru, and says she figured out the \"king\" is the future generations.

Naruto and Shikamaru review the sections of the exams and those who passed them, discarding them as they analyse how they fought and strategised their battles. They eventually narrow it down to Sarada, Sumire, and Denki, and Naruto decides to promote Sarada, as while she's on par with Denki and Sumire in terms of strategy, he finds her to have the better fighting skills among them.

She claims the mission is easy, but Shikadai is suspicious of her coming all the way to his house to tell him if that was the case. Because the mission was sudden, they had to put together a team with the available genin. Shikadai meets with Iwabee and Wasabi at the gates, who begin arguing with each other. Boruto arrives late, and offers him condolences for his team. Their mission is to retrieve a flower that grows at the top of a mountain. The genin question the mission, and Shikadai explains it's a rare flower that blooms only once every four years, and due to its medicinal properties, is sold at high prices, so they should also be on the look out for bandits. Wasabi asks how they'll find the flower, and Shikadai presents them Tonsuke, a pig with a great sense of smell that'll act as their guide, much to their shock. Because he's the only pig who can find the flower, he's been spoiled rotten, and has to be fed special food regularly. Because one of the pigs who was being trained was stolen, they need to carry the pig as extra security, a task that falls to Iwabee. At night, they come across wolves. Wasabi scares them away, but also scares Tonsuke, who flees. Shikadai retrieves him, noticing his snout-shaped birth mark. Boruto attempts to reassure Shikadai while Iwabee and Wasabi argue over whether they should cross a bridge or go to a detour. Shikadai decides they should cross the bridge, but when Wasabi and Iwabee begin arguing again, the bridge starts swaying, and it scares Tonsuke, who almost falls, if not for Boruto and Shikadai. Shikadai forbids Iwabee and Wasabi from talking to each other for the rest of the mission. They come across bandits, and Iwabee and Wasabi both charge. Boruto warns Shikadai about a trap, but Shikadai injures his leg, and Tonsuke escapes. The bandits are defeated, and Boruto recovers Tonsuke. Shikadai decides to finish the mission by himself. Tonsuke suddenly starts eating forest mushrooms, much to Shikadai and Boruto's surprise. Shikadai notices the lack of the birth mark, and deduces the pig was switched with the stolen one during the skirmish with the bandits. They find the bandits, but can't give chase because of Shikadai's leg injury. Wasabi and Iwabee discuss Shikadai's decision, and Iwabee spots Shikadai's blood on the trap. Boruto attempts to make bridge with his shadow clones to cross a ravine, but the gap is too big. Shikadai wants to jump the ravine even with his injury, but Iwabee arrives and uses his Earth Release to make a bridge. He and Wasabi apologise for fighting. Boruto wonders how to find Tonsuke, and Shikadai says Tonsuke will signal them. As he hasn't been fed in a while, Tonsuke starts crying, allowing Wasabi to pinpoint him with her cat hearing. They're able to ambush most of the bandits with Boruto and his shadow clones. Shikadai lures Tonsuke with his food, allowing Iwabee to separate him from the bandit leader with Earth Release, and pins the bandit leader with his shadow. They find the flower and succeed on their mission. Back at Konoha, Moegi reveals the mission was also a test, to see with Shikadai was a capable leader, assigning him people other than his usual team-mates.

Sarada asks them about it, and they explain about its popularity. Boruto is bummed to get yet another repeat card of his father, and Sarada considers all three immature for being so into it. Chōchō calls her to try another new dessert, and Boruto considers them the same as well. While comparing new cards, the boys run into Shino, who gets uncomfortable learning Kiba and Akamaru are featured in the cards while he isn't. The three know how strong Shino is, and Boruto wants to make him a card, pointing out the Kaminarimon Company manufactures them. They manage to get an audience with Denki's father, who shows them a list of the next card series, which still has an open spot. Denki's father has such respect for shinobi he's having a hard time picking a final one. They advocate for Shino's inclusion, but Metal Lee ends up suggesting his own father, also not present in the list. Denki's father can't make up his mind, so Denki suggests they pick the one who'll make a bigger profit. The company will make a survey and let the customers decide who'll get the final spot. Boruto and Shikadai campaign for Shino with shadow clones and distributing leaflets, and Metal and Denki, who Rock Lee once trained, put advertisements on the trains. Checking on the current tally, Rock Lee is leading the votes, so to raise Shino's profile, Boruto has Iwabee make a Shino stone face near the Hokage Rock with his Earth Release in exchange for one of the super rare Seventh Hokage duplicate cards Boruto has. Metal uses taijutsu to try carving Shino's face into his father's. Boruto creates shadow clones to use Wind Release: Gale Palm to carve Shino's face back. Shikadai thinks it'll all end in trouble and leaves. Boruto and Metal end up carving the giant stone face into a small statue, and are stopped by Shino and Rock Lee. They say they don't want to stand out like that, but appreciate their effort. They notice a fire nearby and the genin worry they won't be able to rescue the person in it in time. Rock Lee kicks the statue into the building's water tank, and Shino uses his insects to remove the person from the fire. When the second series is released, Boruto calls Shikadai out for just abandoning their efforts. When they open their packs, there are both Rock Lee and Shino cards. Denki explains that their profiles were significantly raised by the fire rescue, increasing both of their demands, leading Denki's father to add an extra spot. However, they keep getting duplicates again. Sarada and Chōchō leave for a second round of new desserts.\\n\"},\n",

He tells Konohamaru about it, who think he should train more if he has time to watch movies. Boruto asks him if he watches movies like that, but Konohamaru denies it, saying that he can't lose focus with romance when he wants to be Hokage. They notice a young woman being pursued. Boruto and Konohamaru keep track of her as she loses her pursuers, and Konohamaru saves her from falling when she misses a step on stairs. The woman is astonished by the view while Konohamaru carries her jumping between buildings, and thanks him when they land. She introduces herself as Remon Yoimura. Boruto asks her why she was being chased. She claims she came to Konoha for sightseeing, ran into them when getting lost, and thinks she upset them. Remon insists on thanking them, so Boruto asks her to treat them lunch. At Lightning Burger, they try the latest item on the menu, a super sour Lemon Burger. Remon had never eaten a burger before, but loves sour foods. She enjoys it so much she decide to live in Konohagakure. At their suggestion, Konohamaru tries the burger, but doesn't like the sourness. Remon offers him a handkerchief to wipe his mouth, and he promises to wash it and return it to her. Boruto considers him uncool. They offer to show her around and guard her while sightseeing. When Remon shows interest in hair clips from a stand, Konohamaru offers to buy her one, and she has Konohamaru pick one. Boruto comments on the expensive hair accessory she's already wearing. When visiting the Hokage Rock, Konohamaru explains how he was named after the village and about his grandfather, and Remon comments on his verbal tick. They both act shy and blush. Remon trips on a rock and Konohamaru catches her. Boruto notices their awkwardness towards one another. By sundown, the men pursuing Remon find her again, but she tells Konohamaru and Boruto not to worry, revealing they're from her household, and were after her because she left without informing anyone.

Boruto asks Konohamaru about the situation, but he says nothing. On their way home, they find a girl from Remon's village who cannot remember her way home, so Konohamaru insists on taking her to the village. Kankitsu questions Remon about her attitude, telling her not to worry about the handkerchief, offering to buy her everything. Remon wants to retreat to her room, but Kankitsu has her confined to a new, secure building. Remon feels like a prisoner, but seeing how sad other villagers are about it, and Kankitsu reminding her it's for the good of the village, she relents. He also takes her hair-clip for safekeeping, and she protests, pointing they guard her memories from Sōma. Unable to get it back, Remon comments that he's changed. Konohamaru and Boruto return Anzu to her mother. Anzu says she couldn't remember where the village was, startling the villagers, which Konohamaru notices. Boruto argues they should visit Remon again. An old woman talks to Remon, saying how Kankitsu has changed, and informs her another villager lost her memory and got lost, but travellers brought her back. Remon is concerned, as the legend never mentioned anything like that, and concludes they must hurry the wedding. Konohamaru and Boruto notice the extra security around Remon's home. Konohamaru stresses that since this is a personal investigation, they must keep their involvement limited. Boruto points out he's the one who wants to talk to Remon. Remon thinks about her experiences in Konoha, and Konohamaru and Boruto arrive at her window. They're concerned for her situation, but she explains it's the only way to save her village. At Konohamaru's request, she tells the legend of her village. Four centuries prior, Daidai Village was almost destroyed by Sōma, a demon who consumes memories, leading them to waste away. She draws them a picture, a horned skull spirit. At the time, a shrine maiden, Kuen, battled Sōma, who came close to possessing her, but she managed to seal it in a rock. However, a portion of Sōma stayed within her, resulting in a curse that was passed down to her descendants. When bearers of the curse reach age twenty, the curse manifests a mark on their hands, signalling they connect Sōma with the outside world, and they slowly have their memories drained. Remon explains that she and Kankitsu are both descendants of Kuen through different branch families, and that every hundred years, the seal restricting Sōma weakens. Boruto notices Remon is not losing her memories, and she explains that her hairclip is a tool created by Kuen that protects against Sōma's power, given to the female descendants who inherit the curse. When Sōma gets stronger, its horns begin growing from the rock, signalling it is time for the seal to be repaired. At that time, a man and woman who bear the curse are wed and reapply the seal. Boruto questions why can't the seal be applied without them being married. Remon explains Kankitsu is losing his memories, and the only way to break the curse is through marriage. Boruto says they'll defeat Sōma, but she explains it doesn't have a physical form, so it can't be attacked with weapons or ninjutsu. Konohamaru confirms the existence of such beings, evidenced by the one his grandfather made a contract with. Kankitsu leaves at night, and the old woman wonders where he goes. Remon says Kankitsu wasn't this cold when they were younger, but Boruto is still against her marrying someone who will not make her happy. She explains that the story of Konohamaru's grandfather gave her strength to go through with it. He returns her handkerchief, then leaves. As Boruto argues against leaving Remon in this situation, they're approached by the old woman, Asaki of the Yoimura family. She confirms Kankitsu's change in personality, and asks them to confirm where he goes at night. He visits Remon, finds she has her handkerchief back, and stays put for the night. Kankitsu goes to see Asaki, who forgets what she wanted to do. Boruto notices she's late to get their report and Konohamaru becomes suspicious of Asaki's absence.\\n\"},\n",

Kankitsu informs him only people from the Daidai village are allowed on the site, and that he'll file a complaint about him with Konohagakure. His subordinates escort him out. Boruto spots Kankitsu when he returns, but also Asaki, and goes to talk to her. She doesn't recognise him, but spots Kankitsu with Remon's hair clip in the distance, and advises Boruto to leave. Asaki follows Kankitsu to the sealing rock, and Boruto follows her. She stops Kankitsu from destroying the hair clip, which ends up with Boruto. Asaki accuses Kankitsu of not being himself. Kankitsu surmises he has to do more than erase her memories, and moves in to finish her. Boruto forces his retreat with thrown kunai. He refuses to explain his intentions, adding Boruto would only forget them anyway, and produces several will-o'-the-wisps that follow Boruto around. Boruto dodges several of them, and Asaki blocks one with her own body. She grows antlers, which send two wisps back to Kankitsu, and passes out. Boruto blocks the next wisp, and while surprised by the hair clip protecting him, he's hit with another one from behind. Two wisps also leave his body through antlers. Boruto's memories of events since going to the movies are compromised. He flees the site with the hair clip, and continues to struggle with his memories. He falls into a river, and Kankitsu ceases the search. Due to Kankitsu's complaint, Konohamaru is placed under house arrest. Kankitsu informs Remon he's pushing up the wedding ritual, claiming Sōma is getting stronger. Remon asks about Asaki's absence. Kankitsu lies about it, and says he'll let her know if he sees her.

Kankitsu strikes to rock's binding ropes instead, to everyone's shock. Kankitsu grabs Remon's hand by force and continues the ritual. Konohamaru and Boruto arrive. Kankitsu proclaims he fulfilled his duty and passes out. Sōma manifests from the remains of the stone. It attacks Remon and Kankitsu, but Konohamaru pulls them out of the way.

Konohamaru attempts to fight Sōma, but it avoids him, and goes for Remon. Konohamaru gets in its way, and creating two shadow clones, attempts to seal it with one of his grandfather's seals. It merely restricts Sōma's movements for a while. They leave the cave. Kankitsu wakes up, now free of Sōma's influence, and recounts how he fell under its control. Boruto stresses that physical attacks and ninjutsu don't work against it, and Konohamaru points out it seemed to evade him. Remon says it only fears Kuen's hair clip, which Konohamaru has. Remon wants to seal Sōma inside her body, Kankitsu stressing the risks. They explain how Kuen did the same long ago, but lost all her memories as a consequence, being barely able to transfer it to the rock, and only managed to cut one of the manifested horns on herself. The hair clip can't protect one's memories when they have Sōma sealed inside. They hear Konohamaru's seal about to break, so he and Boruto go back in. Just as Sōma attacks them, Konohamaru summons a monkey, Enra. Konohamaru informs Enra of Sōma's abilities, and Enra transforms into a staff at his instruction. Dodging Sōma, Boruto covers the cave with several tags. Sōma attacks Konohamaru, who blocks his blasts with Enra. Konohamaru uses the staff to create a seal with the tags Boruto planted. A spectral monkey hand grabs Sōma, who struggles to break free. Enra comments Konohamaru doesn't have enough chakra, and the seal breaks. Enra's transformation and summoning dispel. Remon arrives with the hair clip, and seals Sōma inside herself. She struggles to keep it contained, and asks Konohamaru to cut the horns before losing her memories.

Using the freed hawk's commotion as a distraction, Boruto learns Sasuke's location. He comes across Sarada, who notices his enthusiasm, but he decides not to tell her about finding Sasuke's location. The next day, as a cover, he tells his mother he'll be camping with Team 7, and staying at Mitsuki's house. Boruto misses the train for the Land of Wind with Temari and Shikadai, but manages to sneak into a freight train headed there as well. Boruto makes it to the Land of Wind, but ends up dropping off one station early. He tries walking to the next station, but passes out from thirst and heat. He is rescued by Isago, and wakes up at her house the next day. She encourages to spend the night and go to the train station in the morning. Isago's father Gojō curtly tells him to leave. Isago explains her father dislikes ninja. He refuses Boruto's help with repairing garden, and reveals his village was destroyed in the Fourth Shinobi World War, not by enemies, but by shinobi on his own side in an attempt to smoke out enemies. He lives in isolation so Isago never has to go through the same thing. At night, Boruto and Isago play Shinobi Bout, and an alarm goes off. Their fence damaged again, Gojō explains he's being harassed by people who want him to leave the area to they can build a power plant that'll benefit many people. In the morning, Isago tries to make Boruto stay one more night, but he has to leave. He comes across the people harassing Isago and Gojō preparing to use a chemical to kill their greens. They hold Isago hostage to force Gojō to transfer land property, but still intend to kill their greens before harvest time. Boruto arrives and intimidates them into giving up with a Rasengan and a threat of informing Gaara of the situation. In gratitude, Gojō allows him to use a trolley he built to go to the train station. Boruto uses Wind Release to boost his speed, and arrives at the stone pillars marking his destination. He finds remains of Amaterasu burning and goes investigating. Nearby, Sasuke and Gaara fight Urashiki, who has a number of Toneri's puppets under his command. Boruto arrives, and Urashiki manages to snatch Sasuke's chakra while he's trying to protect Boruto. Sasuke charges at him, but Urashiki portals him away.\\n\"},\n",

Urashiki takes advantage of attacking an exhausted Gaara, but he is saved by Shinki and Shukaku. Shinki attacks Urashiki with his Iron Sand but Urashiki evades it with ease. Shukaku uses his Wind Release to try to push Urashiki away and grab him with his paws, but Urashiki evades him.

At first Shinki refuses because of Boruto\\'s immaturity and because Shukaku belongs to Sunagakure but relents when Boruto is the only one who knows Konohagakure\\'s terrain. Gaara states that Shinki can learn something from Boruto from what Boruto has that Shinki does not. Yodo and Araya will take Gaara back to Sunagakure to be healed.

Shinki takes charge in keeping Shukaku safe within his Iron Sand armour. As Kankurō, Shinki, and Boruto head out, they are sensed by enemy puppets.

Boruto is angry that Shinki is cold about Kankurō's well-being and Shinki is angry about Boruto not being able to prioritise the mission first before lives. Shukaku appears and tells Boruto how Shinki was similar to Gaara until Gaara was saved by Naruto who gave him a different path of instead of fight for hatred to fight to protect people and never give up on that.

Shinki begins fighting Urashiki's remaining puppet. It manages to hit Shinki with poisoned needles. Shinki feigns a hit from a sword with a clone, while the real Shinki anchors the puppet to the ground with Iron Sand and continues on his way, his arm paralysed. Shukaku teases him slightly that he might have been able to avenge his uncle if Boruto had been there to aid him in the fight. They arrive at a crevice, and Urashiki's puppet catches up to them, but so does Boruto, who lands a hit on it. Temari and Shikadai also arrive, giving Boruto and Shinki an opportunity to retreat. Boruto apologises for dismissing Shinki's feelings, but adds his friends are important as well. Shinki berates Boruto for being emotional, and Shukaku laughs, comparing Boruto to Naruto. Boruto goes back to help Temari and Shikadai, and Shukaku sneaks away from Shinki after Boruto as well. The puppet releases poison gas, but Temari blows it away, throwing the puppet into the crevice. Boruto arrives, and the puppet climbs back up. Shinki berates Shukaku for watching the battle, and Shukaku points out they do have to deal with pursuers. The three go against the puppet, and while Shinki thinks their fighting is inefficient because of their emotions, Shukaku points out they're able to coordinate just fine, and adds that while he did compare Boruto to Naruto, Shukaku considers Boruto smarter and more skilled than Naruto was. Shinki takes Shukaku and continues to move away from the battle. The puppet pressures the shinobi with multiple arms, chakra blasts, and attacking after burrowing itself under the sand. Temari unearths the puppet with her Wind Release, but it's able to dodge her attacks in the air, sending attacks of its own. Temari gets injured protecting Shikadai from an attack. Temari tells them she'll buy them time to leave, but they refuse. Boruto creates clones to form a perimeter and manages to land an explosive kunai on the puppet without detonating it, allowing Shikadai to uses Temari's fan to unearth the puppet again. In dodging Boruto's Rasengan, the puppet is caught by Shikadai's shadow, allowing Boruto to land his Rasengan, which along with the explosive kunai detonation is enough to destroy the puppet. Temari tells Boruto to catch up to Shinki, while she and Shikadai recover and look for Kankurō. Urashiki catches up to Temari and Shikadai, having watched them fight through the puppets, and steals both their chakra. He muses it'll be bad if Shukaku reaches Konoha, but he does want to enjoy himself. Boruto catches up to Shinki and Shukaku, updating them on the puppet's defeat.

Shinki is incredulous that Urashiki broke through Gaara's seal, and wonders how he tracked Shukaku when the kettle should suppress their chakra. Urashiki explains he watched them through the puppets, and reveals his Byakugan. He is pleased with taking Temari and Shikadai's chakra, which riles Boruto. Shinki stresses they have to keep a cool head, as neither Sasuke nor Gaara are there. Shukaku asks Shinki to unseal him, so he can fight. Shinki has a plan, and asks Boruto to buy him time. Urashiki attacks. Shinki blocks with his Iron Sand, and Boruto counterattacks with shadow clones. Boruto feints an attack disguised as a kunai, which Urashiki also avoids. Boruto signals to Shinki, who attempts to seal him with his puppet and Iron Sand. Urashiki is bored by yet another seal. They flee, and Shinki leaves several Third Eyes behind to keep track of Urashiki, certain that his seal won't hold as long as Gaara's. Boruto is concerned about the Byakugan, and Shinki changes their direction. Urashiki breaks free and resumes pursuit. Having put enough distance between them, Urashiki continues on the shortest route to the Land of Fire, unaware the genin and Shukaku have changed course. They can't rush to the Land of Fire, afraid they'll get in range of Urashiki's Byakugan, so Boruto suggests vising Gojō, who has a transmitter. Shinki struggles, having spent a lot of chakra with his Puppet Technique and Third Eyes. Boruto helps him. They arrive at Gojō's house, but it's been attacked. Isago tries to get her father from under the debris. Shinki is more concerned with knowing if Urashiki is the one who attacked them than with helping Gojō, earning Boruto's censure. Shinki rescues him. Gojō informs them who attacked them, confirming it was Urashiki looking for them. Their transmitter has been destroyed, so they can't ask for backup. Looking at a map, Shinki sees only one way to the Land of Fire, through a bridge, where Urashiki is sure to be on the lookout for them. Gojō says there's a longer path known only to locals, but Shinki is sure Urashiki will find it if he stays waiting long enough. Boruto suggests using both routes, one of them carrying a decoy kettle on the route Urashiki is watching, buying time for the other one to use the long route with Shukaku. As Boruto can do shadow clones for decoys, he think the logical decision is for him to be bait for Urashiki. At the bridge, Urashiki attacks Boruto, causing debris to fall into the river. At the longer route, Shinki notices the debris, and Shukaku talks to him about regret. In another dimension, Sasuke's chakra begins to replenish, enough for him to try getting back.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto attempts to hide from Urashiki to buy Shinki time, but Urashiki finds him with his Byakugan. Shinki arrives at the Land of Fire border, but is stopped by Mirai, who recognises him as Gaara's son. He doesn't attack, but stresses the urgency of his mission to speak with the Hokage. He can't share the details with anyone lower than chūnin, so Sai offers to hear him, having been sent to investigate Sasuke's lack of communication. Shinki informs him of the situation. Sai orders border patrol to be on high alert, Mirai and Shinki to stand by, while he takes Shukaku to Naruto. Urashiki attacks Boruto, destroying the clone disguised as Shinki. Using Shikadai's chakra, he pins Boruto with his shadow, and discovers the kettle with him is a decoy. Urashiki intends to use Boruto as a hostage and trade him for Shukaku. Boruto manages to land a superficial hit with a clone. Urashiki attempts to steal Boruto's chakra, but is blocked by Shinki's Iron Sand. Shinki tells Boruto he's guaranteed Shukaku's safety, and proceeds to attempt crushing Urashiki. Urashiki breaks free of the Iron Sand, switches to the Rinnegan, and attacks. Boruto sends a Lightning Release shuriken, which Urashiki blocks, but the charge goes through his fishing rod just the same. He evades their attacks by teleporting. Boruto's eye activates, which Urashiki recognises. He uses Temari's chakra as a distraction to attack Shinki, but Boruto's eye allows him to detect where Urashiki's portal will appear. Using clones as bait for Urashiki to destroy, they manage to corner him and land attacks, managing to break one of his horns. Urashiki strikes to kill, but his attack is blocked by Sasuke, who was able to track Urashiki through his constant use of Space-Time Ninjutsu through the fight. Sasuke attacks, but changing his eyes again, Urashiki disappears, but not through a portal, leaving behind crane origami of the same red energy that comprises his fishing rod and hook, which disappear shortly after. Sasuke is out of chakra, unable to pursue him, and Boruto and Shinki pass out from exhaustion. Gaara wakes up in a Sunagakure hospital, to Yodo and Araya's relief. Kankurō is battered up, but alive. A search party finds Temari and Shikadai, and informs them of Kankurō's status. Naruto is informed of the situation by Shukaku, wanting to leave immediately, but Sasuke arrives and stays his hand. Three days later, Naruto discusses the issue with Gaara, who wants to warn the other Kage. Shikadai informs Boruto that Shinki has been discharged, and Boruto rushes to the train station to say good bye. Shinki asks Gaara what he meant before, as he feels he has learned nothing from Boruto. Boruto arrives, and reprimands Shinki for not saying good bye to his friend.

Shukaku complains about their situation, and Naruto explains they'll stay with him. Shukaku only agrees because Gaara asked them, feeling uncomfortable with sharing a roof with Kurama. Kurama and Shukaku exchange insults. Naruto arrives home with Shukaku, explaining they'll stay with them until an official safehouse is picked. Boruto and Shukaku greet each other, and Himawari is instantly taken by how cute she finds Shukaku. Boruto asks Naruto and Shukaku about the tailed beasts. Naruto gives them a brief history of tailed beasts and jinchūriki. He later meets with the tailed beasts in their mental plane, though Matatabi, Kokuō, and Chōmei decided not to participate. They talk about their protection, and the others comment on Shukaku's absence in the meeting, which Kurama teasingly attributes to their current situation. While tucking Himawari in, Naruto and Kurama recall how she knocked them both out when she awakened her Byakugan. Shukaku overhears it and becomes intrigued. The next day, they all leave together, Shukaku eager to learn how she knocked Kurama out so they can tease Kurama about it. They spend the day together, and ultimate end up at the Senju park, where Naruto takes a nap. Shukaku sees nothing unusual about Himawari, so they ask her aside and questions her about it. She doesn't remember any of it, and Shukaku disregards her. Shukaku falls asleep, and their kettle is picked up, being mistaken for trash. Boruto and Himawari ask a park employee, who explains the trash was taken to a scrap yard. As they watch a trash compactor, Himawari blames herself for not watching Shukaku closely. The stress of the situation triggers her Byakugan, allowing her to find Shukaku's kettle. Shukaku awakes from the ruckus, and sees Himawari with the Byakugan. When it deactivates, she has no memory of it. Boruto breaks their fall. At night, Shukaku and Kurama actually bond over how the Uzumaki's drive them crazy, and are never boring. Shukaku figures Kurama actually likes them. The next day, Naruto takes Shukaku away, who waves Himawari and Boruto goodbye with their tail. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss the tailed beasts' safehouses, and Shikamaru muses at how Shukaku sleeps so carefree, and how he doesn't understand tailed beasts at all.

He asks about the tailed beasts the Hokage hid, but she defiantly says she wouldn't tell even if she knew. He takes her chakra, noting the potential usefulness of genjutsu. Someone tries to contact Mirai through her earpiece radio, which sparks Urashiki's curiosity and gives him an idea. Several shinobi patrol the streets in Konoha. Naruto feels this makes the villagers uneasy, but Shikamaru stresses they can't be too careful, as Urashiki has attacked many shinobi and can teleport. Naruto is concerned Sasuke isn't in top form since having his chakra stolen, and wishes Urashiki would come at him directly. Urashiki muses his actions have drawn too much attention, and decides to use all the chakra he gathered so far, hoping that getting Kurama will even it out. Shikamaru informs Naruto the other villages are cooperating, and that Mirai has gone missing. Naruto wants to send a clone to look for Urashiki, but Shikamaru and Sasuke counsel him against it. Boruto arrives, and asks why he was left out when all other genin were tasked with finding Urashiki. Naruto says it's too risky to send him out, as Urashiki has a vendetta against him, saying even he was more reasonable at that age. Sasuke suggests forming a two-man team with Boruto, as this should prevent Urashiki from easily going after Boruto, but Naruto restricts their movements to the village, as Sasuke needs to stay nearby in case Urashiki attacks Konoha. Boruto spots his friends, and Denki explains they're helping test new radio technology from the Kaminarimon Company. From Denki and Haguruma's mission control, they hear as Urashiki is found moving away from the village. Tenten relays orders through the radio. While several shinobi mobilise to corner Urashiki, Sasuke explains to Boruto that Urashiki is likely to have stolen Mirai's chakra, and using it to draw shinobi away from the village with genjutsu. The Konoha shinobi are able to prevent Kōrogi and Mirai from attacking each other, each seeing the other as Urashiki because of genjutsu. Urashiki had used Mirai's radio to gain intel on their movements, and prepares to go after Naruto. Boruto and Sasuke rush to the Hokage's office, but Boruto stops. Knowing that Naruto still has capable shinobi near him, he deduces Urashiki is after something else, and recalls that the artefact that has been on the news has the same symbol they saw in the Ōtsutsuki ruin where they fought the White Zetsu. They go to the research facility instead, and find shinobi drained of their chakra. Urashiki activates the artefact, Karasuki, a turtle-like device. Boruto and Sasuke arrive, and attempt to stop Urashiki from using it. Urashiki steps into the light created by the device, Boruto and Sasuke follow him into it, arriving at an unusual dimension. Boruto and Sasuke attack Urashiki, but he repels them, knocking Boruto into Karasuki, and causing them to fall off a ledge. Sasuke uses his Rinnegan to switch them with Urashiki, and shields them all with Susanoo. They land on a forest, and make their way back to Konoha.

Sasuke attacks, and Urashiki counterattacks, getting his hook into Sasuke. However, he's unable to get any chakra, having had a fūinjutsu applied to himself. Boruto and Jiraiya go to Naruto, Jiraiya cautioning Boruto against the leaking chakra. The chakra forms a Version 1 shroud around Naruto, causing him to rampage against them. Boruto tries talking to him, and briefly manages to calm Naruto down before the chakra causes him to attack. Jiraiya applies a sealing tag to suppress the Nine-Tails' chakra. Fighting Sasuke, Urashiki portals away to reformulate his strategy. While bandaging Boruto's injury, Jiraiya explains the prejudices Naruto faced from the villagers. Knowing Urashiki will be back, Jiraiya offers to train Boruto and Naruto together.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto says that he's on a secret mission, so he can't freely share his name and identity. Naruto decides to trust him. Jiraiya wants to train Naruto and Boruto to synchronise their chakra, having noticed their chakra are very similar, to the point it synchronised in their last battle. However, he doesn't know what kind of Cooperation Ninjutsu they'll end up developing. They try it, but fail, and Jiraiya explains that to do it properly, their chakra nature, power, and flow must be aligned. Since Jiraiya states their chakra nature is already similar, Boruto surmises they need to focus on power and flow, his observation earning praise from Jiraiya. They try it again, but the trauma of being attacked by Naruto when the Nine-Tails' chakra made him rampage hinders Boruto's performance. Jiraiya asks them what they visualise then trying to sync, and based on Boruto's answer, he confirms he knows the Rasengan, much to Naruto's surprise. Boruto realises that if they both try to sync visualising the Rasengan, the power and flow of their chakra will be better aligned. Jiraiya wants them to go back to Rasengan basics, and gives them a rubber ball to pop. They're unable to do it, but are in sync enough to expand it a bit. Jiraiya leaves them training to run an errand, how they'll do, and observes Sasuke keeping an eye on them from a distance. They keep at it, unable to pop the ball, Boruto's trauma still interfering, until Boruto runs out of chakra. Naruto realises Boruto's uneasiness when he recoils from his hand, and feels guilty. They take a break. Boruto stresses over not being able to talk to anyone, walks around and comes by the Hyūga estate, where he watches Hinata and Neji training. When he leaves, Neji approaches Boruto, having noticed him while he sparred with Hinata. He asks Neji why he and Hinata treat each other so formally and informally. Neji briefly explains their history, and notices something's on Boruto's mind. Boruto tells him about his situation with Naruto. Neji tells Boruto not to pity Naruto, and explains how he taught Neji one can determine another's fate. Boruto is encouraged by Neji's words. Jiraiya tasks Sasuke with bringing the boys something to eat. Sasuke talks to Naruto, and the two talk about their situations. Naruto is encouraged by Sasuke's words. At Konoha, Sakura bumps into Sasuke, who rushes away, but a paper drops from his clothes into a puddle, which she picks up and looks at.

Boruto goes back to Naruto, the two get over their awkwardness from before and resume training. Jiraiya is willing to stop investigating Sasuke's and Boruto's identities if Sasuke gives him intel on Urashiki. Sasuke agrees to it, and thanks Jiraiya for his fūinjutsu, which allowed them to counter Urashiki's chakra extraction. He informs Jiraiya of Urashiki's space-time ninjutsu, that he's able to sense it when Urashiki uses it, and that he might still have jutsu unknown to them. Sasuke asks how is Boruto and Naruto's training going, and Jiraiya says he doesn't know how it'll turn out, as they're also rather unknown to him. Naruto takes Boruto to have ramen at Ichiraku. Boruto asks Naruto about Sasuke. Naruto tells him of the Uchiha Clan Downfall and how Sasuke deserted to gain power from the pain of solitude, and went to Orochimaru, surprising Boruto. He tells Boruto he's training with Jiraiya to get stronger and bring Sasuke back, as he's someone he was finally able to bond with him. He doesn't know what it's like to have parents or siblings, but he figures that his bond with Sasuke is the closest thing he has to a brother. Sasuke tells Jiraiya that while his jutsu prevented Urashiki from stealing his chakra, he still hasn't replenished the chakra that was stolen during a previous fight, and that Urashiki could tell. Jiraiya wants to create an opportunity to seal Urashiki. Urashiki prepares to make his next move. While struggling with the training, Naruto thinks to apply the Leaf Concentration Practice, which improves their results. Sakura arrives and asks Boruto about the paper Sasuke dropped. The note got smudged from being dropped in a puddle, but a few words are still readable, including Sarada's name and Sasuke's name. Boruto is able to deflect her questions by saying it's probably someone else also named Sasuke. Sakura wants to ask Sasuke directly. Naruto and Boruto join Team Asuma for barbecue. Urashiki teleports in on Boruto and Naruto training. Sasuke senses him. Urashiki uses Sasuke's chakra to attack with Fire Release and Lightning Release. Jiraiya and Sasuke arrive, and Urashiki taunts Sasuke by attacking him with his own chakra. Jiraiya attempts a sneak attack, but Urashiki sees through it and impales Jiraiya with his rod.

Sasuke tries to buy them some time, and tells Boruto to run away with Naruto. Jiraiya summons a toad and flees, grabbing Naruto and Boruto. Sasuke grabs Urashiki, and jumps down a cliff into a river, still holding Urashiki. Naruto tends to Jiraiya's injury, while Boruto is tied to a tree, and wishes to go back and save Sasuke. Urashiki gets out of the river angry at Sasuke's interference, and grabbing his sword, decides to go after him. Sakura finds an unconscious Sasuke by the river and moves him. Jiraiya, Naruto, and Boruto discuss Urashiki's claim of being able to see the future. Boruto wants to go save Sasuke, but Jiraiya stresses they must figure out Urashiki's jutsu first. Boruto notices Jiraiya's stab wound and realises something. He wants to test out a theory. Urashiki finds Sakura and Sasuke's trail. Sakura tends to Sasuke, and when Urashiki arrives at their general vicinity, without having found them, tells her he'll spare her if she hands Sasuke over. Boruto and Naruto arrive. They attack with explosive tag kunai, and wired kunai to bind to a tree, but he just vanishes out of them. Urashiki counters Boruto's attack from a blindspot, and gets some of his blood on him. He attacks Jiraiya, who's hidden behind a tree. Jiraiya counters with a Fire Release. Urashiki flies above it. Jiraiya attacks with toad oil, Urashiki simply vanishing through the attacks. Jiraiya and Boruto notice the bloodstains on Urashiki drying as he does. Jiraiya creates an earth wall to allow them to escape. Urashiki pursues them. Boruto and Jiraiya discuss how the blood on Urashiki dried quicker than theirs. They consider the ways the blood could have dried faster, and Jiraiya concludes that Urashiki isn't seeing the future, but rather turning back time for himself, the extra time he experiences accounting for the quicker drying blood. Urashiki finds them with his Byakugan and attacks. He boasts how his jutsu allows him to experience the same moment many times and pick the best course of action. Jiraiya gets them all inside a toad's stomach, having deduced Urashiki can't turn back time more than a few seconds. Naruto and Boruto create shadow clones, many of which attack Urashiki, causing him to keep using his ability to avoid their attacks. Urashiki walks towards them, but suddenly coughs blood. Jiraiya reminds him they're in a toad’s stomach, in a highly acidic environment. While he kept turning back time, Urashiki exposed himself to the acid vapours for much longer, which took its toll on him. Jiraiya takes them out of the toad, and Boruto accelerates Naruto, who lands a Rasengan on Urashiki. Konohamaru, Udon, and Moegi watch from nearby. Sakura continues tending to Sasuke. Meanwhile, Urashiki stirs on the ground.\\n\"},\n",

Urashiki consumes his chakra gourd, and considering it not to be enough, eats his own Rinnegan. He manifests a new, golden Rinnegan on his forehead, and transforms, his eyes restored as golden Byakugan. Jiraiya is concerned by the feel of his chakra, and Urashiki claims he'll kill them. Team Ebisu decide to go back and notify the village. Urashiki lunges at the boys, requiring Jiraiya to pull them out of the way. Boruto and Naruto attempt to attack Urashiki, but he dodges them and counterattacks, throwing them at the ground. Jiraiya catches them, and decides to take the lead on the attack. Sasuke wakes up in Sakura's care. Jiraiya sends a Fire Release at Urashiki, who just eats it, leading Jiraiya to speculate he can't use space-time ninjutsu at the moment. He asks the boys to distract Urashiki while he comes up with a way to stop his movements. Jiraiya tries trapping him with his hair, but Urashiki breaks free, and tosses him aside by the hair. When Urashiki comes to the ground, Jiraiya tries sinking him in a swamp, but he breaks out of it as well. Konohamaru struggles to convince anyone that Naruto is in danger, until Shikamaru comes around. Team Asuma, Kiba, Akamaru, and Shino decide to go help Naruto. Sasuke tries to get Sakura to conserve her chakra. She warns him he's still not healed, and wants to ask him something, but passes out before she can do it. Urashiki pins Naruto down with a black receiver, and focuses his attacks on Jiraiya and Boruto. He taunts Naruto, wishing for the Nine-Tails' chakra to overflow. Urashiki attacks Boruto with no regard for his vessel status, but his attack is blocked by Sasuke, who also cuts Naruto free. Jiraiya lands a Rasengan on Urashiki, who finds it amusing. Sasuke sends a Fire Release that barely misses Urashiki. Urashiki attacks with energy blasts as it begins to rain. Sasuke gets in close and attempts to burn him with Amaterasu, but Urashiki dodges it. Sasuke applies it to his blade instead, which Urashiki counters with his black receiver. Naruto struggles to contain the Nine-Tails' chakra. Jiraiya blocks an attack meant for Naruto, causing him to go berserk. Urashiki celebrates the chakra coming out. Naruto creates Rasengan out of the chakra cloak and sends them at Urashiki. Jiraiya is concerned about Naruto dying, and explains to Boruto that the chakra, while powerful, also eats away at him. Boruto rushes to Naruto, Jiraiya figuring he's going for his Rasengan, and tells Sasuke they should save their strength for the right moment. Despite being attacked by Naruto, Boruto is able to reach him, and the two manage to combine their jutsu, their Cooperation Ninjutsu training paying off. While their jutsu clashes with Urashiki's, Jiraiya sneaks in a Rasengan of his own, distracting him, allowing Sasuke to hit him with Kirin, affecting long enough for the boys' jutsu to connect, defeating him. The Nine-Tails' chakra recedes, and both Naruto and Boruto collapse from exhaustion. Sasuke and Jiraiya comment on how difficult it is to have idiots for students.\\n\"},\n",

Sakura arrives and asks Sasuke about the blurred letter she recovered. Jiraiya lies and says they're fans of his books, the letter actually being a memo with information they gathered about him, and since he has connection to their group, the letter had Sasuke's name, and he knew Sakura's name. A mortified Sasuke goes along with the lie. Sakura leaves, and Naruto arrives, and is told of Boruto and Sasuke's imminent departure. The next day, Karasuki emerges from its shell, ready to work again. Boruto hides it when Naruto arrives to say goodbye. Naruto gives him a farewell gift, but tells him not to open it yet. Jiraiya talks to Sasuke, and wagers he and Naruto learned things they shouldn't, and confirms Sasuke can erase their memory. Sasuke erases their memory with his Sharingan, along with anyone they met in the past. Hinata and Neji find Naruto and Jiraiya passed out in the forest. While in transit back to the present, Karasuki explains it's able to go to another era again, having absorbed some of the Nine-Tails' chakra when it leaked to recharge. It takes Boruto's suggestion of doing something it wants as a command after they leave. Back in the present, Konohamaru finds them. Sasuke informs Naruto of Urashiki's defeat, and credits Boruto with determining Urashiki's real target, which allowed them to intervene.

Namida and Sarada are sad they won't be able to see her as often, as the new facility Sumire will be at is at the outskirts of the Land of Fire. Sarada wants to throw Sumire a farewell party, and plans to invite their Academy class mates. On their way to learn about their new team-mate from Hanabi, a girl appears on Namida and Wasabi's way, forcing Wasabi to change directions to avoid a collision, and the girl moves in a way that makes Wasabi fall. The girl is unimpressed by Konoha shinobi and leaves. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss the appointment of Sumire's replacement, a samurai from the Land of Iron, Mifune's last disciple, something Shikamaru says is unprecedented. Wasabi and Namida meet up with Hanabi, who chastises them for being late, and the girl they met earlier confirms her earlier opinion. Hanabi introduces her as Tsubaki Kurogane, their new team-mate, and asks them to show her around while she goes on a mission after Bingo Book criminals. Tsubaki rebukes Namida's attempts at conversation, and assures the two she's only there because she was ordered by her superiors, deeming there's nothing for her to learn in Konoha, and that she'll return home when her term is up. Wasabi wants to test Tsubaki's skill, and prepares to fight. Tsubaki takes position, but calls it off, saying that if she had drawn her blade, Wasabi would be dead. Wasabi thinks samurai are just talk, and Tsubaki thinks her higher-ups don't realise shinobi lack conviction. Sarada and Chōchō give the boys invitations for Sumire's farewell party, and inform them of her samurai replacement. The new Team 15 arrives, and readily antagonises the others. At the end of the day, Tsubaki thanks Wasabi for showing her around, which she felt proves her assessment of shinobi's lack of conviction. At night, Wasabi and Namida discuss their situation, before spotting one of the criminals from Hanabi's mission. Tsubaki thinks back to when she was told to go to the Land of Fire, and spots Namida and Wasabi tailing the criminal. The criminal spots Wasabi and Namida, and is joined by his two comrades. The girls and the criminals fight. When the criminals get the upper hand, Tsubaki arrives, and concedes that Wasabi standing up for Namida improved her opinion of shinobi a bit. She defeats the criminals. When Hanabi arrives, she scolds Namida and Wasabi for getting involved without clearance. Sumire introduces herself to Tsubaki and thanks her for protecting her friends. Tsubaki admits there's a lot she doesn't know and wishes to learn. The next day, Sumire's farewell party takes place, with all her Academy friends giving her gifts and words of encouragement.

By Hanabi's request, Hinata invites her family, and suggests that Hiashi will be happy to get surprise gifts from Boruto and Himawari. Having no idea what to get him, Boruto asks Sarada and Mitsuki for advice. They have no idea, and Boruto enlists Mitsuki to help him. They try sneaking into the Hyūga compound, but are caught by Hanabi, who confesses she also has no idea what her father would like. Gatai from Kumogakure arrives and issues a challenge to Hiashi, based on renown and claim of strength. Boruto and Mitsuki hide from Hiashi, who has Hanabi say he's away. Gatai doesn't believe her, and concludes Hiashi must be weak. Hanabi explains Hiashi always turns away such challengers, which further confuses Boruto. Hanabi reports back to Hiashi, who clarifies his claim of Hyūga strength isn't about force, something he wishes he had realised sooner, as he looks to a photo of himself, Hinata, Hizashi, and Neji. Boruto discusses Hiashi with Mitsuki, noting that while he dotes on his grandchildren, everyone else mentions how strict he was in the past. Mitsuki asks if something happened that triggered a change in him. Gatai and his attendant arrive at the Lightning Burger, boasting of having Hiashi scared of facing him. Fed up with his bad-mouthing of Hiashi, Boruto challenges Gatai. Boruto easily evades Gatai's attacks, and enrages him when saying he wouldn't even be a match for Hanabi. Gatai's attacks cause damage to their surroundings, and when Boruto decides to use the Rasengan, Hiashi stops their battle, having heard the name Hyūga was invoked in a duel. Blaming his own lack of foresight for Boruto's action, he accepts Gatai's challenge. Gatai backs down and leaves. Boruto is impressed with Hiashi's power, but Hiashi stresses that using power and fear to settle things breeds tragedy and enmity. Boruto doesn't understand why Hiashi allows himself to be mistaken for weak, and can't stand others making fun of him. Hiashi admits he has no standing to lecture Boruto, and that he lived a very different life until he learned better, but refuses to elaborate and leaves. Mirai arrives, having heard shinobi were fighting, and Boruto says it was just a misunderstanding. Learning that Mirai's mother Kurenai used to be Hinata's team captain, Mitsuki suggests asking her for insight on Hiashi. Mirai takes them to her mother, who has an idea of what Boruto wants to know, but is unsure if she should speak of internal family matters. Mirai and Mitsuki excuse themselves, and Kurenai tells Boruto of the Hyūga Affair and how it shaped Hiashi. Mitsuki asks if Boruto knows what to gift him, and Kurenai points out that his past is why he cherishes time with his grandchildren so much. On his birthday, Himawari gives Hiashi a scarf, and much to Hiashi's surprise, Boruto wants to take a family photo, to have as a record that they're happy. Hiashi is overcome with emotion. At night, after Hinata and the children are asleep, Hiashi asks Naruto if he gave Boruto the idea while he makes them tea. Naruto says it was all Boruto. Hiashi thanks Naruto for changing Neji, him, and the Hyūga. The next day, Mitsuki and Sarada ask Boruto what he got for Hiashi. Hiashi appears at the Uzumaki home, wanting to spend time with Boruto, much to his embarrassment.\\n\"},\n",

Team 40 discusses their situation with Team 7, who point out her clan's possession summoning never went out of control when they were in the Academy. Because Enko's rampage sent their sensei to the hospital, they're assigned Ibiki Morino as their new team leader. Team 40 is intimidated by his reputation. Ibiki wants to disband Team 40, and use Enko's abilities in interrogations, as he considers Dōshu and Tsuru incapable of getting over their fear of her, and says no one overcomes their fears. They think Ibiki's reliance on tranquillisers to subdue Enko when she goes out control isn't good for her. Ibiki leaves with Enko, and tells Dōshu and Tsuru they'll be transferred to new teams. Later, Dōshu and Tsuru discuss Enko's willingness to go with Ibiki. Team 7 offers to help them in any way they can. Going through a psychology book, Sarada suggests they turn their fear into interest, and try making it fun. They watch a scary movie, but Sarada is the only one scared during it. The next suggestion, by Mitsuki, is about getting used to the fear until their bodies feel safe in the situation. Team 7 takes them to the zoo, where they got permission to get close to the giant-maned wolf. Dōshu and Tsuru give it a try, without much success. Boruto spent the day bothered by Ibiki's claim that no one overcomes their fear. Tsuru and Dōshu try picking up a stray cat, but it gets scared of them and runs. Ibiki tells Enko that her former team leader informed him that her thoughts and feelings are what's triggering her episodes. Enko says she first decided to wear gloves to obscure her affected arms after a friend saw her clan's jutsu was passed down to her and got scared of her, and that it worked for a while, until her team-mates saw it. His mention of them being assigned to new teams triggers her jutsu, and she destroys Ibiki's blowgun before he can tranquillise her, and decides to leave the village. While Ibiki mobilises shinobi to go after her, wanting to seal her arms, and cut them off if necessary, he orders Dōshu and Tsuru to stay behind. They follow him anyway until they find her, and he explains that what triggers Enko to go out of control isn't fear, it's loneliness. Ibiki shields them from Enko's attacks. Dōshu and Tsuru apologise for making Enko feel lonely, and she manages to regain control. Tsuru asks Ibiki if he understood Enko because he also feels lonely over being perceived as scary. He doesn't give a conclusive answer. Team 40 finishes their lost pet mission, working together without issue. The lost pet takes a liking to Ibiki.\\n\"},\n",

He apologises profusely, but the generic nature of his apology angers her more. Inojin leaves Sai's body, and Ino chastises him for bring their son into the fight. Inojin tries going into Ino again, he admits hasn't mastered it, messing it up halfway, and tells her how he heard she once saved Sai with the jutsu, which is why he wants to master it, so he can protect others. While they talk, Chōchō gives Sai advice on what to do to end their fighting. Chōchō tells Inojin to leave, and he sees his father hugging his mother. Ino comes to and is embarrassed by the hug, and changes to subject to praising Inojin's jutsu. At the end of the day, Inojin promises to treat Chōchō burger and fries. The next day, Chōchō and Inojin tell Team 7 of Inojin's training, and Inojin treats Chōchō.

Boruto and Mitsuki think back to being assigned a mission to infiltrate the prison, and collect information on who the leader of the Mujina Bandits is from a former member before the bandits can have him killed inside. Boruto and Mitsuki were sent because arrangements to have Kokuri protected inside would take too long, as Kusagakure, who administers the prison, hasn't been targeted by the Mujina's crimes, so they don't feel obligated to prioritise obtaining that information.

The doctor says access to the medical ward is restricted, requiring a special wooden tag to get in. Boruto suggests a doctor lost theirs. A prison guard takes Boruto back to his cell, and Boruto reassures Kokuri he'll protect him. Back in his cell, Boruto updates Mitsuki on what happened, and decide to have Kokuri transferred to their cell so they can watch him at all times. Mitsuki sends Sarada a snake with a message, requesting Mujō to place Kokuri in their cell when he's discharged. Despite being in charge, Mujō's request is denied by Benga, who claims the empty spot on their cell is for the next prisoner coming in, and is steadfast about following protocol in that prisoners are returned to their original cells. He stresses the danger of making such a precedent. Mujō can't force the issue, and takes pills to cope with pain. Sarada comes out of hiding after Benga leaves, and Mujō apologises for being unable to help. Benga complains to a guard that Mujō is just a figurehead of the clan, and that he's the one who actually runs the prison. Sarada leaves Boruto and Mitsuki a note explaining Benga's interference with prison management, and investigates Benga's office. Haie delivers Benga a message from Tsukiyo demanding to see him. Tsukiyo bribes him to deal with Kokuri. Sarada narrowly avoids Benga and leaves his office. Prisoners are allowed outside for exercise time. Boruto and Mitsuki ask around for information on Benga. Mitsuki tries talking to Kedama, who he determines to be protecting the flowers. The prisoners watch and cheer on a fight. Arai agrees to help Boruto, and reveals prisoner Doragu might know something. Doragu is interested when Boruto says he wants payback on Benga, but can't give away something for nothing, and proposes a test of willpower. The light from the prison's lighthouse hinders his sleep, so he asks Boruto to get its light bulb. Mitsuki discreetly reminds Boruto not to use ninjutsu, as that would blow their cover. The prisoners bet on whether Boruto will be successful, and only Kamata bets on his success, albeit by accident. Boruto avoids guards, traps, and lightning strikes, and gets to the light bulb, but it triggers an alarm. Doragu knew it would, and declares Boruto will be in prison for life now. Boruto manages to get away by using Lightning Release to charge the light bulb, the resulting flash hiding his escape, and tells Doragu to hold his end of the deal. Kemata asks a guard to take care of his earnings and to mail something for him. Mujō confronts Benga over a handbook detailing his bribe deals with the prisoners, and reverses his previous decision, putting Kokuri in Boruto and Mitsuki's cell. One of the doctors reports his wooden tag is missing, which triggers a lock-down and a full prison sweep. Mitsuki determines that the only opportunity a prisoner would have had to steal one was when Boruto was taken to the medical ward, and as all prisoners were locked in their cells, Kokuri's assailant has to be one of their cell mates.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"The prison goes into lock-down. Boruto asks his cell-mates to check on their belongings, and he and Mitsuki explain what they deduced about who stole the medical tag and attacked Kokuri. Kamata is suspicious of Boruto's claim not to be Tsukiyo's accomplice, but Arai believes him. Benga announces they'll begin searching for the medical tag, and that if found, the everyone in the culprit's cell will have their sentences extended and be sent to solitary if they can't determine who in the cell is the culprit. Sarada wants to question Tsukiyo, and Mujō wants to assign a guard to accompany her. When Boruto discusses the attack on Kokuri with his cell-mates, Kamata finds the assailant to be stupid, and says he wouldn't have messed it up. Kamata tries to get Kokuri to say why Tsukiyo wants him dead, but Arai warns him that Kamata is conniving, and will use any valuable information he learns, and also calls his bluff when he prepares to fight. Arai also discreetly warns Boruto about Kedama, not to be deceived by the appearance he doesn't care about anything. Arai voluntarily shows his bunk, and when Kamata refuses to let them search his, Arai points out he frequently talks to guard Haie, suggesting that's how he's in touch with Tsukiyo. Kamata instead mentions how he saw Arai making his way to the medical ward the day before, and accuses him. He claims he went to the cafeteria, to see the smuggler, and shows the chocolate he got as proof. The lock-down sweep continues. Sarada interviews Tsukiyo, who sees through her and asks why she's pretending to be a reporter. Kamata still refuses to let them search his bunk, and Kokuri goes through Kedama's by mistake. When Kedama says he didn't agree to it, Mitsuki finds the medical tag in his sheets, to Kedama's surprise. Arai calls Kedama a coward, and reveals he used to be respected by all the prisoners, but in reality he spied on them on behalf of the guards, and told on a friend who tried to escape. While Mitsuki and Boruto are willing to hear him out, Arai is adamant not to trust him. When Arai mentions the Mujina Gang, Mitsuki points out none of them had mentioned the Mujina. They accuse him of having hidden the tag in his sheets when he volunteered to show his bunk, and slipping it to Kedama's bunk when everyone else was distracted. Arai pushes Boruto aside trying to get to Kokuri, but is punched by Kedama and immobilised by Mitsuki. They hand him and the medical tag over to Benga, ending the lock-down. Benga reports to Mujō and asks about Boruto and Kokuri. Mujō tells him not to suspect prisoners for no good reason, as not to incite retaliation. Though Arai was caught, Boruto and Mitsuki still don't know much about Kokuri, or his intel about the Mujina.\\n\"},\n",

Benga is suspicious of the group. Benga visits Tsukiyo, who tries to get him to transfer Kokuri to another Hōzuki Castle where Tsukiyo's underlings can kill him. Benga tries getting information on Boruto and Kokuri from Kamata, pressuring about his sick sister and the money he won from Doragu, and offering him hamburgers. He reveals he got the hamburgers with Kamata's earnings, and has the letter he wrote he sister, where he claims to have saved a boy from a rogue ninja in the Land of Lightning. He threatens to reveal her his crimes, and offers to let him see her after her surgery if he can find out what Boruto and Kokuri are up to. Mitsuki sees Kedama looking over the ruined flowerbed, and Kedama claims not to remember why he looked after them. Boruto has Sarada put Kokuri under genjutsu, making him see Tsukiyo beating Boruto and asking him about the money. Kokuri reveals he donated it all. Kamata overhears it. Mitsuki confirms it, seeing in the news that the Medical Foundation recently received a mysterious donation. Kokuri explains he used to be an accountant, and regularly moved money around on behalf of the company's clients. One day, he learned it was the Mujina's money, putting it together from various newspapers reporting their robberies, and ran away in desperation, not noticing he still held the Mujina's latest earnings. He donated it, but was later spotted by Mujina members, who chased him until he jumped down a waterfall and sway away. Determined to atone, he tried to stop a men from pickpocketing a woman, but it turned out the woman was the pickpocket, and he was charged as her accomplice. Kamata overhears everything, and is conflicted, having learned Kokuri's donation helped his sick sister. Shikamaru and Sai report to Naruto that Kusagakure informed them Kokuri is to be paroled, so they have to inform Team 7 and coordinate with Mujō. Kamata lies to Benga about there being nothing between Boruto and Kokuri, but Benga knows his tells, and beats him up. He has Haie send Kamata to solitary and extend his sentence. Mujō informs Benga of Kokuri's parole, and has him suspended for arbitrarily extending prisoners' sentences. Mujō's condition acts up, and Benga keeps him from taking his medicine. He burns up Kokuri's parole order, takes control of the prison, and informs Tsukiyo he'll have Kokuri transferred. At night, Boruto notices Kamata's absence, and everyone is notified that Benga is in charge. Benga informs Kokuri of his upcoming transfer.

They use the opportunity to go over escape plans with Sarada. Mitsuki has used his snakes to discover an escape route, and Boruto has learned from Doragu the upcoming schedule of food supply ships. However, they still have to remove the Heavenly Prison jutsu from Kokuri. Based on Sarada's research, Mitsuki had to tamper with the above ground drinking water tank, which they can't get Kokuri next to, so the prison employs its spare underground tank, which takes in and filters seawater. The tank is new, but the older, unused underground water tank is still in place, and should have minimal security on it. Sarada intends to tamper with the valves so it will be filled up as well. They arrange a signal to let them know when they can move Kokuri. Kedama spots one of Mitsuki's lookout snakes, but assures them he's only there for the bird droppings. Concerned about Kedama's history of snitching, Mitsuki follows him, and binds him with snakes, surprising him by being able to use ninjutsu. Mitsuki can tell Kedama is hiding something, and sympathises with him, recalling his own time infiltrating enemies. Kedama reveals how his plan to escape with his friend Kiku resulted in his death. Benga discovered Kiku, and instead of allowing their deaths making them martyrs to inspire other prisoners to keep defying the staff, he lied and said Kedama reported the escape attempt, turning the inmates against him. Kedama didn't deny it because he felt guilty over being late to escape with Kiku, and assures Mitsuki he won't tell anyone. Doragu, who in reality answers to Benga, reports that Boruto has asked about the food supply ships, and that Sarada has asked Tsukiyo about his relationship with Benga. Benga has guards look for Sarada, who creates a distraction to turn the tank valve. Benga intercepts Sarada underground, and when she tries to force him to leave her alone by implying her knowledge of his abuse of power, he attacks her with Fire Release. She dodges it, but his attacks hit a gas line, and the explosion causes the floor to collapse, and Sarada falls through. Kedama overhears Benga calling off the search for Sarada, and his command to stay away from the gas leak in the underground, but makes no mention of it to Boruto and Mitsuki. Despite the lack of signal, Boruto trusts that Sarada managed to carry out her part of the plan, so their escape is still on schedule.\\n\"},\n",

As they near the tank, Kokuri is concerned by Sarada's lack of communication, but Boruto is confident she'll pull through. Sarada is unconscious, and the water level at her location is rising. Benga goes through Sarada's belongings, and finds evidence of her working with Boruto, Mitsuki, and Kokuri. Benga goes to Boruto's cell, where he destroys Boruto's shadow clone with a fire punch. He orders the guards to find them, with orders not to engage them and notify him. The prisoners are riled up by an escape attempt. Benga fails to have Kedama inform on the fugitives. After he leaves, Kedama discovers a hole dug up by Mitsuki. Boruto tells the others his shadow clone was discovered. Sarada wakes up, and is surprised by the presence of seawater underground, before moving to join the others, and notices the rising water level. Benga discovers Sarada's notes on using the old water tank. Benga sends a summoning after the fugitives. The two-headed, fire-breathing hound attacks them. Mitsuki uses Lightning Release to collapse the ceiling on it. They arrive at the water tank just in time for it to finish emptying. They need to keep moving to avoid Benga's hound. Sarada is saved from the rising water by Kedama, who explains the location was part of his failed break out plan involving the spring tide, and that Benga is aware of theirs. He directs her to the tank, and she moves on ahead to join the others. Boruto and the others find barrier tags, which they discover to trigger the Heavenly Prison. The hound catches up to them, and so does Benga, who explains the hound is passed down by wardens to hunt down fugitives. The hound dodges Mitsuki's Lightning Release, and knocks him down when he tries to restrain it. Kokuri attempts to flee, but triggers the Heavenly Prison. Sarada arrives, and punches a hole in the ground, allowing the spring tide to remove Kokuri's Heavenly Prison and wash away Benga and his hound. Kedama walks around, and comes across Doragu. He tells Doragu he's free to snitch to Benga, and Doragu notices Kedama's Heavenly Prison is undone. Benga prevents Haie from asking reinforcements from Kusagakure. He tries to claim his reward from Tsukiyo, but he can tell Benga is lying. He has Benga remove his Heavenly Prison by promising to take care of Kokuri's accomplices, and kills Benga.

Tsukiyo explains that under a full moon, his jutsu can manifest the most of its power, and manifests shadow versions of the genin, which can also use their jutsu. Since the shadows are evenly matched, they attempt to attack Tsukiyo himself, but the shadows intercept the genin. Kokuri despairs. Prison guards discover Benga's body. As they fight, the genin realise that their shadows are also using their chakra for using jutsu. Kokuri hands Boruto a notebook with every information on the Mujina Gang he has, in case Tsukiyo kills him. The guards turn on the searchlights, looking for escapees. Kokuri notices the shadows avoid having their connection with the genin under the searchlights. Tsukiyo uses his lightning to take down the men operating the searchlights. Kokuri protects Boruto from his shadow's attack. Sarada punches the ground, the dust giving them cover. Prison guards find Tsukiyo, who attacks them with the genin's shadows. Kokuri informs the genin of what he has discerned about Tsukiyo's jutsu. The genin attack their shadows and Tsukiyo, creating a smokescreen and a distraction, giving Kokuri time to get to a searchlight, which dissipates the shadows. Tsukiyo procures a sword out of his own shadow, which doesn't fade under the searchlight. Mitsuki and Sarada accelerate Boruto at Tsukiyo, who is thrown out of the cliff side. Tsukiyo pulls Kokuri down from a rock halfway down where he landed, but the rock breaks, and both of them fall down to the ocean. Mitsuki stops Boruto from going after them, noting the strong currents. Kokuri manages to get back, reminding them of his swimming aptitude, claiming Tsukiyo ran out of strength and drowned. Prison guards arrive with Konoha shinobi, including Sai, who explains that Naruto got concerned after they lost contact with Mujō, so he contacted and coordinated with Kusagakure. Sai also informs them that while bold, their escape attempt was unnecessary, as Kokuri's sentence had been unlawfully extended. Boruto passes Kokuri's intel on to Sai. They depart Hōzuki Castle, once again under Mujō's authority. At the Konoha Police, Kokuri corroborates his intel on the Mujina Bandits, including their boss and his jutsu, and later leaves under a new identity. He arrives at a Mujina Bandits hideout, where he reveals himself as their leader Shojoji, who had taken Tsukiyo's identity to go after Kokuri, and then Kokuri while the two where under the water.

Boruto thinks back to talking to Sasuke about his new seal and the conversation with Momoshiki when time stopped, which Sasuke was able to perceive due to his Rinnegan. Sasuke told Boruto that what's happening isn't normal, and that he should be on his guard, and let him know if anything changed, while he investigated it on his own. The news reports on the robbery of Konoha Bank. One of the robbers, from the Mujina Bandits, is suddenly apprehended by Mitsuki with his extended arm. Sarada lands a hit on another, and exchanges a few blows before defeating him. She is not impressed with them, though the third bandit says she is nothing compared to their boss. The third bandit attacks her, Sarada blocks his attack, but he extends a poisoned blade, which Sarada struggles to hold back. The bandit says he'll take her corpse to his boss. Boruto arrives and lands a kick on him, finding it unusual for her to be struggling. Out-numbered, the bandit runs away, hiding with a smoke bomb. Sarada notes the plan is working, as they can now track him to his boss. However, because he wasn't listening to the plan, Boruto doesn't let him get away, and defeats him with a Rasengan, much to Sarada's chagrin. Sarada berates him for not following the plan. Boruto wants to leave to meet with Shikadai. Despite the plan not working, Konohamaru still considers it a successful outcome. Ibiki reports to Naruto that Katasuke was being influenced by someone outside the village, and is in great shock over the realisation of his actions after being freed from control. Under that control, Katasuke also leaked information about the Kote. Naruto has Ibiki and Sai continue investigating, while Shikamaru deals with Katasuke. Mirai arrives, reporting that Team Konohamaru apprehended all three Mujina Bandits in the village. They notice their boss, Shojoji, from their Bingo Book, wasn't present. Shikamaru reminds Naruto of his meeting with the Land of Fire's daimyō, which he forgot about. On the way to Konoha, the daimyō's son Tentō shows him a young Naruto trading card he got.

Tentō judges Boruto's clothes, expecting the Hokage's son have more lavish clothing. Konohamaru tells Boruto that for the next few days, he'll be Tentō's bodyguard, while the daimyō is at a conference in Konoha. Boruto, having taken an immediate dislike to Tentō, doesn't want to take up the mission. However, Konohamaru informs him that the Daimyō himself asked for him. More privately, he also tells Boruto this is part of learning about what shinobi have to put up with. When Tentō starts ordering him around, Boruto tells Konohamaru he really wants to beat him up.

Unmoved, Tentō shows him his card collection, which stuns Boruto, as he has the super rare card Boruto is after. Tentō offers him the card in exchange for teaching him ninjutsu. Boruto initially refuses, but Tentō continues to annoy him, so he agrees, intent on using harsh training to change Tentō's attitude.

His captors claim to be the Mujina Bandits, they threaten to kill Tentō if Ikkyū lets the information go public, and their demands include 500 million ryō and the release of all the prisoners from Hōzuki Castle.

They comment on how it's been difficult to schedule the class with the recent group being involved in so many incidents, and they hope they class uncovers someone with an aptitude to medical ninjutsu. Sarada worries about taking the class, since she didn't have any aptitude for it when it was taught at the Academy. Sarada overhears Shikadai and Inojin talking about how perfect the Hokage is, unaware they're talking about trading cards, and feels compelled to excel as she intends to be Hokage. The next day, she attends the class with Hako, Wasabi, Inojin, Dōshu, and Iwabee. They all either assume her aptitude, or count on her to help them if they struggle. Sarada perks up when Sakura explains they'll begin with a lecture followed by a written exam, as she's better at those than in practical application. In the first practical part of the class, Sakura has them mix coffee and milk, and then separate them again with delicate chakra control. Dōshu and Wasabi end up spilling the mixture, and Sarada panics as she only mixes it up more. Iwabee manages the separate the mixture, but the effort makes him thirsty, so he drinks a bit of Sarada's mix by accident, switching their glasses when she has her eyes closed focusing. Sarada is confused to see her mixture separated when she opens her eyes. Next, they practice the Mystical Palm Technique on special dummies. Sarada has trouble doing it, and knocks her dummy off the table when Boruto surprises her from outside the window. It helps her use the jutsu. Boruto, Shikadai, and Mitsuki are caught, and explain that having finished their assignments, thought to come by and observe. The next exercise is about applying chakra to a flower bud, to make it bloom, simulating an injured comrade. Wasabi and Inojin end up snapping and dropping their flower stems. Dōshu's struggle to make his flower bloom works, but it knocks it aside to Sarada's side, causing others to believe she succeeded. Shizune arrives for the final assignment, noting they haven't held the class in a long while, and brought Naruto and Shikamaru as guests. Sarada is encouraged to show her skills to Naruto, healing a fish dummy. Her nerves end up causing her to burn the fish instead of healing it. Sarada finally confesses she's no good at medical ninjutsu, and has no idea how she succeeded in the previous tasks. She confirms she felt pressured to perform well because she's Sakura's daughter. Naruto admits he can't use medical ninjutsu, and Boruto lists other things he has trouble doing. The class continues, and Inojin is able to perform the healing, so Sarada asks him for tips. Sakura is called to deal with an emergency, and Shizune reveals to Sarada that Sakura didn't pick up medical ninjutsu quickly, and had to go through a lot of training with Tsunade. At night, Sarada asks her mother why she became a medical ninja, and Sakura explains she wanted to become strong and walk beside Naruto and Sasuke, assuring Sarada she can also learn if she applies herself.\\n\"},\n",

They can't agree on a course of action, so Tsubaki acts on her own, defeating most of them, but her actions allow their leader to escape, requiring Team 5 to continue the chase. Later, her team-mates ask her why she didn't use her full power, allowing Team 5 to take credit for the mission. She claims her Secret Sword: Snowstorm Beheading hasn't been working well lately. When the two teams meet up again, there is tension between them. Denki tries to defuse the situation, and shows them their compiled statistics on his computer, pointing out Tsubaki's are beyond a typical genin's. However, when tracking their stats as a team, Team 15's performance has dropped since Tsubaki joined. Tsubaki takes upon herself to make her team beat Team 5's scores, by competing within the team itself during missions. Having performed ahead of her team-mates in their next mission, Tsubaki is treated to a mountain of fries. Hanabi notices her team's increased competitiveness through their next missions. When guarding a merchant, they get so focused on catching the bandits after them they leave him unprotected, requiring Hanabi to save him from other bandits of the group. Hanabi informs them that due to their failure, they won't participate on their next schedule mission with Team 5. Tsubaki writes to her mother. While eating fries at the Lightning Burger, she is approached by Boruto, who is concerned by her only eating fries, and explains the strength of the place is the meal deal. He encourages to try other foods to appreciate how good each of them are. She is taken aback by how each food elevates the other. Tsubaki finds Wasabi and Namida training by the edge of the forest, and they hear groans coming from it. They find the hunter from the mission they'd have shared with Team 5 tied up. The hunter explains he was attacked on the way to Konohagakure, and Team 15 informs the police. The man impersonating the hunter for Team 5 is the brother of the bandit they caught in their mission with Team 15. They attack Team 5, but Team 15 arrives to help them, informing them reinforcements are on the way. During the fight, Tsubaki notices how each member of Team 5 covers one another's weak points while bringing out their strengths, which she likens to how the food combos Boruto showed her. Some of the bandits retreat, so Denki asks Team 15 to give chase. More bandits corner Team 15, and Tsubaki understand they must improve their team-work. Tsubaki asks Wasabi for a smokescreen, which allows her to get in the middle of the bandits for her kenjutsu. It takes much of her energy, so Namida has to hit the retreating bandit leader with her Calling on Tears Technique, allowing Wasabi to capture him. Tsubaki passes out from chakra exhaustion.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Walking around Konohagakure, Himawari passes through several businesses, including Ino's and Tenten's shops. Hinata, Hanabi, and Boruto discuss Himawari's career path. Hanabi thinks Himawari will become a shinobi like other Hyūga, but Hinata and Boruto think the decision rests with Himawari. Hanabi offers her a pamphlet, showing that the Academy is holding a one-day trial, in case Himawari wants to get a feel of what being a shinobi is like. Himawari thinks it might be fun, and accepts. The lesson is overseen by Iruka and Shino. During introductions, the other students are surprised that Himawari is the Hokage's daughter. Their first lesson is an obstacle course, where Ehō and Himawari do the best. Next, Shino demonstrates walking on vertical surfaces, and though none of the students are able to do it, Himawari is almost able to do it, impressing everyone. They move on to target practice with shurikenjutsu. Yuina is impressed by Himawari's performance, who explains she sometimes trains with her brother. Ehō wants to be Himawari's rival, and is surprised that she still doesn't know if she wants to be a shinobi. He feels self-conscious about being out-performed by someone who isn't sure they'll be a shinobi, and becomes stand-offish with Himawari. Anko takes the students to a simple mission. Iruka and Shino discuss the possibility of Himawari joining the Academy. Iruka, as principal, bemoans the fact that he doesn't get to interact with students during classes, so Shino invites him to observe with him. The students' mission is to find a lost cat at Senju Park. They're given flares to signal if they think the mission is impossible to continue, at which point adults will intervene, though that also means they fail the mission. Though the park is vast, Yuina finds tracks. Iruka and Shino observe them. Noticing Himawari's hesitation, Ehō tells her leave if she doesn't want to take part in it, and throws a rock in frustration. The rock knocks a hornet hive, and the hornets chase them. Himawari considers using the flare, but Ehō doesn't let her. They manage to get away from the hornets, and he splits from Himawari, taking Yuina with him. Iruka and Shino approach her, and tell her it's okay for her not to know if she wants to be a shinobi, which motivates her to carry on. Ehō and Yuina manage to find the cat, but end up falling into a well. Himawari uses her Byakugan to look for them. Though she finds them, Ehō refuses to let her help him. He prepares to use his flare, so Himawari jumps down the well to stop him, and motivates him not to give up. The three of them lean on each other to climb out of the well. Ehō apologises for his behaviour towards Himawari, and tries to get her to hit him as punishment. The teachers watch from a distance, satisfied with the result. At home, Himawari tells her brother and mother she wants to learn more about all kinds of jobs and insists Boruto to help her out.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"On a rainy day, Mitsuki finds Mikazuki, who leads him to an injured and bleeding man. The man asks if Mikazuki is his before passing out. The man wakes up in Mitsuki's apartment, having been given first aid. He thanks them both and introduces himself as Samidare. He finds it strange that Mitsuki didn't ask why he was bleeding in an alley. Mitsuki says he doesn't care either way, unless Samidare wants him to ask about it. The following day, Samidare's injury is healed, and Mitsuki asks if he has to go somewhere. Samidare explains he's come to visit his little sister, who works at a big company in Konoha. Mitsuki compares his pride in his sister to Boruto's in Himawari. However, Samidare says he's not a good big brother. Samidare wants to thank Mikazuki, and buys him a new collar with a bell. Mitsuki notes he has a way with cats, and Samidare says his sister, also named Mikazuki, had one. Samidare leaves as Boruto and Sarada approach Mitsuki, telling him they've been summoned for a security mission. Kōtarō wants them to protect the president of the Kaneki Corporation, a chemicals corporation on par with the Kaminarimon Company. He is the likely next target of the Rain Killer, a serial killer who always kills his victims with a thin, sharp tool on a rainy day. All of the victims so far have connections to an accident on a Kaneki chemical plant years prior. At Kaneki's residence, he surprises Kōtarō by claiming he remembers nothing of the incident, and refuses the security details, believing his own bodyguards will suffice should the need arise. Kōtarō has Team 7 guard him secretly from a distance. It begins to rain. They spot someone approaching, but Kaneki's bodyguards fall over before even being attacked. The intruder makes his way to Kaneki. He tries leaving with Kaneki, but Boruto and Sarada engage him. Mitsuki recovers Kaneki, and pursues the Rain Killer. Mitsuki attempts to attack him with snakes, but they're killed from a distance. The killer escapes by jumping into a river. Mitsuki meets Samidare the following day, and asks if he was able to meet his sister. He says he did, but she yelled at him. Mitsuki notices he's a shinobi, and he claims he used to be, having quit after being an obedient dog for years. Mitsuki asks him about his past as a shinobi, and Samidare evades the questions. He says he quit because he wasn't there for his family when they needed the most, and now it's too late. Kōtarō and Team 7 review what they know about the case. Mitsuki notices something in the records of the chemical plant accident. Policemen inform them that Kaneki has been kidnapped, even though it's not raining. Kaneki wakes up with the killer at Mikazuki Amaashi's grave. She was the developer of the project that resulted in the accident, because Kaneki pushed it forward to keep ahead of the competition. She died and lost her reputation, while Kaneki just got wealthy. Mitsuki exposes the killer as Samidare, and wonders if he's killing those who ruined her sister's reputation. Samidare says he only wanted the truth at first, knowing Mikazuki wouldn't have gone ahead with a dangerous project. However, they just made excuses and disparaged the dead, so Samidare killed them. He asks Mitsuki not to interfere, but as a Konoha shinobi, he has to. Mitsuki believes Samidare to be in a dilemma, as he knew Mitsuki was a shinobi, having seen his forehead protector, but mentioned his sister's name anyway, something that could lead to someone stopping his revenge. Samidare says he has no problem with his resolve. It begins raining. Samidare uses his Water Release, which Mitsuki blocks, and counterattacks with Lightning Release. Mitsuki explains how he deduced how Samidare's jutsu worked. Samidare tries killing himself with his jutsu. The next day, the investigation on the plant accident is reopened, and Mitsuki visits a comatose Samidare in the hospital, putting the collar he bought for Mikazuki on his wrist.\\n\"},\n",

He also notes that between her failing to go full power and her return to a fuller figure, she's not fully releasing her power. Chōji wonders about her motivation when she uses the jutsu. He and Chōchō go treat themselves, and are approached by Anko, who reminds Chōji that he's supposed to meet with Shikamaru. He leaves, and Anko joins Chōchō and they order more sweet bean foods. The shop owner says they've run out of sweet beans, and they haven't been able to resupply because of bandits stealing their deliveries. Bad harvests have increased the demands, so bandits are stealing beans to sell them at a higher price. Other shops are in similar situations. They're supposed to get a delivery the following day, so Anko and Chōchō decide to safeguard it. The delivery is attacked, and Anko stresses they must be careful not to damage the beans. Chōchō's attack damages the road, causing the cart with the beans to fall, which triggers Chōchō's protection instinct, so she successfully uses the Butterfly Mode. Some of the bandits are amazed by Chōchō's jutsu. Anko gets trapped by debris from the road, and Chōchō is unable to get into Butterfly Mode to get through the debris. Anko tells her to use the beans and spare ingredients in the cart to make bean paste to restore calories for her jutsu. The smell of the cooking beans leads the bandits to their location. Chōchō avoids them and eats the bean paste she cooked to recover calories. Thinking back to her father's words, Chōchō realises she wants to protect Anko and the beans, and uses the Butterfly Mode to defeat the bandits and free Anko.

The building used to be a sewage treatment facility, until it was abandoned due to a toxic gas incident that caused several fatalities. They also hand them a map of the waterways. Sai congratulates them on their intelligence work, and requests them to notify the nearby Anbu teams that he and Sasuke will continue alone. Sai notices that rebuilding hasn't progressed in Amegakure. They venture inside the building, and are watched by someone. Sai and Sasuke trigger a trap, exposing the one watching them and subduing him. The man accuses them of killing his friends. Sai tells the man they're Konoha shinobi, and Sasuke asks to hear the man's story, as the ones who killed their friends might be the same ones they're looking for. The man introduces himself as Garashi Tōno. He explains he learned ninjutsu from an old man who raised orphans like him who lost their families during wars. Garashi isn't sure when Sai asks about Kara, but recognises the name, and shows them a design he copied from them. They investigated them when Kara showed up, glimpsing something like an experiment, but they were spotted, and all but him perished to poisoned gas. Parts of the building collapsed behind him, but Garashi is sure that there are still places with the gas. Garashi asks why it took the Land of Fire so long to act if this is something in their interest. Sasuke asks Garashi to take them to Kara's hideout. Garashi asks them to help him recover his friends' remains in return. At the hideout, Garashi warns them not to wander in side paths, and that depending on the airflow, the places with poison gas changes. They arrive at a blocked passage, which Sasuke breaks open with Chidori. Garashi rushes in. Sasuke and Sai follow him, and when they find Garashi on the floor, they're caught in a trap as gas begins filling the room. The real Garashi appears with a gas mask, and reveals he killed his friends with the gas because no one would save them, but Kara offered him hope. Garashi leaves them to pass out, and considers releasing more poison to deal with their allies. Sasuke and Sai show up, the ones Garashi trapped being clones. Sai explains he was careful avoiding dangerous areas along the way, but rushed in near the end, and though getting close to his friends would make him emotional, Sasuke noticed a strange calm to him. Garashi tries escaping, but begins to suffer the effects of the poison gas. Even if Kara wants him to die, he refuses to let Konoha learn anything, and kills himself. The building begins to collapse, so Sai draws a bird for them to escape. They spot some of what remained from experiments, but can't investigate. They conclude that not only they confirmed that Kara actually exists, but also that they have sympathisers. Back in Konoha, they report to Naruto and Shikamaru. Sasuke adds that Kara's experiments are likely biological, as he's seen similar equipment when he was with Orochimaru. Sai asks if Naruto saw Ino's report on Katasuke. She was able to determine a third party had been influencing him. Naruto wants to reinstate him, as testing without him has slowed down considerably, something they can't afford when their work has been leaked.

He's heard that Shojoji's intel led to confirmation of the organisation's existence, and wants to go find out more about them, concerned about the seal in his hand. Sasuke warns him that seeking an enemy without enough understanding about them leads to death, and directs him to keep training to carry out his assigned missions. He concedes he can't really talk, since he left the village very young, and hands Boruto a glove to hide his seal, which draws attention.

Konohamaru recalls Yūga's words, and compares the creature to the Shinigami and Sōma. They evaluate what they know about the creature. Boruto considers attacking the creature again, as Konohamaru's Rasengan damaged it before, but Mugino wants to destroy the barrier, reminding them their mission is to retrieve Hashirama's cells. Mugino accuses Konohamaru of spoiling his genin. Konohamaru understands Mugino, but assures him the genin are dependable. Mitsuki is warned by his snake that the creature is coming their way, having absorbed chakra from the wildlife inside the barrier. They move close to the barrier, Konohamaru and Mugino attempt to break it, while the genin guard them. Despite accepting his decision, Boruto is disappointed that Mugino trusts them so little. Mitsuki warns them the creature is closing in. Using clones and snakes, Boruto and Mitsuki hold the creature in place, allowing Sarada to hit it. The attacks cracks a jewel in the creature, but otherwise appears to not have done significant damage. The creature notices cracks on the barrier, and ignores the genin, rushing to the edge of the barrier. It attacks Konohamaru and Mugino. Mitsuki arrives and distracts the creature with his snakes. Seeing the situation has changed, Mugino wants Boruto and Konohamaru to prepare their Rasengan, and asks Sarada to back him up. Mugino holds the creature up, allowing Boruto and Konohamaru to strike it. They destroy its jewel, defeating the creature and breaking the barrier. Mugino collapses, having had a lot of his chakra drained. Mugino criticises Boruto for not thinking ahead, and Boruto criticises his communication skills, which Konohamaru supports.

As Deepa also resumes his pursuit, Omoi passes out trying to reach his team-mates. Asaka and Hiruga discuss their past, their brothers, and their debt to the Land of Haze for taking them in as orphans. Asaka notices the Konoha shinobi approaching, so they prepare for it. The Konoha shinobi strike first, but only hit clones, which obscure their sight upon destruction. They dodge explosive tag kunai, stepping on tar-like sludge on the ground. Hiruga appears, already activating another jutsu. The sludge restricts their movement, stopping them from forming hand seals. Asaka leaves with the Hashirama Cell. Everything in the range of the sludge begins to sink into it. Sarada notices that the closer things are to Hiruga, the faster they sink, and Mitsuki determines Hiruga will also perish. They question his willingness to sacrifice his life, but he retorts he's saving one. Hiruga thinks back about his brothers, and how Yoruga sacrificed his life so they could infiltrate Fushū Castle. Boruto questions the orders the quadruplets received, but Hiruga tells them how they were taken in, calling Boruto out for not knowing what it's like to starve, having lived in a great nation. Mugino determines that as Hiruga is the one sinking the fastest, if he dies, the jutsu will give out. They realise Hiruga is just buying time for Asaka to cross into the Land of Haze. Hiruga's jutsu begins to break, and Boruto tries saving him. Hiruga and Boruto both accuse the other of making assumptions about them. Omoi arrives, and informs them all of Deepa killing his subordinates, and they realise he will intersect with Asaka. Boruto convinces Hiruga to check on Asaka himself, so he releases the jutsu. Hiruga rushes to Asaka, with the Konoha shinobi right behind him. Omoi stays behind after warning Mugino and Konohamaru of Deepa's abilities.

Boruto tries to reassure Hiruga, but he says he won't join forces with them, only wishing to warn his brother. The Konoha shinobi fall back to let Hiruga warn Asaka. Asaka attacks Hiruga, believing Hiruga to have died fighting and the person in front of him someone transformed into Hiruga. Boruto interferes, allowing Hiruga to confirm his identity. Hiruga calls a temporary truce with the Konoha shinobi until they defeat the third party. Hiruga and Asaka are suddenly attacked. Deepa announces his presence and blocks Boruto's kunai. They notice it didn't leave a scratch, and Deepa mentions how he manipulates carbon to make himself so impervious. Konohamaru attempts a Fire Release, to no avail. The genin put themselves between Deepa and the Haze shinobi. Deepa refuses to say why he wants the Hashirama Cell, saying it would take too long to explain. Victor appears, talking down to Deepa. He asks for them to return the cells, but they refuse. Victor rushes near them and creates a twister, separating the jōnin from the group. Victor goes deal with them and tells Deepa to deal with the genin. Deepa attacks them with carbon cubes. Victor fights Mugino, who holds in place for Konohamaru's attack from above. Victor manifests two extra arms to weave hand seals and calls down lightning. Konohamaru asks Mugino to act as support since he can't fight with his injury.

Deepa implies he will eat the genin. Boruto wants to land another Rasengan at Deepa. Mitsuki lands a surprise Lightning Release, which does nothing. He attacks with snakes while Sarada analysis Deepa's movements with her Sharingan for an opening. She manages to dodge and deflect his cubes and moves out of the way at last time as she runs out of chakra, revealing Boruto right behind her. Deepa feigns pain from Boruto's attack for a moment and laughs at his attempt. Deepa carbons up his finger and flicks Boruto aside. Deepa prepares to crush Boruto with his foot, but Asaka draws his attention with the Hashirama Cell and sets off an explosion with his kinjutsu. Deepa has no scratch on him, but is irritated that the Hashirama Cell was in danger. Boruto passes out, and Deepa punches down with his armoured fist. He hits nothing, Mitsuki having saved Boruto with his Sage Mode. Mitsuki attacks Deepa with senjutsu lightning, and flees carrying the unconscious Boruto and Sarada. The attacks merely pushes Deepa back a bit, and he shifts his focus to the Hashirama Cell still with him. Mugino rescues Konohamaru from being strangled by Victor. An explosion from the fight between Deepa and the genin draws their attention, and Victor decides to check why Deepa is taking so long. Konohamaru and Mugino are too injured and tired to chase him.

Some time later, Konohamaru and Mugino arrive back at Konoha, carrying Boruto and Sarada, who could only get first aid at Yubina's. They're handed over to Sakura, who treats them with Shizune's help. Hinata and Himawari are concerned about Boruto, but Naruto assures them he'll be ok as Sakura is treating him. Konohamaru blames himself for their injuries as he was part of the mission. He confirms he left Mitsuki under Orochimaru's care, as his situation was beyond Yubina's ability to help. Log notices Orochimaru's concern for Mitsuki, who claims to be concerned for Mitsuki as a sample. Konohamaru, Sai, Shikamaru, Sasuke, and Naruto confer, and review what they know about Victor and Deepa. Konohamaru wants to investigate Victor's company, but the Land of Valleys is an independent nation, so they can't force the issue. Shikamaru has a contact with influence in the country, but it will take three days for arrangements to be made. Victor handles the Hashirama Cell with care, concerned they might never have another chance if they mishandle this one. Deepa mentions a previous plan that didn't work, which led them to their current situation. Deepa and Victor argue about their roles in Kara. Victor dispatches Deepa to retrieve another item. Boruto wakes up and Shizune tells him what happened. He asks for Mitsuki, and she explains he's with Orochimaru. Sakura examines Sarada, and is grateful for Yubina's work on her. Boruto and Sarada wait for tests, and brood over how their jutsu were useless against Deepa. Shizune shares her concerns about Boruto and Sarada with Sakura. Team 5 visits Boruto and Team 15 visits Sarada. Shikamaru manages to get permission for Konohamaru to observe Victor's company. An old lady who owns a pet shop foretells the death of a close friend to Mugino. Teams 5 and 15 discuss Boruto and Sarada, finding their cheerful attitude forced, and grow concerned about them.

Konohamaru wants to leave without telling Boruto and Sarada, but they arrive. The jōnin believe they want to join them, but instead they just want to inform them they want to train to get stronger. Boruto wanted to train with Sasuke, but Sarada is already training with him. He doesn't want to ask his father, who is working hard on Kara intel, so Sasuke directs him to Kakashi, as he's the only other person in the village who can use the Rasengan.\\n\"},\n",

He promises not to complain during training, but Kakashi considers it impossible for Boruto to use the Big Ball Rasengan, as he doesn't have the Nine-Tails to account for the chakra necessary for that jutsu. Boruto insists that Kakashi helps him train, and demonstrates his Rasengan. Boruto isn't satisfied with the damage it inflicts on rocks, and is impressed by Kakashi's. He is determined not to lose like he did to Deepa again. Kakashi compares Boruto's attitude to Naruto's, and agrees to oversee his training. He checks with Boruto to see how much he knows about nature transformation. He explains that jutsu are made stronger by combining nature transformation and shape transformation, and that the Rasengan uses only shape transformation. Kakashi has Boruto demonstrate his Vanishing Rasengan, and explains to Boruto that it employs lightning chakra. He considers it an incomplete jutsu, and suggests for Boruto to try using wind nature chakra. Boruto's Rasengan behaves erratically at first, so Boruto focuses on increasing his control over it. Sarada asks Sasuke to teach her the Chidori. Sasuke explains that using Chidori makes one vulnerable to counterattacks, and demonstrates by countering Sarada. He adds that with only one tomoe, her Sharingan doesn't give her enough perception to read her opponent's moves, the Chidori requiring at least two tomoe Sharingan to be used. Sarada wants to train to awaken more tomoe, but Sasuke reveals that it doesn't work like that, only heightened emotions from extreme situations can awaken more tomoe. Sasuke proposes helping Sarada master her one tomoe Sharingan first. Knowing what Sarada struggled with during her last mission, he has her dodge a barrage of projectiles. She fails, but isn't disheartened by it, and asks to keep going. Konohamaru and Mugino investigate Victor's company, but are only shown more legitimate labs. Discussion gets more aggressive when they ask about the Hashirama Cell, but Konoha can't force the issue without escalating it into a diplomatic incident. Himawari misses her brother during dinner, and Hinata explains Boruto's determination for getting stronger. When Boruto asks for advice on his training, Kakashi refuses it, but instead tells him what Naruto learned when training wind nature transformation. Boruto feels frustrated, blaming himself for Mitsuki's injury, and envying how strong Kakashi was at his age. Kakashi points out the hardships he had to endure, and envies Boruto for growing up in an era of peace. He hands Boruto a lunchbox Himawari dropped for him, telling him he's not alone, which gives Boruto an idea. Sarada fails to dodge another barrage, and Sasuke tells her not to focus on all targets, and instead focus on the area of the attacks. Sarada also thinks back to Mitsuki's injury, and asks for another barrage. Boruto manages to add wind nature to his Rasengan with the aid of a shadow clone, and passes out from exhaustion. Sakura watches Sarada training. Victor's secretary reports having escorted Konohamaru and Mugino to the border, but in reality they have infiltrated the company to find the truth about Victor.\\n\"},\n",

The only area they have yet to search is the underground area accessed through the elevator. Shikadai greets Boruto, and tells him not to overdo it with his training. Boruto shares Kakashi's conclusions with him. Chōchō observes Sarada's training with Sasuke. Team 10 is assigned a mission by request of the Land of Wind, to recover the missing puppet Urashiki used against them. The fact they haven't been able to recover it concerns them that someone else may have acquired it. They discuss Boruto's and Sarada's training. Deepa eats a meal at the Land of Wind. Chōchō wants to eat at a place her father told her about, and they reach it just as Deepa departs. They find the place trashed and everyone inside dead. The next day, they meet up with Team Shinki, and inform them of the restaurant incident. They arrive at the general area where Shikadai defeated the puppet, and they have Araya quickly canvas the area with his Sanshōuo puppet. Araya finds the puppet. Deepa arrives at the scene, and Shikadai warns Team Shinki that he was present in the restaurant incident. From Deepa's words, Shikadai deduces he's the one who defeated Team 7. Deepa attacks with his cubes, and Shinki blocks with his Iron Sand Wall. Deepa manages to break through, hitting Araya and Yodo. Chōchō and Inojin make separate attacks from two different directions, allowing Shikadai to pin Deepa with his shadow. Shinki attacks him, but his Black Iron Fist has no effect. Deepa breaks through Shikadai's shadow, and shatters Shinki's Iron Sand Wall with a single cube. Deepa collects the puppet and turns to leave, noticing his hand steaming.

He figures Boruto is training to fight Deepa, and threatens to stop him by force if necessary to prevent him from being so reckless. Shikadai thinks Boruto wants to get stronger because he hates Deepa, but Boruto denies it, and explains that fighting Deepa made him realise how inexperienced and lacking in power he is. Shikadai offers to help him train. Hinata arrives to give Boruto a lunchbox, and considers making an extra one for Shikadai. Sarada continues practising with Sasuke, now dodging kunai. She almost dodges them all, and Sasuke notices her problem is endurance, as she couldn't keep her Sharingan active during all of it. He congratulates her on improving her perception. During a break, Sasuke asks her how her eyes are taking the strain. Sarada says they're fine, and having researched about it and not found much, she asks him about the Mangekyō Sharingan. She asks if he thinks she can awaken it, but Sasuke postpones the conversation. Sakura arrives, and Sarada tells her of her progress. Sakura is concerned with the strain she's putting on herself, and Sasuke assures her he's making sure Sarada doesn't overdo it. Sakura gets agitated when Sarada mentions wanting to develop her Sharingan like Sasuke's. Sarada feels frustrated, believing her mother is being overprotective, and leaves. Sakura and Sasuke discuss Sarada and her Sharingan getting stronger. Hinata overhears their conversation. Shikadai has Inojin and Chōchō help him with Boruto's training. Shikadai believes that with the nature transformation Boruto is capable of, he can't sustain it for long, and thinking back to his battle with Deepa, he suggests training to focus all his power into a single spot. He tries several forms of target practice and increasing how much chakra he can infuse in his Rasengan. At sundown, Inojin and Chōchō return home, while Shikadai stays with Boruto, and the two discuss his training. Their talk turns to durability, and thinking back to Kakashi's advice, Boruto realises a way to focus his Rasengan. Kakashi watches them from afar. He goes to ask a favour from Ibiki.

After the three shadow clones are taken care of, Kakashi wonders where the real one is, only for the real Naruto to announce his presence and come barrelling at Kakashi with the intent of using One Thousand Years of Death.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Boruto attacks Deepa with a barrage of clones, which Deepa easily pelts with carbon. Sarada attacks from above, blocking the cubes on her way, but Deepa deflects her kunai with a ring of carbon cubes. Boruto and Sarada note the versatility of Deepa's jutsu. Deepa proclaims it's time to hunt. Sarada's explosive tag kunai and Boruto's electrified shuriken have no effect on Deepa. Boruto asks Sarada to buy him time to prepare his new Rasengan to push through Deepa's defence. Deepa reiterates his wish to know the flavour of the chakra fruit. Konohamaru fights Victor, who rationalises his goal as not wasting the sacrifice his employees made. He compares regular humans as nourishment and steppingstones for superior humans to the relationship between smaller and great nations. Konohamaru attacks him with Fire Release, which Victor blocks with Water Release. Sarada's Fire Release has no effect on Deepa, who sends a ring at Boruto, preventing him from building up his Rasengan. Sarada comments on the limited capabilities of a two-person team. Deepa boasts of his jutsu. Victor attacks with Earth Release and Fire Release, impressing Konohamaru, who only ever saw his grandfather using all changes in chakra nature. Victor prepares to strike him with Lightning Release, but is blocked by Orochimaru's snakes. Orochimaru makes it clear he's there not to save Konohamaru, but to reclaim his stolen Hashirama cells. Orochimaru blocks Victor's Fire Release with a summoned snake, which strikes and decapitates Victor. Victor regenerates his head, and counterattacks with Lightning Release, severing Orochimaru's arm, who also regenerates it. Orochimaru attacks with Wind Release, severing both of Victor's arms, who also regenerate, and breaking his peg leg. Orochimaru considers Victor's body interesting, but his regeneration to be imperfect, and surmises Victor wants to eat the chakra fruit to regain his lost body parts. Victor steadies himself with his extra arms. Deepa continues to overpower Sarada and Boruto. He almost lands a solid hit on Boruto, who is rescued at the last moment by Mitsuki, who joins the fight. Deepa shrugs off Mitsuki's Wind Release, blocks Boruto's advance, and breaks Sarada's kunai when she gets close. Deepa attacks them with carbon whips. Sarada is incredulous Deepa has yet to use his full strength. Deepa aims a big cube at Boruto, which Sarada blocks. Stressing her goal to become Hokage, Sarada's Sharingan gain a second tomoe. Deepa is angry at Team 7's lack of hopelessness. Mia arrives at the company and witnesses Victor's true form. The God Tree bud begins to open, so Victor approaches it, ignoring Mia's and Konohamaru's censure. The flower sends tendrils out to pull Victor in, and Orochimaru explains this is just a copy, and that mere humans can't handle the fruit. Deepa blocks Mitsuki's Lightning Release, dodges Sarada's taijutsu, and blocks Mitsuki's Wind Release before striking through him, who is actually a snake clone. Deepa grabs the real Mitsuki, and kicks him aside before dodging and blocking Sarada's taijutsu. Sarada's punch manages to chink Deepa's armour before he punches her aside. Boruto manages to attack with his Compression Rasengan. More cracks appear in Deepa's armour, who decides to fully cover himself in a black and white armour, and kicks Boruto aside. Orochimaru and his clones burn Victor's imitation God Tree with a barrier, and tells Konohamaru to leave. Boruto refuses to back down, Deepa grows angry when he sees bits of the burned God Tree falling down, and decides to kill the genin. Boruto prepares to attack again, and Sarada warns him about his arm. Deepa turns his gauntlet into diamond. Deepa and Boruto clash, Deepa's armour growing more cracks. Mitsuki supports Boruto, wrapping his arm around Boruto's and adding his senjutsu chakra to the attack. Sarada also adds her chakra to it. Together, they overpower Deepa, breaking his armour and body. Deepa considers how close he got to taste the world through the God Tree's fruit. He gets buried by falling debris. They leave the building with Konohamaru. Mitsuki dismisses Boruto's concern for his injuries, saying he'll heal fast. Mia is willing to testify on their behalf about the incident. Orochimaru leaves, telling Konohamaru he already notified Naruto. Konohamaru is glad Mitsuki was able to recover. Team 7 is glad to be together again.\\n\"},\n",

Denki walks by them, lost in thought, and doesn\\'t hear when they call him. At the Hokage\\'s office, Konohamaru and Mugino report to the higher ups, including the Fifth and Sixth Hokage. They explain they fought Victor and Deepa, who wished to cultivate a new God Tree and eat its chakra fruit. At Naruto\\'s request, Sai further investigated Victor\\'s facility, and uncovered research on symbols that match the ones they learned about from Shojoji, deducing that Victor and Deepa were members of Kara. Sai\\'s investigation also indicates they were aware of Naruto\\'s role in defeating Momoshiki, which is classified information. Naruto sent messengers to warn other Kage. Victor\\'s employees were unable to shed light into Victor\\'s personal research, where the word \"vessel\" was consistently mentioned. They are surprised to learn that the doctor responsible for the Fabrications was involved in Victor\\'s project. Kurotsuchi mentions they didn\\'t find his body at the time, and wonders if her grandfather was also involved. Hanabi finds it more likely the doctor used him to acquire experimental data. Konoha leadership is concerned that such a wide-reaching organisation had been unknown so far. When Konohamaru recalls Victor\\'s subordinates who were aware of his plan called themselves Outers, Sai recalls his mission with Sasuke in Amegakure, and consider that Kara has remained hidden by using outsider collaborators scattered across the nations. They consider the possibility of spies in the village. They weight the protection of the villagers against their freedom of movement. Denki has Team 7 help him take a balloon to the Hokage Rock, where they meet Metal Lee and Iwabee and help set it up. Naruto takes a day to decide whether to blockade the village gates. He learns that nowadays, identity checking isn\\'t as thorough as it used to be due to the high amount of people coming and going. Kōtarō supports restricting movement in and out of the village, citing the Byakuya Gang and the Mujina Bandits as examples. Iwabee and Metal Lee go up in Denki\\'s balloon, drawing Naruto\\'s attention. Denki explains it\\'s an experiment to improve the range of wireless transmissions. Metal loses the instructions Denki gave him, but Iwabee soldiers on. Denki manages to speak with his friend in another village, close to the border. Denki\\'s friends celebrate his success, even if the balloon isn\\'t able to maintain altitude to keep communications working for long. The following day, Naruto decides not to blockade the gates, and instead decides to overhaul the sensing system on the village. Victor reports to Jigen, placing blame of the incident on Deepa, and assuring him that none of their secrets were exposed, as he recovered Deepa\\'s body. Jigen considers the God Tree plan foolish. Victor decides to claim Jigen\\'s vessel.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"The Konoha Barrier Team run a successful trial of their new sensing system, using it to detect a disguised Sai. Several young shinobi are impressed, but Inojin is uninterested. Ino lectures them on the history of the barrier team, and how the new system has been improved and automated with the help of the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team. She explains that since the system can only detect unregistered chakra signatures once an intruder actually crosses the barrier, a swift response team is necessary. Ino has gathered shinobi with sensory skills to run an operational test and collect additional data. There will be organised infiltration teams, and their job will be to apprehend them. Boruto and Shikadai meet up with Inojin. Inojin explains he was asked to join because he scored good grades in sensing, having learned the basics from his mother from a young age. Boruto and Shikadai were asked to be part of the infiltration team, and as a chūnin, Shikadai was asked to memorise the newest additions to the Bingo Book. Fellow Yamanaka clansman Kohan introduces himself as Inojin's partner for the trial, and thanks them for their contribution. Kohan didn't know Ino had a grown son, and warns he won't pull any punches. Inojin says he's not his mother, and is surprised she's so well-regarded, as he only ever saw her work in the flower shop. Inojin and Kohan receive a breach notification and depart. Inojin isn't able to apprehend a single target that morning, and Kohan is surprised to learn he never actually sensed before. Ino is excited about the trial, but apologises for making Inojin participate when he has little interest in the subject, and says he doesn't have to be part of the afternoon test. Inojin confesses to Sai he thinks Ino is disappointed in him. Sai explains that beyond being a Yamanaka, the reason Ino takes such interest and pride in sensing is because of her father, who died in the war. She was inspired by him, and doesn't force Inojin because she wants to inspire him as well. Inojin asks Kohan to help him hone his sensing. During the afternoon test, Inojin is able to find Shikadai, but actually detected someone else near him. Kohan checks in with the team, but the chakra signature Inojin sensed was registered. Inojin is still concerned about it, and Shikadai, knowing Inojin, convinces Kohan to pursue the matter, arguing that as a trial, this data should be significant. They meet up with Boruto, and go investigate. The person whose chakra he detected, Mokume Arai, was not even in the village, having left the day before on the train for a friend's wedding. They discuss the possibilities, and Shikadai recalls something from reading the Bingo Book. Hyōi Yorishiro has the ability to mimic others' chakra, so he's capable of crossing the barrier without reading as an unrecognised signature. They report their findings and suspicions. They arrive at an area filled with people, and based on his earlier performance, Inojin doesn't think he can't cover such a wide area. Instead, he draws several birds with his Super Beast Imitating Drawing. As they're made with his chakra, he can use them as a medium to extend the scope of his sensing. They find and apprehend Hyōi. Kohan reports to Ino, who agrees Inojin isn't cut for sensing, but adds he doesn't have to be, and that's enough for her. She tells Inojin they'll make changes to the barrier to account for impostors. Inojin is worried she'll close the flower shop, but she says she treasures both, and tells him to do what he wants and not to worry.\\n\"},\n",

His parents remind him that today is a day of remembrance for those who died in the Fourth Shinobi World War. Many Konoha citizens gather at the cemetery, where Tsunade acts as speaker. She stresses how the peace they have today is due to those who lost their lives in the war, and that while the new generations don't know war, they should be told of what those who do learned from it. Ao goes to Katasuke's lab to ask for maintenance of his prosthetic arm, but Katasuke isn't in today. Mugino sees Ao and approaches him. Tsunade continues to address the crowd, who take turns offering flowers to the deceased. Ino and Shikamaru think back and talk about the last transmission they got from their fathers during the war, their last words. They wonder if some day they'll have to set the example and entrust the next generation to carry on. Later, Mugino takes Ao to the cemetery, and learns about his relationship to Katasuke. At Mugino's suggestion, Ao honours the deceased, and recalls his own survival. He spent years in a coma, and upon waking up, he learned of the deaths of so many friends, and went through arduous rehabilitation with Katasuke. He laments the fact he isn't as strong as he used to be before his injuries, and has retired from being a shinobi. He thanks Mugino for bringing him there to grieve. Shikamaru and Ino recognise and approach Ao, greeting him. Mugino is surprised to learn specifically who Ao is. Shikamaru asks Ao if his father truly believed his strategy to stop the Ten-Tails would work. Ao confesses he had doubts, and asked Shikaku and Inoichi the same. They said they were proud of their children and had faith in them. Shikamaru and Ino are moved. Ao leaves. At Temari's behest, Shikadai goes looking for his father. Shikamaru decides to take Shikadai to eat out, like they used to after training. He wonders if Shikadai is learning from looking at him as well.

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Victor finishes preparing an airship equipped with the latest stealth technology, and worries about his failing body, which can't handle the stress of his Regeneration Techniques. He crosses a space–time gate. Amado runs diagnostics on him, and reports his regeneration is declining. He offers to make him replacement body parts, but Victor refuses being his guinea pig again. He accuses Amado of being a mad scientist, who assures him all he does is for the advancement of Kara. He adds that Victor's health is being eroded by the cursed seal he used to extend his life, and replacing body parts won't solve the root of his problem. Amado is surprised Victor came to see him, as he hates him. Victor is agitated by how long Kara's plans are taking to advance, worried his body will give out before Kara's goals can be used to advance his own ambitions. Victor falls down in pain. Amado treats him before being called by Delta. Victor wakes up, having drugged himself beforehand to slip into a coma. He releases a spy drone to covertly copy data about the Vessel, a focal part of Kara's plan, which he also plans to steal. Amado finds Delta making a ruckus, and she complains that despite having him calibrate it, her right leg's reaction time is off. She wants him to do it again, but he explains Victor's in the infirmary, having had a seizure. Delta is surprised by his presence, and wishes he had died alongside Deepa. She also voices her hatred of him, Code, and Boro before leaving. Amado is called by Jigen, while Victor finishes copying the Vessel's data. Victor is surprised by phase 3 of the plans for the Vessel. Jigen asks Amado if the Vessel has reached phase 3, and why he wasn't notified immediately. Amado says he wanted to gather enough data to make sure of it as not to give Jigen false hope. Jigen wishes to test the Vessel on the surface, much to Amado's surprise, who thought tests were out of the question until the next phase. Jigen knows moving the Vessel will be noticed by shinobi, but it's a risk they have to take. Victor arrives, and having heard their talk, suggests they use his airship. Amado suspects his willingness to collaborate, but Victor plays up his worsening condition. Jigen approves, but Amado requires certain conditions, such as Victor not being aboard the airship, and being in charge of loading the Vessel and selecting the flight plan. Jigen watches as Victor leaves to begin preparations. In Konoha, Team 7 gets an official commendation for their role in resolving the issues in the Land of Valleys. Boruto asks his father to spar with him, which Naruto considers. The Vessel is loaded into the airship, and Delta is suspicious of Victor. Amado assures her that it's impossible to change its path from autopilot, and Delta says she'd love to slice them up should they fail. The airship takes off in stealth mode. At the Hokage Rock, Boruto removes his bandages, and recalls Momoshiki's words as he looks at the seal in his hand. Victor attempts to change the airship's path with a hidden mechanism, but something goes wrong and it crashes. Victor wonders if his plan was discovered, but considers that if that were so, they wouldn't have actually loaded the Vessel. At Kara's lair, Jigen is pensive.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto has yet to decide on what to give her, and intends buy her something when he gets payed for his missions later that day. Team 7 discusses Konohamaru's sudden departure for an urgent mission, so the genin have to go on missions without him. Sarada intends to take leadership in his absence. Walking through the village, Boruto sees a woman with a flower bouquet, and considers it as a gift for his mother. Boruto sees Mugino running by, and upon catching up with him, discovers he's running from restaurant owners, who want him to pay up the money he owes them. They know today is payday, so Mugino offers them his wallet, which barely has a coin in it. Mugino claims he gave his month's earnings to a kid with a sick sister. Boruto ends up having to pay for Mugino's debt, and is doubtful when Mugino says he'll pay him back next month. Mugino asks Boruto to take him to eat, spending the last of his money. Boruto questions why he doesn't ask Konohamaru for money as they've been friends for a long time, and is incredulous when Mugino says he considers it unethical, pointing out how he avoided paying the restaurant. Boruto is surprised that Mugino is like this, having previously found him to be serious and reliable from how he acted during missions. Mugino invites Boruto to his place to ask him for a favour. Mugino's apartment is poorly kept and sparsely furnished. Mugino explains he doesn't like the feeling of needing anything, or feeling like he doesn't want to lose thing, and wants to live as he was born, without any possessions. The apartment does have a nice view of the Hokage Rock, and Mugino explains he looks up to the Third Hokage, who looked after him after his parents died in a war. Boruto asks him to tell him about it. When he was a child, Mugino had been tasked with assassinating the Hokage when he visited a refugee camp. At night, Mugino tried to give Hiruzen flowers he picked, and opened his window. Mugino tried stabbing him while he looked for a flower vase, but Hiruzen blocked it, having figured he was an assassin by the way he moved, like he was being watched. Hiruzen noticed he had a cursed seal on him that could kill him at any moment. He allowed himself to be stabbed so Mugino's handlers lowered their guard, and used a shadow clone to defeat them. Mugino was shocked by it, and cried as Hiruzen apologised for creating a world where children were used as disposable weapons as he was. Hiruzen gave him a signed letter so that Konoha would welcome him, and wishes he would meet his grandson, who is of similar age to him. By the time, Mugino went to Konoha, Hiruzen had died, but he was able to enrol at the Academy. Mugino says not even Konohamaru knows this story. Boruto notices Mugino has a turtle, which Mugino explains he got roped into getting by a fortune-teller. He says the fortune hasn't come to pass, and the favour he has to ask is for Boruto to feed his turtle while he's away at a mission with Konohamaru, investigating a crash near the border. Mugino is sorry Boruto can't buy his mother a gift. The kid from Mugino's story comes by and thanks him for giving him money which he used to buy medicine for his sister, and gives him a basket of flowers. Mugino gives Boruto the flowers, as they'll wilt while he's gone. He also gives him a key to his apartment so he can feed his turtle. Boruto tells him to look after Konohamaru. Katasuke provides Naruto with his latest prosthetic hand, and is excited to hear about what Naruto thinks of it. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss Katasuke's disposition, and muse over still not knowing who put him under genjutsu. Naruto intends to test the prosthetic sparring with Boruto. Boruto arrives home and shows Himawari the flowers, saying their mother will have plenty of flowers to put on the vase Himawari made her.\\n\"},\n",

Most of them blame Victor, who tries to deflect it to Amado, whose absence in the meeting he questions. Jigen says that Amado is busy with matters that no longer concern Victor. Koji Kashin offers to retrieve the Vessel, as the airship carrying it did so in an area under his jurisdiction. The rest of the other Inners present agree to let him handle it and Koji says he will contact the Outer agent to assist. After the meeting is over, Victor considers retrieving the Vessel himself, and is glad his theft of the Vessel's data hasn't been discovered. He disparages Koji, who answers back, revealing he was in the same room as Victor since the beginning of the meeting. Victor moves to attack him, but Koji strikes first. Victor maintains someone tampered with his airship, but Koji incinerates him, his jutsu strong enough to overcome Victor's regeneration. Koji also destroys the drone with the stolen data. Amado has informed Jigen of what Deepa knew, having regenerated his head and brain enough for him to report back. Having no further use for Deepa, Jigen has Amado dispose of his head. Koji reports having dealt with Victor to Jigen, who in turn informs him of the precise coordinates of the airship crash, and orders him to kill anyone who has seen the airship. Konohamaru and Mugino approach the crash site. Several genin gather to watch the sparring between Boruto and Naruto. Mitsuki helps Boruto prepare. Boruto is happy his father managed to keep a promise, and is glad to have an opportunity to make up for past mistakes and show him that his grown from his training. Shikamaru confirms with Naruto he hasn't told Boruto he'll be testing a new prosthetic hand. The sparring begins with Boruto using shadow clones as decoys to attack Naruto from behind. He throws a Rasengan, which Naruto extinguishes. Boruto uses electrified shuriken to blind him, so he only spots the Rasengan when it's near him, but Naruto extinguishes it again. Boruto wants to clash their Rasengan, and uses shadow clones to propel himself at Naruto. The Boruto who has the Rasengan is a shadow clone, and real one attacks from afar with a Water Release and Lightning Release combo. Naruto blocks it with an Earth Release wall. He punches through the wall and absorbs Boruto's jutsu. Boruto heads to the wall, but Naruto kicks him from behind, knocking him down, ending the match. Naruto acknowledges Boruto's growth. Later, Naruto confirms to Boruto his prosthetic hand was a scientific ninja weapon, explaining that Katasuke developed it based on Momoshiki's ability, though it isn't capable of releasing the jutsu it absorbs. Boruto admonishes Naruto for using it when he chastised Boruto for using them before. Sasuke arrives and points out the difference is in how they're used. Sarada asks when he came back, and he says he just returned from investigating Kara. Konohamaru and Mugino enter the crashed airship and find an empty container.

Sumire explains some of her efforts to learn how to coexist with Nue as part of the research team. Akita is excited to have Katasuke's latest prototype to test. Despite their enthusiasm and Katasuke's insistence that how they're used matters, Boruto remains unconvinced of scientific ninja tools' value. As part of their mission, Team 7 helps to test other tools, some of which Boruto even has fun testing. Tending to an injury Boruto sustained testing one of the tools, Sumire explains she wants to develop a tool to keep Nue from getting out of control so she can support the village, and lets him know that she'll be relocating back to Konoha to act as Katasuke assistant. Boruto notices a plaque with Katasuke's creed of science being used to support others. Akita's ninken Chamaru befriends Boruto, who notices he has a prosthetic leg.

Katasuke points out the short moment required for the absorption sphere to form on the arm, which Konohamaru wants Boruto to use to absorb Ao's own jutsu bullets while going in for the final blow. Boruto attempts to use the chakra katana provided by Katasuke, but collapses from its chakra consumption. Boruto will have to activate the katana in the last possible moment. Katasuke makes adjustments to Boruto's jutsu absorbing arm. Their strategy is decided. While on the move, Ao is approached by Koji Kashin, who questions Ao's commitment due to the others' escape. Ao assures him that much like the scientific ninja tools keeping him alive, he is Kara's tool. Koji Kashin is pleased to hear it, and warns Ao of the Konoha shinobi's intent to defeat him, including having developed a strategy. He is more concerned with the possibility of them acquiring the vessel, and stresses that to be his mission. Approaching the ruins where the Konoha-nin regrouped, Ao attacks a hidden Mitsuki with his scientific ninja tools. Mitsuki attacks Ao with Lightning Release, Konohamaru and Sarada with Fire Release. Ao notes them to be unconcerned with chakra consumption as he absorbs their attacks, and concludes they're the distraction for an attack by Boruto. Boruto strikes with the chakra katana from above, but Ao blocks it with his own chakra blade, knocking Boruto back, claiming Boruto's chakra katana, and using it to stab him. Ao tells Boruto he saw through his attack, but Boruto denies it, gripping Ao's hand so he can't let go of the chakra katana. Mitsuki extends his arm and further wraps around Ao's hand. The Boruto Ao stabbed vanishes, being a shadow clone, and Ao feels his strength drained by the chakra katana. Ao uses the tools in his other arm to force Mitsuki into releasing his grip. The real Boruto moves in to strike, using his own jutsu absorbing arm to counter Ao's, leaving him free to land a Rasengan. Boruto uses Ao's own words about how tools are used against him.\\n\"},\n",

He does allow her to go check on it if she wishes, but stresses it's still Koji's mission, so she's to take his lead and report back to Jigen if there are further issues. Delta wants to know what Koji is thinking. Code watches her from afar, thinking her to be simple-minded. Amado asks Jigen if it's wise to let Delta go, but Jigen is unconcerned. He asks Amado not to let anyone near him for a while. Delta recruits Garō to go retrieve the vessel in the Land of Fire. The Konoha shinobi are concerned by the boy having the same Kāma as Boruto. Boruto feels pain on his Kāma hand, and the boy grunts in pain as well. Kawaki dreams back to being sold by his father to Jigen. Kawaki begins waking up, screaming not to touch him. Everyone falls back as energy surges from him. When the dust settles, Kawaki asks if they're Kara trackers. Konohamaru introduces the group as Konoha shinobi. Koji watches from afar, and is joined by Delta. Telling she has Jigen's permission, she asks why he's letting the situation unfold, specially after he reveals Ao is dead. She tells him she brought Garō with her, to Koji's annoyance. Kawaki doesn't trust the Konoha shinobi when they ask about the airship crash, and becomes hostile when seeing Boruto's Kāma. From afar, Delta is likewise shocked, while Koji remains observant. The Konoha shinobi and Kawaki are interrupted by Garō, who attacks and declares he'll take back the vessel. From Garō's words, the Konoha shinobi deduce Kawaki is the vessel. Garō and Kawaki trade insults as they begin to fight while the others watch.\\n\"},\n",

He hands over the data they collected from the airship, and inquires about Kawaki, who had the same Kāma as Boruto. Before allowing him to enter Konoha, they're examining him in Katasuke's lab in Ryūtan. While Naruto worries that he is a child being pursued by Kara, the others are more cautions over his violent instincts. Konohamaru also reports that Koji Kashin used the Rasengan. At the Ryūtan facility, Kawaki is kept handcuffed in a room. Akita and Katasuke report what they learned about Kawaki to Team 7. Katasuke also warns Sumire that Nue might react badly to Kawaki. Kawaki tries breaking through the reinforced door of his confinement, but is unable to do it. Katasuke fills the room with sleeping gas. Kawaki dreams back to Jigen and his father. After he wakes up, Team 7 and Sumire bring him food, but he kicks it aside, thinking it's poisoned. Sumire tells him where they are, and they leave. Kawaki requests to use the bathroom. Naruto and Sai depart to Ryūtan to ascertain whether Kawaki is an enemy or not. Kawaki uses a Smoke-Flash Bomb he pockets from a scientist to escape through a bathroom vent. The alarm goes off, warning the facility of his escape. Sumire feels responsible for telling Kawaki there were scientific ninja tools on the facility, and runs into him. She tries to restrain him, but he overpowers her with a shinobi gauntlet. In response, Nue attacks Kawaki, injuring his arm. Kawaki flees while Sumire tries calming Nue down.

Weakened from blood loss, Kawaki wants to eat so his arm can regenerate faster. He considers stealing from food stalls, but decides against so as not to draw attention from security personnel after him. He grabs a loaf of bread that falls from a delivery stall, and subdues a stray dog that attacks him for the bread. Kawaki notices the dog is injured, bandages the wound, and lets the dog have the bread. Sumire and Nue follow the blood trail, and Sumire thinks back to his words. The stray dog keeps following Kawaki despite his antagonism. Unable to find Kawaki at the station, Team 7 decides to go get intel from Sumire. Naruto and Sai discuss the concerns about having Kawaki in the village. The stray dog steals meat from a butcher. Sumire sees the dog, and recognises the bandage as being from this hospital gown Kawaki is wearing. The butcher pushes Sumire aside pursuing the dog. The dog brings Kawaki the food, but the butcher wounds him. Sumire finds Kawaki by following the butcher, whom Kawaki intimidates over mistreating the dog. He also threatens Sumire, who helps treat the dog instead, and apologises for Nue hurting him. She compares his attitude towards the dog with his own self-image. She shares her past with Kawaki. He gets agitated by the sight of an injection, and attacks Sumire. Team 7 and the facility personnel find them. The personnel attack him, but Kawaki flees.

His attention was drawn to a seller's goldfish. While he had no money, the seller informed him of a festival where he could see many goldfish for free. One of Kawaki's customers informs the goldfish seller of Kawaki's background, including how his drunk father beats him and uses all the money Kawaki makes on booze. Arriving home, Kawaki hands his father the booze he bought. The father is dismissive of Kawaki, and prevents him from getting dinner when he finds the pamphlet on the goldfish festival. Kawaki continues to cut wood and use the money to buy booze for his father. One day, physicians show up on his village and ask to draw his blood to see if he has a plague that has been going around the region. Kawaki runs away and bumps into two bigger kids, who make fun of him and his father. Kawaki defends his father, and the kids punch him to the ground. Before they can do more, the goldfish seller threatens them with a staff. The seller says he has a similar background, and offers to take Kawaki with him and teach his trade. He offers Kawaki a tissue to clean up his wound. Kawaki says he can't abandon his father, and rushes back home with a cracked bottle of booze. Delta collects the discarded tissue with Kawaki's blood on it. He trips and the bottle breaks. At home, his father locks him up for breaking the bottle. Jigen arrives at his house and offers money to buy Kawaki. His father agrees, and when Kawaki protests it, his father beats him with a bottle. Jigen gives the father his money and takes custody of Kawaki. Jigen takes Kawaki to the only tunnel leading away from his village. The goldfish seller appears, and revealing himself as a trafficker, wants Kawaki for himself over the trouble he went to get the boy to trust him. Jigen has Kawaki go outside the tunnel, and later emerges alone. Kawaki confesses he wanted a goldfish. He takes him to a Kara headquarter and tells Amado to treat him courteously. He says he'll give him a special present. Kawaki wakes up in the presence of Naruto, Shikamaru, and Konohamaru. Naruto tells him he's in a safe place.\\n\"},\n",

Naruto properly introduces himself to Kawaki, who remains silent. Shikamaru argues against harbouring Kawaki based on Konohamaru's report. Naruto counters that as a jinchūriki, he might have been placed under the same strict security Shikamaru wants to place on Kawaki if it wasn't for the Third Hokage's interference, but agrees that decision isn't his alone. During the Five Kage Summit, Katasuke and Naruto report what Konoha has learned about Kawaki. Through use of shadow clones, Naruto proposes to physically monitor Kawaki at all times, which the other Kage agree to support.

They pee outside, and begin fighting after trading insults. They activate their Kāma, but Naruto creates a shadow clone from the bathroom to stop their fight. During a meal, Boruto comments how unusual it is for Naruto to be at home all day long, and reiterates he hasn't forgiven Kawaki for breaking Himawari's vase.

Chōchō is interested in Kawaki, and Sarada tries to be friendly by suggesting which snack Kawaki should have, though he ignores her suggestion. Naruto treats them in addition to buying snacks for himself and Kawaki. Kawaki is taken aback how much he enjoys his snack. Naruto tells Kawaki to let her have a bite of his snack, which she has never had, but he refuses. A boy bumps into Kawaki, who transforms his arm to attack. Naruto stops and prevents him from harming the boy. Kawaki advises the boy to be careful, telling him there's danger everywhere. Sarada and Kawaki argue over his outburst.

Sarada asks Boruto how Kawaki is, recalling his outbursts when she spent time with him and Naruto. Naruto arrives and offers to postpone his sparring with Boruto over the visitors. Boruto says it's no problem, and Naruto invites Kawaki to watch. Boruto and Naruto begin to spar, Kawaki recognising when Boruto uses shadow clones. He tells Boruto to just use the Kāma already, activating his so Boruto's activates in response, as Boruto still can't activate it at will. Sparring resumes, Naruto and the spectators both noticing the increase in Boruto's performance. Boruto's Lightning Release is even strong enough to dispel one of Naruto's shadow clones. Boruto manages to trick Naruto with a shadow clone, but ends up defeated. He's unsatisfied with his performance, but Naruto credits him on fighting smarter.

He gets close to her, so she fires her eye beams, which he blocks with a Big Ball Rasengan. Delta begins absorbing it, so Naruto ups the ante by growing it into an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan. Boruto realises his strategy. Delta mocks Naruto for thinking she can't absorb bigger jutsu. Kawaki finds the strategy futile, but Boruto corrects him that's not what Naruto is doing. Delta realises Naruto's plan, and Boruto explains to Kawaki he's trying to overtax her absorption. Her shinobi-ware overheats, her eyes ceasing to function. Naruto explains he realised that when she fired back his Rasengan, it meant it was stored somewhere, and such storage would have a limit.

Naruto suggests using one of the prototypes made for him. Katasuke explains prosthetics are made to react to the wearer's chakra, so Naruto decides to keep constantly moulding chakra while he's awake to keep it functioning. He dismisses Kawaki's concern by pointing out the situation is an example of chakra as a connecting force. Boruto comments on how cool it looks and jokes about wanting one. Kawaki offers to blast off his hand, wondering if it would get rid of Boruto's Kāma. Boruto explains he was joking while Naruto and Katasuke laugh.

Kurama corrects him, explaining the parallels between Naruto's life and Kawaki's, and summarising all the antagonism it posed to Naruto through the years, from causing him to hurt those close to him, to how the village mistreated him for being Kurama's jinchūriki. It comments on the irony of Naruto's use of the Shadow Clone Technique and his loneliness, Kawaki himself recalling Naruto's words on the jutsu. Kurama continues, mentioning how it saw Naruto fill his heart up through the years, and how he's at his strongest when protecting his friends.

Kawaki continues to deny him, as he disparages Naruto and the village. His Kāma spreads further, manifesting a horn, much to Jigen's surprise. Kurama berates Naruto for taking so long to remove the rods, and Naruto enters his chakra mode, kicking Jigen aside and checking on Kawaki. Jigen spreads his Kāma and begins fighting Naruto. Naruto dodges the rods, but gets hit by one getting Konohamaru out of the way. Jigen prepares a blast, much to Koji's surprise, and Kawaki offers to return with him if he lets Naruto go unharmed. Jigen agrees to it, but Naruto is unwilling to let Kawaki give himself up, so Jigen portals himself and Naruto to a different dimension. He intends to leave Naruto stranded, but Sasuke arrives, changing his plans to deal with both of them there.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Naruto is initially unimpressed by Jigen's new horn, but Sasuke informs him of the Ōtsutsuki\\u200e site he found and a new clan member he discovered. Jigen is surprised Sasuke discovered the place. Sasuke carries on revealing the existence of the juvenile Ten-Tails to Naruto, and speculates Jigen's intent to drain chakra from all the planet. Sasuke manifests his Complete Body Susanoo, prompting Naruto to fully manifest Kurama. Sasuke attacks, but Jigen is disappointed by Susanoo's speed, and kicks Sasuke out of it, putting a multiple rods through him. Jigen goes towards Sasuke, who switches places with him. Naruto attacks with Kurama's tails, but Jigen simply pins them down with more rods, and punches Naruto out of his Tailed Beast Mode. Naruto prepares a Rasengan, but Sasuke switches places with him at the last second, attempting to behead Jigen with his sword. Jigen manifests rods from his neck, blocking Sasuke's sword, and kicks him away. Jigen lands physical attacks on Naruto, and Sasuke attempts to burn him with Amaterasu. Jigen absorbs them with his Kāma. Sasuke is concerned that if he spends more chakra, he won't be able to use space-time ninjutsu. Jigen notices a crack on a blackened section of his body, wondering if his power is too much for this body to contain, reaffirming his need for Kawaki as his next vessel. Jigen decides to end things, and pins Naruto and Sasuke with rods from below. Considering Naruto to take too much work to kill due to Kurama, Jigen decides to seal him instead, and begins closing the lid of the place they're in. However, as Sasuke can teleport, he intends to kill him then and there. Naruto creates shadow clones to buy time for Sasuke to escape, reasoning that if they can't defeat Jigen, one of them has to escape. Sasuke teleports back to Konoha, appearing next to Sakura. Naruto teases Jigen about not being able to track Sasuke with Kāma like he can Kawaki, and wonders why he's sealing him instead of killing him. Kurama manifests itself, telling Naruto not to give him a reason to do it, as he had no issue with him before. Jigen agrees with Kurama, and asks about Boruto, revealing he knows about Boruto's Kāma. He promises to kill Naruto next time they meet if he's still alive, which Naruto says right back at Jigen. He finishes closing the lid, and shrinks the seal down. The blackened section of his body cracks more, and Jigen begins to tear up. Dismissing Jigen's pain, Isshiki Ōtsutsuki doesn't consider him to be a worthy vessel and teleports away. At Konoha, Sarada meets Kawaki at Naruto's house and asks about him. Kawaki drops a photo of Naruto, as his hand no longer functions without Naruto's chakra, much to his shock.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Kawaki stares at his fallen prosthetic hand. Sarada asks him what happened. Boruto and Mitsuki arrive. Sarada tells them Naruto is missing. Shikamaru arrives with backup and pins Kawaki down with his shadow. Shikamaru says what the Sensor Unit reported to him and demands an explanation from Kawaki. He gives a signal to a subordinate, and a barrier goes up around the house. Shikamaru explains it's to both keep Kawaki from fleeing and keeping enemy reinforcements out. Shikamaru orders his subordinates to look in the house in pairs for clues. He unpins Kawaki and asks what happened. Kawaki explains Jigen suddenly appeared when his Kāma began hurting, forming a a crack in the air. Shikamaru recognises it as space–time ninjutsu. Sarada questions why he'd take Naruto if he was after Kawaki, who explains it was to eliminate Naruto for interfering. Shikamaru and Mitsuki note that if it was just to take him out of the day, it would only take a moment, leading Shikamaru to deduce they're either still fighting, or that best case scenario, Naruto defeated Jigen but can't come back. Boruto mentions Sasuke, who he knows to have space–time ninjutsu, but Shikamaru hasn't heard from him since his most recent mission. Shikamaru asks if there's anything else Kawaki hasn't said. He bluntly says he has never trusted Kawaki, and suspects Kawaki has been a Kara member all along, Naruto's disappearance only deepening his concern. Kawaki finds no fault in his logic. With Naruto absent, it falls on Shikamaru to decide what to do with Kawaki, so he decides for house arrest until they have proof he's not a spy. Boruto protests but Kawaki accepts it. Koji finds the situation unusual. He determines that Jigen ended up using too much chakra, and finds it a rare opportunity of being able to take Jigen down himself, and leaves to head back to base. Amado tends to Jigen and determines it'll take two days for his chakra to fully recharge. Jigen says he got carried away by how happy he was, due to how Kawaki's Kāma is developing. Amado speculates if that is due to the resonance with Boruto's Kāma, an idea Jigen supports. Jigen believes they'll both become powerful Ōtsutsuki, and a giant God Tree will grow. He reassures Amado his wishes will be granted. Amado glances at Delta, who tells him off. Boruto refuses to believe Kawaki is a spy, but Shikamaru explains he has to be contained because they can't tell it either way. Boruto brings up Kawaki sacrificing his arm to protect Naruto and Himawari, but having heard Kara's scientist might be able to fix it, Shikamaru things it would be a good way to earn their trust, and if there is a plan, they wouldn't try killing one of their own. Kawaki thinks of Naruto, and wonders why he was good to him. Sarada understands him, and reveals she has wondered how her life would be better if Naruto was her father. She confesses being jealous of Boruto, and annoyed at his ignorance of how lucky he is. While Boruto is arguing with Shikamaru, one of his subordinates arrives with the repaired vase, wondering if it's a tool for a jutsu. Boruto takes it, berating him for thinking something so stupid, and marvels at it being fixed. Kawaki points out he's the one who complained about it, and that there's still a small hole in it. Shikamaru still doesn't accept it as proof Kawaki isn't a spy. Kawaki's prosthesis lights up with Naruto's chakra, Kawaki taking it as proof Naruto is alive. Kawaki can sense Naruto's chakra through the prosthesis, and looking at his Kāma, he asks for Boruto's assistance. Kawaki activates his Kāma, forming a portal like Jigen's, and Boruto's Kāma resonates, activating and contributing to the portals formation. Kawaki makes a realisation he can do the same things as Jigen because he's like him, and decides to go rescue Naruto. Boruto denies Kawaki is anything like Jigen. Shikamaru pins the children with his shadow, with no intention of letting them go. Kawaki breaks it by absorbing it, and warns the portal will close soon. Mitsuki grabs Sarada and Boruto and jumps through. Kawaki goes through it, telling Shikamaru he's going to get his proof. They arrive at another dimension, and find Boro guarding the kettle containing Naruto. Boro and Kawaki recognise one another, and Kawaki explains Boro is also a Kara Inner, and in some ways, worse than Jigen.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Kawaki stresses they must avoid Boro's mist, which continues to affect them even after they got out of its range. Sarada and Boruto are confused, because she saw him weave hand seals, meaning it's ninjutsu, while Boruto points out Kāma couldn't absorb it, despite having no trouble doing so to his Lava Release. Kawaki explains Kāma can only absorb chakra-based substances, for example, a Water Release created by one's own chakra, but not a Water Release which controls already existing water, concluding Boro's mist isn't chakra-based. Mitsuki reveals he had his snake trap a bit of the mist, and asks Sarada to focus her Sharingan so they can learn what it is. Mitsuki warns her she'll only have one chance to analyse it before it disperses, and cautions her not to get in contact with it. Sarada is able to determine the mist is made of viruses, meaning the others were infected and are sick. Mitsuki is glad to confirm his hypothesis, which he formulated based on the symptoms they displayed. Since they also don't know of any ninjutsu which creates viruses, they conclude that Boro creates them through scientific ninja tools. Mitsuki has an idea to deal with the viruses, but stresses they need a commander, and based on her earlier idea to retreat, nominates Sarada. Sarada moves out and addresses Boro, saying they figured out his jutsu. Sarada asks him what he thinks they should do, and Boro says no ninjutsu can be used against it, and charges at her. He uses his Lava Release, which she counters with her Fire Release, maintaining a distance between them. Sarada notices he lacks speed, and uses a wide spread Fire Release, which he blocks with a water wall. Sarada loses sight of Boro, and realises he's circling her, leaving her surrounded by viruses. Sarada jumps, as Boro expected, allowing him to intercept her and toss her down where his viruses are. Boro tells her the virus acts fast, and picks her up. He dismisses her sign weaving, and she tells him she can't miss from that close a distance. She hits him a Fire Release to the face, and follows up with a punch and a signal to Boruto and Kawaki, who can move again. She notices Boro's hand seals. The boys both have their Kāma activated, and Boruto lands a Rasengan, which is augmented by Kawaki, destroying Boro's head and much of his upper body. Mitsuki arrives and they celebrate the anti-bodies working. Boro stirs, gets up, and regenerates. Kawaki curses his regeneration abilities being greater than he anticipated. Boro is confused on how they got anti-bodies to counteract the virus, as they only exist in his bloodstream, before realising Mitsuki collected some of his blood when his snake bit him. Mitsuki says he likes to collect things, attributing it to Orochimaru's influence, and that if the attack happened to be actual viruses instead of ninjutsu, Boro would be the one to have anti-bodies against it. Boruto taunts him that his attack won't work anymore. The four surround him, and Boro rushes to attack Naruto's seal, causing Kawaki to break formation and go after him.\\n\"},\n",

Despite the explosion hitting him, Kawaki moves in to check on the kettle containing Naruto. Boro is disappointed by Kawaki's change of attitude. Boruto stresses Kawaki should be more careful, though Kawaki assures him he'll heal right away. Boro comments they'll have to retrain Kawaki, Boruto says Kawaki is a Konoha citizen now, and Boro responds they'll be taking him as well for his Kāma. Boruto and Mitsuki go on the offensive. Boruto destroys Boro's hand with a Rasengan, but Boro regenerates it instantly, and continues to counterattack against the two. Sarada avoids using Fire Release and Lightning Release so as not to spark Boro's gunpowder, and tries shuriken, but Boro melts them with his Lava Release. Mitsuki elongates his arms and restrains Boro long enough for Kawaki to explode him with Kāma, destroying his lower body. Boro regenerates once more. Kawaki asks Boruto and Mitsuki to buy him time. As the two fight Boro, Kawaki explains to Sarada that Boro's strategy is to make them exhaust their chakra with his regeneration, but that there's a way to neutralise it. Boruto attacks with shadow clones, Mitsuki attacks with snakes, and Boro once again creates gunpowder explosions, this time igniting it himself. Kawaki shares how all Kara members had their bodies modified by Amado with scientific ninja tools but even with all his genius technical skills, his design is still not flawless and that the bigger the tools are the larger their core is. For how strong Boro's regeneration is, there has to be at least a heart-sized core responsible for it, and if they can find and destroy that core, he won't regenerate anymore. Sarada points out they've destroyed all of his body parts by now, so they should have destroyed it already. He tells her to look for it with her Sharingan, and joins the others in attacking Boro. Mitsuki attacks with Lightning Release, so Boro throws gunpowder his way. Just before Kawaki blows Boro's head up, Sarada notices him weaving hand seals. She saw a slight movement in his muscles, and confirms something is moving inside him when Boruto lands another Rasengan on him, the last one he has chakra for. Sarada determines the core is in his right flank, but can't inform the others without alerting Boro, so she decides to destroy it herself. Boro resumes attacking the others. Sarada goes through her jutsu in her head, discarding the ones not strong enough to penetrate his body. She's also concerned he'll move the core the moment he notices her taking aim, and concludes she needs something faster than he can weave hand seals. She only has one such jutsu, which she's still practising, and hasn't used in battle. Sarada prepares a Chidori, which Boruto recognises as Sasuke's jutsu. Boro prepares to weave seals, but is not fast enough and is hit on his flank by Sarada's Chidori.\\n\"},\n",

Mitsuki regains consciousness just in time to see Momoshiki kill Boro with a gigantic Rasengan. Kawaki also regains consciousness. Momoshiki comments that Boruto is still ways away from losing everything as Boruto\\'s Kāma recedes. Mitsuki catches Boruto as he falls. Boruto wakes up with no recollection of what happened.

He takes Kawaki to see Naruto, who\\'s also being visited by Sasuke, Sai, Shikamaru, Sarada, and Mitsuki. They all coordinate what they know. Shikamaru asks for confirmation that Jigen is an Ōtsutsuki. Sasuke reveals that Jigen had a Ten-Tails hidden in another dimension, which he can no longer access. Sai speculates they might have changed its coordinates. Boruto details how Boro fought, and that Sarada successfully used Chidori against him. Sarada explains what Boro said about making people believe in miracles with his virus. Kawaki explains that all Kara members, including himself, were modified by a scientist named Amado. He also reveals one more Kara Inner, Code, though he knows nothing about his abilities. Shikamaru finds Kawaki\\'s lack of knowledge strange, and asks if he knows why he\\'s called a vessel.

Boruto confesses to not remembering the end of the fight with Boro. Sarada and Mitsuki exchange looks. Sakura arrives and insists Naruto must rest.

Hinata can't find ham she had bought. Boruto invites Kawaki to go train with him and Mitsuki, but Kawaki finds it dangerous to train with him, as their Kāma are resonating and further changing their bodies. He writes a note to Naruto. Himawari gets food while Hinata vacuums the house and leaves. Kawaki notices and asks why she's sneaking out. She explains she's been feeding a wolf she calls Jaggy for the past week. Kawaki notices the wolf has several scars on him. While he snarls at Kawaki, he's friendly with Himawari. He thinks the wold should get his own food, but Himawari convinces him to help her get food. They speculate on why Jaggy is the way he is. Kawaki relates to the wolf. When they return, other wolves are snarling at Jaggy, but leave as they approach.

Shikamaru shows up, knowing where Kawaki is because of his surveillance. He stops him from leaving the village.

Jigen speculates Sasuke is responsible, but Delta believes it was someone much stronger. Jigen sends Code on his task and orders Delta to return. In Konoha, Shikamaru and Sai tell Konohamaru about Boro's cult. Because they believe the cult can give them answers about Kara, Naruto assigns Sai and Konohamaru to infiltrate it. The two intend to find the teleportation device Kawaki told Konoha that Kara uses to move around. They're welcomed by Akari, who informs them Boro is busy, and might not show up that day. She tells them of her background, and that her brother was chosen by Boro to communicate with the gods directly. Akari directs them to Shirabe and Tsuzumi, who might know when Boro will be present.

Akari asks about her brother Kagari, and they claim that Boro informed them that Kagari's role was expanded, and that should be proud of her brother.

When they discover something in the room's books, Tsuzumi throws a virus bottle at them and runs. They catch up to him, and reveal they're immune to the virus because their friends fought Boro.

Denki and Iwabee debate whether the theft was facilitated by the data being digital instead of on paper. Inojin comments on how the village's Barrier Team detected no foreign chakra signatures, leading Shikadai to consider an inside job. Chōchō wants to catch the intruder, and convinces her team-mates to help her. They find the tower where Koji was staying, and a computer with blueprints of the archive facility. Inojin spots someone nearby, who turns out to be Kakashi. He claims to be just walking around, but Shikadai deduces he's looking for the intruder as well, by himself instead of as a part of a group so as not to draw attention. They show Kakashi their discovery, and he suggests they continue investigating together, giving them earpieces. The four watch the tower, and spot Koji, but he switches directions midway to it. Inojin follows him from the sky on one of his drawings, but loses him in a crowd. Kakashi says the intruder noticed he'd been made, so he abandoned the hideout, and will try to leave the village. He considers the intruder went into the sewers to make it appear he vanished in the crowd. Knowing the intruder is dangerous from his moves and from the jōnin he took out in the archives, Kakashi goes after him alone, and instructs Team 10 to notify the jōnin on watch to seal the exists. Shikadai realises the intruder will leave the sewer not on the outskirts of the village, but on a Thunder Rail station. Kakashi is too far to make it in time, and Team 10 arrives as a train is leaving. Chōchō enlarges her arms and throws Shikadai and Inojin on the train. Shikadai paralyses Koji, but as Inojin gets close to unmask him, the shadow clone dissipates. Koji takes out guards and infiltrates another archive facility, but Kakashi arrived before him. After being contacted by Shikadai, he realised that Koji was trying to lure the extra security away by pretending to leave the village, so he could steal data archived on physical scrolls, yet to be digitised. Wanting to know how he slipped past the Sensing Barrier, Kakashi attacks him with Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, but it's a shadow clone again. Koji creates a smokescreen and escapes. He thinks to himself the data had nothing to do with his goal and wonders if he's getting sentimental. He's confused by the lack of a counterattack by Jigen to retrieve Kawaki, and realises his last fight took a lot of his chakra. Team 10 and Team 5 discuss the chase at Senju Park. Shikadai goes talk to Kakashi, and speculates that since the physical data was only from past shinobi, the intruder might be one of these past shinobi. Considering that, Kakashi adds that the intruder's chakra might be registered, explaining why the barrier detected no intrusions. Koji returns to Kara's headquarters and meets Amado. He informs Koji of Jigen's condition, and that all other Inners are away. They mean for Koji to kill Jigen.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Koji confirms he was created to kill Jigen. Watching the transmission at Konoha, Naruto asks why they're fighting if they're both Kara members. Amado explains they were both pretending to be Kara, their true objective being killing Jigen. As he was severely drained from the fight against Naruto and Sasuke, this is an opportunity they won't have again. Jigen considers Koji to be a mere tool used by Amado, and Koji is ok with it, as that's what he considers shinobi to be. Koji attacks with Fire Release, which Jigen absorbs with Kāma. While doing so, Koji positions himself behind Jigen, drenches him in oil, and places several toads on him, which burn more intensely because of the oil. Kawaki doesn't think it'll make a difference because of the Kāma. Naruto recognises Koji's fighting style. Jigen absorbs the flames and engages in taijutsu against Koji. Koji uses shadow clones, but Jigen evades it and pierces one with his rods. Jigen avoids another shadow clone by shrinking, and pierces it as well. Jigen comments on Koji's seriousness in wanting him dead, and hopes he's prepared to die. Koji feels the same, and addresses Jigen as Isshiki Ōtsutsuki. Amado explains that Isshiki came to their planet as Kaguya's partner, per the usual Ōtsutsuki expansion method he already explained. For reasons unknown to Amado, Kaguya turned on Isshiki, leaving him on the verge of death. He only survived by taking over a novice monk that happened to be nearby, Jigen. Sasuke asks if that's when Jigen was marked with Kāma. Before continuing, Amado confirms with Naruto his asylum deal, and won't remove Shikadai's collar until he has the deal in writing. Naruto does so, and Amado continues. Using Boruto and Momoshiki as an example, he reveals that Kāma is actually replicated data from an Ōtsutsuki that is implanted, comparing it to a compressed backup file. Overtime, that file is uncompressed, overwriting the will of the person marked with it until the Ōtsutsuki who made it is reborn. Naruto asks if there's a way to block the process. Amado isn't aware of any, though he speculates that killing Boruto before he's overwritten would work. Sasuke asks what happens to the Kāma in the case of a successful resurrection. Amado believes it would simply vanish, and Sasuke points out that Isshiki has taken over Jigen, but Jigen still bears a Kāma. Amado chuckles, angering Shikamaru. Amado observes Sasuke's point, and explains that Isshiki didn't take over Jigen through usual means. Implanting a Kāma is a significant under-taking, something Isshiki didn't have enough power to do while near death. Instead, he shrunk himself, and physically entered Jigen's body, acting as a parasite until he took over his brain, only implanting a Kāma at a later point. Jigen extends his Kāma and continues to fight Koji. Koji immobilises Jigen with an Earth Release. Naruto questions why Isshiki hasn't revived through Jigen. Amado explains that selecting an appropriate vessel is essential for a successful rebirth. Jigen was the only available vessel for Isshiki at the time, and his body isn't strong enough to sustain a fully restored Isshiki, so Isshiki through Jigen began preparing a more resilient vessel, Kawaki. Jigen escapes Koji's Earth Release by shrinking and sends more rods his way, which Koji dodges. Koji retracts his Earth Release, revealing summoning marks. Flames burst through, and Jigen tries absorbing them, only to discover he can't. Koji explains these are natural occurring flames he summoned from another location, and as they're not Fire Release, he can't absorb them. Amado stresses they mustn't allow Isshiki to be reborn in Kawaki's body. As long as there are Kāma, the Ōtsutsuki will remain beings who can transcend death. However, he points out it is possible to kill them, and that he'll teach them all how to do it.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Boruto is incredulous that Isshiki would absorb so much fire, and Kawaki explains that he shouldn't be able to, since those are natural flames. Isshiki is combating the flames, but he's shrinking them instead. Amado explains that Sukunahikona can shrink and restore anything but living things, with the exception of the jutsu user, and assures Shikamaru they counted on that happening for them to strike. Jigen's body begins to run out of chakra, so Isshiki can no longer shrink the flames, which begin consuming him. Amado reveals that he was still recovering from the fight against Naruto and Sasuke, which limited how much he could shrink the flames. Naruto wonders if that's Isshiki's end, but Sasuke points out that he still has two Kāma, so he can reincarnate twice. Sasuke also finds it strange, as killing Jigen would make Kawaki Isshiki's sole remaining vessel as he intended. Shikamaru wonders if the entire thing was a setup from the start. Kawaki enters the interrogation room and attacks Amado, but is blocked by Sasuke. Amado assures everyone that it's a misunderstanding, and that he can explain. He says that Jigen's body will perish from the flames in a few minutes, causing the Kāma to automatically begin the reincarnation process, something even Isshiki can't control. He adds that another difference between Jigen and Kawaki is that Jigen's Kāma had time to be fully extracted, so Isshiki can be reincarnated in him, while Kawaki's Kāma has yet to fully decompress, so he can't be a vessel for Isshiki yet. Shikamaru takes it to mean that Isshiki won't be able to return for a while. Boruto asks if Amado intends to kill Kawaki before his Kāma can fully extract, which Amado does confirm is an option, incensing Naruto who refuses to allow it. Amado instructs them to watch the feed so they can witness Isshiki's true form, as even a dead body can be used as a vessel for an Ōtsutsuki. He notes the fortuitousness of Kawaki's presence, wanting to confirm something for himself. Kawaki's Kāma activates and spreads through his body, and suddenly vanishes. Amado has Boruto confirm that the Kāma on Kawaki's hand has vanished as well. The flames consuming Jigen's body all shrink in an instant. Amado reveals that when an Ōtsutsuki reincarnates, all of that Ōtsutsuki's implanted Kāma are erased, something he believes to be a safety feature to avoid the creation of duplicates with the same personality. The others understand that now, without a single implanted Kāma, Isshiki can be permanently killed. Isshiki appears in his true form, and begins shrinking everything in his and Koji's vicinity, including the scout toad, which costs Konoha their video feed. Amado considers his endeavour mostly a success, and that Koji served his function. Naruto gets the feeling Koji was fighting with the intent of fully taking Isshiki out, and is concerned about him for reasons he can't understand. Isshiki says all people have predestined fates, and Koji's mask breaks. He understands that Amado clung to the fate of Jiraiya, which is why he created Koji as his clone, and says his death was also predestined by the same genes.\\n\"},\n",

Isshiki looks for Kawaki with his Byakugan. Via Ino, Shikamaru warns all the shinobi that only Naruto and Sasuke are to engage Isshiki in combat. Naruto leaves to fight Isshiki, and tells Boruto he's also to evacuate. Isshiki questions Konoha shinobi about Kawaki's location, threatening to attack civilians. One of them confesses that they don't have the information. Shikamaru wants to leave, Sai grabs the unconscious Kawaki, and suggests hiding in an old, secret Anbu underground facility. Shikamaru wants Amado to come with them, who expresses concern for Isshiki's Byakugan finding them out. Sai reassures him that the facility is protected against such abilities. Shikamaru thanks Sasuke, and tells Boruto to come along. Sasuke wants to have a word with Boruto first. Isshiki is surprised to find Naruto out of his seal. Sasuke confesses to Boruto that he and Naruto barely made any damage to Jigen before. He explains that Sarada told him what happened during the fight against Boro, and having heard Amado's explanation, Boruto knows it was Momoshiki who defeated him. Sasuke raises the possibility of Boruto's Kāma starting to override him. Boruto is prepared to die fighting, even if it scares him, but he is worried about what he might do if his body is taken over. Naruto refuses to tell Isshiki where Kawaki is, so he puts civilians in danger. The two start fighting. Isshiki kicks Naruto through a couple buildings. Sasuke switches places with Isshiki. Isshiki reminds them how he defeated them before. Sasuke instructs Naruto to cover with shuriken and kunai. They both use them, though Isshiki shrinks them. Sasuke throws his sword, which Isshiki can't shrink, surprising him. The sword transforms back into Boruto, who has his Kāma activated. Sasuke had promised to Boruto to stop him if Momoshiki takes him over, even if he has to kill him, making the promise as his teacher as Naruto probably wouldn't be able to do it. Boruto asked for Sasuke's forehead protector again. Boruto uses his Kāma to create a rift, taking himself and Isshiki away from Konohagakure. Sasuke tracks Boruto's chakra. Isshiki wonders how much of Momoshiki's Kāma Boruto can use. Sasuke and Naruto arrive at their location, where Boruto tells them they can fight all out. They all prepare to fight.\\n\"},\n",

He fights Isshiki using very limited movements. Kurama explains how Baryon Mode consumes their chakra, and how to fight to make it last longer. Isshiki attempts to crush him with his cubes, but Naruto tosses them back at him and goes back to the offensive. Sasuke is impressed that Naruto is overpowering Isshiki. Isshiki sends his rods at him, but Naruto catches them, astonishing Sasuke, who can barely keep track of them with his Sharingan. Isshiki is incensed at how strong Naruto has become. Boruto and Sasuke watch from afar. Isshiki sends a barrage of rods at him, but Naruto dodges them, and uses one of them to deflect others. Naruto goes through a fire blast from Isshiki, landing a Rasengan. He begins to feel the toll of Baryon Mode. In Konoha, Amado asks about Kawaki's prosthetic hand, and is surprised to learn it functions by Naruto sharing his chakra. Kawaki gets concerned feeling Naruto's chakra get weaker. Isshiki realises Naruto's power has life-shortening effects, and thinks Naruto has lost his bet, but begins to cough up blood, confused. Kurama explains to Naruto that while Baryon Mode expends their life force, because all chakra is connected, coming in contact with Isshiki during the fight also drains his, cutting his remaining lifespan down to minutes. While touching Naruto, Isshiki detects the chakra he's sharing with Kawaki, and uses it as an intermediary to pull Kawaki to where they are with a rift. Amado thinks they're done if Isshiki gets his hands on Kawaki. Boruto passes out. Kawaki goads Isshiki, saying he's happy he gets to see him die. Isshiki dismisses it as a long nap. Naruto tells Kawaki to run, and Isshiki stomps him hard enough to get him out of Baryon Mode. He manages to grab Kawaki by the throat, but Sasuke exchanges places with him. Sasuke uses a special smoke bomb, made with a mineral that can occlude abilities such as the Byakugan, preventing Isshiki from finding Kawaki. Isshiki launches a widespread barrage of chakra rods, trying to find Kawaki. Isshiki flies down to Naruto, yelling to Kawaki that if he doesn't give himself up, he'll kill Naruto. Kawaki thinks back to many times he hid and tried to flee from Jigen, and also to his time with Naruto. He shows himself to Isshiki.\\n\"},\n",

Shikamaru, Katasuke, Sumire, Sarada, and Mitsuki greet them. Sarada asks about her father's eye, but doesn't blame Boruto when he claims responsibility. Sasuke agrees with her. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru confer with Amado, to ask about the state of Kara with Isshiki's death. He reveals that the remaining Inner, Code, is dangerous, as a non-functional Vessel who bears a Kāma. Since his Kāma doesn't function as a means of reincarnation, it wasn't erased, but it still functions as a weapon. Amado explains that while he modified other Inners to make them stronger, he instead restrained Code's power, so as not to undermine Jigen's authority, as Code is deeply devoted to the Ōtsutsuki. Code is the only cyborg stronger than Jigen that Amado didn't dispose of under Jigen's orders, and is likely to seek vengeance for Isshiki's death. Code wakes up at the Ten-Tails' pen, having dozed off. His White Kāma activates, manifesting a vision of Isshiki, who deems Code his successor and bequeaths his mission to him.

Naruto also raises his concern of no longer being able to investigate the dimension is search of Kara's Ten-Tails, but believes it won't pose a threat soon, as the enemy no longer has a suitable sacrifice to cultivate a God Tree. They discuss Code's goals and motives, and agree to put the highest priority on finding him. The other Kage express some apprehension on the fact most of the intel they have comes from Amado. Naruto confesses to not fully trusting him, but finds him reliable enough due to his contributions against Isshiki. The Kage ask Naruto what he'll do if Boruto becomes a threat due to his Kāma, and Gaara points out that with Kurama's loss, Naruto might not be strong enough to take down another Ōtsutsuki, so he might need to take action before Boruto gets taken over again.

Boruto can no longer stay awake and falls asleep. Amado approaches Naruto, and offers him a drug he developed to weaken the Byakugan, that might help in preventing Boruto's Ōtsutsuki progression. He explains that he microdosed Kawaki with it for a long time, so Jigen wouldn't notice, which is why Kawaki's progression took longer. Amado also points out that since Boruto has Byakugan potential, he might experience side effects that Kawaki didn't. He admits that he was concerned about Naruto not being able to take action like before, but also reveals he knows what it is like not wanting to lose a child, having had a daughter who died twelve years prior.

Boruto doesn't recall who he is, and Denki explains that his team mostly take on overseas missions. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru congratulate them, and explain they want to promote shinobi with varied skills. The exam is also a way to reassure the village following Isshiki's attack.

Himawari tells Boruto that she's been practising being shinobi with her friends Ehō and Yuina, and they came across some suspicious individuals. Ehō and Yuina kept tracking them, but she was worried about it. Boruto agrees to check it, having time before the finals begin.

Inojin is disoriented by the pillars acting like a maze, and Sai explains to Naruto that Hōki is going all around it memorising its layout. It allows him to strike from blindspots. Hōki recalls Sai explaining that the secretive nature of their missions means they're rarely acknowledged, but that Kakashi was able to become Hokage despite being former Anbu. Inojin decides to fly above the maze, but that allows Hōki to strike him with a pillar. As he falls, Inojin sends some birds Hōki's way as a distraction to allow him to hide. He's concerned by his earlier chakra expenditure. Inojin decides to use his Mind Body Switch Technique. Hōki tries provoking him by suggesting he concede the fight. Inojin doesn't respond, and recalling his previous fights, Hōki knows Inojin will try taking him over. Inojin leaves an ink trail to make Hōki attack him from a known position, and uses his jutsu. Inside Hōki's mind, Inojin is attacked by a construct and is forced out. Hōki holds him at kunai point, and Konohamaru declares him the winner. Renga and Hako celebrate. Chōchō and Shikadai check on Inojin, who wonders what that was. Sai explains it's defensive jutsu against mind-reading, the kind taught to Anbu members in the event they're captured by enemies, to safeguard information. Shikadai and Chōchō comment on how difficult and dangerous those are, and Renga and Hako arrive, saying that dangerous assignments are commonplace for them. Hōki thanks Sai for his training, and helps Inojin up, thanking him for pushing him to give his all. Everyone watching celebrates the good match.

Wasabi isn't as boisterous, which her team-mates notice and comment on. Wasabi's parents arrive, already celebrating her promotion, flustering her. Wasabi's grandmother joins them, expressing pride in Wasabi representing their clan. She believes that Wasabi becoming chūnin at her age, a first for their clan, will be a great accomplishment, Wasabi's parents echoing her and confident that Wasabi can become Hokage. Wasabi's grandmother hands her a scroll she left at home, a jutsu passed down their clan that channels a monster cat. Wasabi points out her match is about to begin, and asks them to return to their seats. Wasabi is exasperated after they leave, thinking that the jutsu is something her grandmother dreamed up. She explains that only a few of her clansmen became chūnin, only after becoming adults themselves, and adds she's never met a jōnin from her clan. Tsubaki is surprised to hear it, but Namida relates to her. Wasabi wants to make her clan proud, but their expectations weight on her. The match begins, Iwabee noticing her low energy, and her finding he can't understand how she feels. Iwabee strikes first, attempting to crush her, but she dodges him, activates her jutsu, and counterattacks. Sarada and Chōchō are joined in the stands by Shinki, Araya, and Yodo, who were told by Gaara to come watch. They confirm they've been chūnin for a while, and comment the Konoha genin are taking their time in doing the same. Shinki notices Kawaki yawning at the stands. Iwabee notices Wasabi's parents cheering on her, which embarrasses her, and she confesses that while she wants to be a great shinobi, becoming Hokage isn't her goal, just something her family assumed and expects of her. That angers Iwabee, who holds the Hokage in the highest regard. Wasabi tells him that for ordinary shinobi like them, becoming Hokage is an unrealistic fantasy. She realises she's yelling and that her family heard her, her mother covering her grandmother's ears. Iwabee notices she dropped a scroll, and she explains the supposed jutsu, though she doubts it's legitimate. She recalls her grandmother telling her about the jutsu, each time aggrandising it. She believes that if such a jutsu existed, she could never use it because of the limits of what she can do. Iwabee agrees with her, find her so afraid of other's expectations she doesn't dare to dream big. He asks if she'll dream big if she sees a cat as big as a mountain, like her grandmother told her, and uses his Earth Release to create one. He tells her she can't do it because she already believes it's impossible. He collapses from using too much chakra, and the head of the cat he created breaks off, threatening to crush him. Wasabi successfully uses her clan's jutsu to destroy the cat head and protect Iwabee. Her family is moved by her use of the jutsu. Konohamaru declares to match over, pointing out Iwabee can no longer stand. Wasabi wants a proper victory, but Iwabee himself says he can no longer fight. Naruto comments on how unusual the match was, and Shikamaru comments it reminds him of Naruto and Kiba. Wasabi's family cries of joy. Boruto and Mitsuki discover where Amado and his captors are. Konohamaru draws the names for the next match, Sarada and Chōchō, both shocked by it.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Naruto and Shikamaru comment with interest on the upcoming match between Sarada and Chōchō. Shikadai finds Inojin sulking. Chōchō finds them and complains about having to fight her best friend. Inojin motivates her by reminding her of their promise. Team 15 checks on Sarada, who is determined to give her all. Kawaki notices Shinki staring at him and leaves. Shinki follows him, telling his team-mates he'll return shortly. Outside the arena, Shinki introduces himself and tells Kawaki he should watch the next match. Kawaki gets angry with being told what to do and grabs Shinki by the collar. Shinki pulls him off with his Iron Sand and reiterates he should watch the match before going back inside. The match between Sarada and Chōchō begins. Chōchō tries landing blows with enlarged fists, while Sarada dodges and reads her movements with her Sharingan. Positioning herself on a wall, Sarada attacks with Lightning Balls, landing hits. She's apologetic about it, which angers Chōchō, who calls Sarada out for not going all out against her and lands a hit. Sarada recalls talking to Sasuke about being committed to taking Boruto out if he became Momoshiki. She gets serious, and attacks with Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, which Chōchō rolls through, pursuing her around. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru comment on how the match has improved. Sasuke watches it from the stands. Sarada prepares a Chidori and Chōchō enters Butterfly Mode. The two clash, and Chōchō goes down first when the smoke clears, so Sarada is declared the winner. Chōchō's team-mates go check on her. Shinki asks Kawaki if he thought the match was worth watching. Sarada and Chōchō do the Seal of Reconciliation. Leaving with Inojin and Shikadai, Chōchō cries about not being able to keep her promise. Inojin tells her not to stress it. Sarada sees Sasuke, and admits that the things shinobi must be prepared to do are more serious than she thought. He asks about Boruto and Mitsuki, who still aren't around. The two watch Amado negotiating with a group about scientific ninja tools. He refuses their terms, considering himself indebted to Konoha. The group decides to take him by force. While Amado prepares to escape by himself, Boruto and Mitsuki engage the enemy and take him. Amado reminds them of the Chūnin Exams, and they try to rush back to Konoha. They notice their names having been drawn yet. At the arena, Denki notes how all other remaining participants are strong opponents.\\n\"},\n",

As they're not present when their names were drawn, Shikamaru recommends not giving them special treatment, so they're disqualified. Wasabi informs Tsubaki she's next. Namida cheers for her as well. Tsubaki is committed to showing the results of her growth. Denki prepares himself, thinking how he and his team-mates have changed since starting at the Academy. Boruto and Mitsuki arrive at the arena, and Sarada angrily informs them they've been disqualified. They realise they would have had to fight each other, and wish they could have done it. Sarada tells them the last match is between Tsubaki and Denki. Denki enters to arena wearing a power suit of his making, confusing many spectators. Naruto is interested in the pitting of samurai against science. Denki's confidence makes an impression in Tsubaki. She makes the first move, but Denki's power suit allows him to quickly analyse her movements and react accordingly. He uses a pseudo Lightning Release they recognise from the previous Chūnin Exam with his suit. Katasuke excitedly explains that Denki's suit uses Lightning Release to stimulate his reflexes. Mitsuki asks if he feels embarrassed considering the previous exam. Iwabee recalls that the person Denki least wanted to fight was Tsubaki, over his limited data on how samurai fight as opposed to shinobi. Still, he remained confident. Denki goes on the offensive, so Tsubaki dodges a heavy blow that surprises everyone. She acknowledges his power, and apologises for underestimating him. Tsubaki recalls overhearing Namida and Wasabi before the exams, how they didn't want her to go back home, but deciding to cheer on her for bringing pride to her people back in the Land of Iron. Tsubaki and some of the spectators notice that Denki's attacks are getting more precise. Denki manages to land hits and throws Tsubaki up in the air, where he aims a fireball at her. She slices through it, and back on the ground, she manages to land an attack made in desperation. Tsubaki wants to test something, and begins attacking Denki not only with her sword, but also her sword's sheath. She's able to destroy Denki's visor. Katasuke explains the visor contained a motion sensor to help Denki predict her movements, which Sarada compares to the Sharingan. The rest of Denki's suit begins to overheat. Tsubaki commends him on what he's achieved so far, but he refuses to give up. He dodges her attack, allowing her to destroy his suit, which surprises her. Denki enhances his movements with the Lightning Release from earlier on his own, and uses the last of his chakra to land an attack on Tsubaki. She is knocked unconscious, and Denki is declared the winner. Denki's father cries overjoyed watching the broadcast. Metal and Iwabee celebrate. Denki's victory inspires Katasuke to create new tools. Konohamaru formally announces the four victors as chūnin as their team-mates cheer on them. Tsubaki wakes up in the infirmary, and confesses to her team-mates she let her guard down when she learned Denki would be her opponent. She also says she didn't consider their feelings, and reveals her intention to request an extension of her stay in Konohagakure. On their way back to Sunagakure, Team Shinki discusses their mission to observe Kawaki, and Shinki admits he wanted to see Boruto's match. The new chūnin celebrate with their friends, team-mates, and families. At home, Naruto asks Kawaki his opinion. He thought everyone was too desperate to win, but thinks it's not too bad to start as a genin. Boruto and Mitsuki decide to have their match by themselves at the arena that night.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Three days before the chūnin promotion ceremony, Sarada examines her new flak jacket, and Sakura comments on how her team dynamics will change now that she's captain and Konohamaru doesn't have to look after them. She gives Boruto and Mitsuki forms to fill, and they discuss how the team is likely to change. Sarada is bothered that Konohamaru won't be part of their team anymore, and they decide to see how he is, wishing to celebrate Sarada's promotion. Coming across Sai and Shikamaru, they discover Konohamaru is on a guard mission with Mirai, escorting a married couple checking on their future home. They're disappointed to learn he won't be back until after Sarada's appointment to team captain. At home, Sasuke and Sakura notice how dejected Sarada is over not having Konohamaru as captain any more. Sasuke comforts her, and advises her how to approach it. Mirai makes her way back to Konoha battered and poisoned. Sakura treats her, and Sai informs Team 7 that she came back alone. Konohamaru is beat up by one of the assailants who captured him and the married couple he was guarding. He recognises their leader as Hyōgo\\u200e, an infamous Kusagakure missing-nin. Hyōgo\\u200e explains he has remained hidden by taking control of the mountain village they're in, finding it better to drive outsiders away than simply hiding. He intends to torture Konohamaru for information. Mirai wakes up and informs Konoha of the situation. Sai and Shikamaru discuss it with Naruto, and find it strange that Mirai and Konohamaru couldn't handle the situation by themselves. They decide to send reinforcements, and Naruto agrees to Team 7's request to go, as their history with Konohamaru should make it easier to coordinate. They hope the mission gives Team 7 closure. Team 7 arrive at the village, and scouting the enemies, wonder why Konohamaru hasn't defeated them. Boruto notices that the villagers seem to be cooperating with the bandits, and Mitsuki wonders if they're all hostages. Konohamaru is questioned about Konoha's sensing system, but divulges nothing. Hyōgo\\u200e changes his approach, and instead of torturing Konohamaru, he tells his men to torture the couple he was guarding. Despite finding it premature, he decides to act, but Boruto arrives transformed as a woman, claiming to be a lost traveller. Hyōgo\\u200e doubts it, as the village is away from everything, so no one arrives there on their way to somewhere else. A thick fog rolls in, and Team 7 begins taking out Hyōgo\\u200e's subordinates. Konohamaru frees himself, and Team 7 informs him they've done all he planned to do using the fog as cover, including freeing the many hostages. Hyōgo\\u200e tries using the fog to cover his escape, but Mitsuki's snake informs him of his direction, so Boruto and Sarada throw Konohamaru, who lands a Rasengan on him. He gets emotional over their last mission together, and they help repair the village before returning to Konoha. Naruto officially appoints the new chūnin as team captains. Team 7 takes a team photo.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto and Himawari both don't want to do it, but Boruto loses at rock-paper-scissors, so he wakes Kawaki up. At the office, Naruto and Shikamaru explain that instead of having to graduate from the Academy, since he's already skilled, they want to see how Kawaki handles himself during missions with teams other than Team 7. Kawaki isn't enthusiastic, and is assigned a D-rank mission with Team 5. He sleeps in the middle of it, creating tension with the team. With the mission over, Kawaki practises ninjutsu. On his way back home, Kawaki refuses playing cards with Inojin and Shikadai. At the Lightning Burger, Boruto's friends recount their attrition with Kawaki, and comment how he might not be suited for being a shinobi. At home, Boruto and Kawaki argue over completing missions and cooperating with team-mates. The next day, Kawaki also causes trouble during a mission with Team 15. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss Kawaki's inability to get along with other teams. They try to assign him to a C-rank escort mission to try getting him more motivated to complete missions. He will fill in for Inojin in Team 10, who is backing up the Sensing Team. This is the final exam for whether Kawaki can become a genin. Kawaki bluntly admits to being unfit for being a shinobi, still having not decided whether he wants to be one or not. After they leave, Shikamaru expresses concern with allowing Kawaki to leave the village for a mission, believing he will be targeted for the Kara technology in his body. Naruto thinks they can't keep him in the village forever, and wants him to make friends who will protect him. Suika Kannonji pays Kawaki his earnings from his completed missions, which he spends in taiyaki. Shikadai, Inojin, and Boruto discuss Kawaki as they play cards. At home, Boruto is concerned about Kawaki's mission. Hinata tells him Kawaki probably struggles with positive interactions after spending so much time as a prisoner, and shows him the taiyaki he bought them. Kawaki finds Sarada training at night, and she explains her motivations. The next day, Kawaki arrives late for his mission, and is berated by their client, Mozuku from the Land of Calm Seas. They depart the village.\\n\"},\n",

The boy refuses to cooperate, so Kurobane tortures him to acquire information, killing him. He learns that Konoha has been involved. Shikadai, Chōchō, and Kawaki guard Mozuku. Mozuku is concerned by Kawaki's lack of interest as Shikadai explains about the Land of Calm Seas. He is exasperated when Kawaki reveals he's not a shinobi yet, and thinks he should have asked for a discount. Mozuku claims the artwork he bought is an old vase requested by his grandmother. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss Kawaki's situation. Konohamaru arrives with intel of a discovery of a boy's corpse, killed with ninjutsu, that matches other five known incidents. Shikamaru tells him to stay on alert. Team 7 is guarding livestock, but the cows suddenly get agitated by Kurobane and Jujumaru, who run near them. Boruto smells blood on the two. They ignore Team 7, and Kurobane confirms their target's direction. While going through a narrow passage on mountain, Kawaki saves Mozuku from falling, and he refuses to let Chōchō carry the vase, deeming it more valuable than his life. They stop to eat by a river. Mozuku and Kawaki bond over coming from less prosperous upbringing. Kurobane and Jujumaru watch them, and wait until night to make a move. They create a mist to obscure their movements, and steal Mozuku's package. The mist clears, revealing Jujumaru controlling a web of blood. Kurobane leaves after saying Mozuku's package is the last, and confirms having killed the others. Mozuku touches one of Jujumaru's blood threads, which forces him to hurt himself. Shikadai knocks him out to stop him. Kawaki destroys the threads with an energy blast, but they regenerate. Shikadai takes a moment to think, and asks Chōchō to go through the threads, destroying many of them. He determined how fast they can regenerate. Jujumaru has Chōchō prepare to attack, but she turns around and attacks him instead, Shikadai having taken control of her with his shadow. He and Kawaki fight Jujumaru while Chōchō gets injured protecting Mozuku. They defeat and restrain him, while Mozuku treats Chōchō. Shikadai tells Mozuku to explain himself. Mozuku reveals there's an epidemic in the Land of Calms Seas, but the daimyō has a monopoly on the treatment, and the high price prevents most citizens from affording it. Mozuku's master is a medical-nin who served the daimyō and developed a more affordable treatment, but was discovered, so he and his students were targeted. He sent his students with money abroad to further develop a cure with colleagues, which is why Mozuku is so frugal with money. The daimyō is trying to acquire their cure to monetise it. Mozuku begs them to recover the medicine, and explains that if he had been upfront about his request, he wouldn't have been able to afford the mission with the little money he has left. Shikadai wants to be back to Konoha for safety, but Kawaki defies him and goes with Mozuku.\\n\"},\n",

He apologises for splitting his team, but Kawaki explains they were never his team. Shikadai takes an injured Chōchō back to Konoha. Konohamaru updates Naruto and Shikamaru that all the recently murdered boys were from the Land of Calm Seas. Believing it to be related, Naruto orders reinforcements, recalling that Team 7 is also out on a mission. Finishing the mission, Mitsuki receives the order, recalling that Boruto's intuition was right. Shikadai stops to let Chōchō rest, and they're approached by Boruto and Sarada, who decided to check on them after seeing the suspicious shinobi around the same area of their mission. Shikadai tells Boruto that Kawaki left with the client. Kawaki and Mozuku catch up to Kurobane. Mozuku tries appealing to him as a Land of Calm Seas citizen, but Kurobane thinks a shinobi should do only as ordered by their employer. He casts a fog from which several clones appear. When Kawaki's attacks go through them, Mozuku believes they might be genjutsu, but is unable to break through it. Kurobane explains the fog is created from ambient moisture, including their own body moisture, which will leave them as dried husks. Kawaki is hit by a real blade, which he has to dodge as he continues to dry up. He determines that since the real sword is moving unnaturally, the real Kurobane must be controlling it nearby. He disperses some of the fog with a Fire Release, revealing blood threads, which he uses to aim an energy blast at the real Kurobane. He dodges it, but is hit by Kawaki, clearing the fog. Kawaki collects the medicine package, but Kurobane recalls his blade with blood threads. Mozuku protects him with his own body, and tells Kawaki he's the only one who can get it back. Kurobane sends his blade at Kawaki again, but Boruto arrives, breaking it with a Rasengan. He attempts to escape, but is stopped by Shikadai. Kawaki pummels Kurobane and checks on Mozuku. He asks Kawaki to deliver the medicine to his nation in his stead, his sensei being in a nearby checkpoint. He gives him his money, his thanks, and dies. Kawaki takes the medicine, Boruto and Shikadai go with him. They come across more pursuers, so the two stay behind to deal with them while Kawaki goes on ahead. Kawaki reaches the checkpoint, and Mozuku's sensei asks about him, recognising the package. An enemy appears and holds a kunai to him, asking for the package. Kawaki hands him the empty box and defeats him, giving its actual contents to Mozuku's sensei. He mourns Mozuku's death and Kawaki informs him Mozuku's body is in the forest. He thanks Kawaki and leaves. Boruto and Shikadai arrive, and three go back to Konoha as it begins to rain. Kawaki blames his disobedience for Mozuku's death, thinking himself unfit for being a shinobi, despite Shikadai pointing out there are always unforeseen circumstances. Kawaki passes out. Back in Konoha, while they can't directly intervene with the Land of Calm Seas daimyō, they can organise aid relief with the medical-nin. Boruto informs Naruto that Kawaki and Chōchō are doing better. Sarada visits Chōchō, and tells her how Kawaki is doing. Boruto and Mitsuki visit him, bringing him a bag full of taiyaki, and are concerned about him after they leave. Kawaki leaves the hospital and runs into Shikadai, who takes him to the Konoha Cemetery. He shows his grandfather's grave, and tells how everyone there died for the village. Shikadai explains that as team-mates, they share the joys, sorrows, pain together, and that as team captain, the mission was his responsibility. They have to move forward because they're alive. Later, Naruto checks on Kawaki, who wants to keep trying at being shinobi no matter how long it takes. Naruto tells him that based on Shikadai's report, despite his issues, he can carry out missions as a genin, so he won't take another exam because he passed. He'll accompany Naruto on missions. He points out that Mozuku gave his life for his country, and asks what is a shinobi exactly. Naruto says he'll have to work out that answer himself. Kawaki is committed to never make the same mistake again and get stronger.\\n\"},\n",

Team 15 visits a merchant who was attacked by bandits in the hospital. He becomes distressed when hearing Tsubaki handle her sword, yelling that samurai are coming after him again. A nurse asks them to leave, and knowing that his assailant was a samurai, they start to investigate where he was attacked. They noticed cut bamboo, which Tsubaki determines was done by a skilled samurai. She recalls Sazanka's skill, and that the rumoured prize of a tournament was the right to claim Mifune's sword Kurosawa when he retires. Sazanka developed his skills to be worthy of wielding it one day. She recognises Sazanka's cut in the bamboo. Later at the Lightning Burger, Wasabi informs them there was another attack while they were investigating. Tsubaki shares her suspicion of who the culprit is. She reveals Sazanka was a genius of the sword, but abandoned the path he was on to pursue only strength, and was caught trying to steal Kurosawa, and killed his fellow disciples to get away. Tsubaki assures them she will have no problem fighting him, and practises at night. The next day, Team 15 lays a trap, attracting the bandits' attention. Most of them get caught, but they hired Sazanka as protection. Tsubaki comments on how he's changed. He says he forgot to kill her. Sazanka draws his sword, and cuts Tsubaki, who hasn't drawn hers. He dodges Namida's attack, and Team 15 retreats. Wasabi treats Tsubaki, asking why she didn't draw her sword. She asks to be dropped from the mission, and reveals she blames herself for why Sazanka turned out the way he did. She won the tournament by chance, and that started to change him to who he is today. Wasabi tells her they might capture him if they ask for reinforcements but warns her that her regret will continue to grow if she doesn't deal with Sazanka herself. Namida and Wasabi point out how she has grown and changed since coming to Konoha, restoring her fighting spirit. Sazanka tells the bandits there's something more important than money he has to do. Team 15 attacks them, Tsubaki going to deal with Sazanka. Sazanka believes that a sword's purpose is to cut, so he has cut many people since the Land of Iron has pursued him and deems that whatever Tsubaki has done since isn't real training. He says he has given up on Kurosawa because he has acquired power, and charges at her. They cross swords, and noticing there are no openings in his attack, she performs her Secret Sword: Snowstorm Beheading. He cuts through it. He recalls when she won against him, and now wants her to admit defeat. She refuses, and refutes his claims against her, saying she has gained strength from the friends who trust her. They cross swords again, and Tsubaki cuts him down. She is saddened by having to do it in these circumstances. Sazanka acknowledges her strength. Later, Wasabi and Namida help her around.

It's a B-rank mission, which Shikamaru explains is due to the likelihood of someone trying to steal the latest model puppets. At the Lightning Burger, Metal Lee and Iwabee wonder what their next mission will be, and complain to Team 7 they never get anything interesting. Denki arrives, and shocks them with news of their mission. They receive mission details from Katasuke, who explains that Dotō Island, previously a fishing village, has discovered gold deposits. However, excavation is dangerous due to soft soil, so they'll be transporting autonomous puppets for the job. Katasuke wants Denki to run adjustment tests before he and other researchers arrive, as most of them are more analysts than maintenance focused. He spends the rest of the day explaining to Denki how the puppets work. Denki asks Katasuke what was the most difficult part of the development process. Katasuke answers that all of it was difficult, as there were several points where he wished to scrap everything and start over, stressing the importance of adapting to changes as they arise. He reveals that he requested Denki's team for this mission because of what he saw during the Chūnin Exams. The next day, Iwabee notices Denki is sleepy before they depart. They take a train and two boats to reach Dotō Island, and hear that many people are coming over since the gold was discovered. As they arrive, Metal and Iwabee notice Denki is nervous, and encourage him. They're received by Ōnami, head of the excavation site. He is rather disappointed by Denki and Team 5, and Denki explains he's been trained in fine-tuning the puppets, and that the developers will join them later. One the trail to the mine's entrance, Denki begins to lag behind, so they stop to rest. Ōnami questions if Denki really is a shinobi, but is unable to even lift the casing he was carrying. They arrive by sunset, and Ōnami explains their two-shift security system. At the mine, Ōnami shows the workers the puppets as Team 5 sets them up. Denki makes a demonstration, impressing the workers. Two of them exchange looks. Ōnami comes around to Denki, and Team 5 finishes setting the puppets up. The two workers get gold they had hidden, and take Ōnami hostage against retaliation. They push Ōnami on top of Metal, and Denki has to stop Iwabee from using Earth Release in the mine, which could cause a collapse. The thieves manage to escape and lock the mine, which will remain closed until the next shift, and shut off the ventilation system. Denki analyses the data he has on the mine, and finds a spot where they can dig with the puppets without causing a collapse. They escape, and use the puppets to locate the gold with the thieves. They find them attempting to escape by boat. One of them attacks with Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique, which Iwabee blocks with Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall. Some of the water hits the puppets, and Iwabee tells to put them away now that they have done their job. Recalling Katasuke's words, Denki adapts the puppets and uses them to catch the thieves' boat, allowing Iwabee to damage its engine. Iwabee and Metal knock the thieves out. The next day, Ōnami thanks Team 5, and apologises for underestimating Denki. The other researchers arrive. Metal is impressed that Denki knew so much about the mines, and he reveals the reason he was so sleepy and nervous before was because he was studying its complex structure on the way. Iwabee believes their mission was a success, but Denki points out that with the researchers present, there's more for them to do.\\n\"},\n",

Katasuke is among several foreign technical experts invited to the opening of their newest power plant. Kawaki is still seasick when they arrive, so they tell him to rest. Sarada recalls Team 5 is also on a mission in the Land of Water, and Katasuke informs them of the details, and that he'll join them after the ceremony. They noticed the increased security, owing to the terrorist threat, and get exasperated by Katasuke constantly getting distracted and slipping away to check on electronic goods. This causes them to be late for the start of the ceremony, where only Katasuke is allowed inside. The orator presents the Shinonome 1 power plant in the ocean, one of 8 facilities built over a decade which can harness sea power for power generation, which the added benefit of pacifying turbulent waters and currents. Among the foreign visitors is the Land of Lightning's daimyō. Boruto splits from the group, looking for Kagura, and discovers protesters against the power plant. A guard informs him that Kagura now reports directly to the Mizukage, but chose to act as a prison warden. At the prison, among the prisoners he oversees are Buntan and Hebiichigo. After his speech, the orator tells his son Awaji he'll inherit it all one day. Chōjūrō announces everyone will be flown to see the Shinonome 1 up close. Boruto rejoins the group, updating them on Kagura. Katasuke allows Boruto to go visit Kagura under the pretence of wanting to inspect it, since they'll have to depart once they're back from the Shinonome 1. Feeling better, Kawaki joins them and tells Boruto to hurry up. At the prison, Boruto is searched before getting inside, and meets up with Kagura. He tells Boruto that some of the swordsmen from their previous encounter are being held in the prison, but Shizuma escaped and killed the previous warden. Hassaku and Ichirōta, who helped him, were caught and moved to a different prison. He trusts that Kyohō, Hebiichigo, and Buntan didn't try to escape, and took over as warden because he believes that to grow Kirigakure, they need to nurture the people. Boruto praises the Land of Water's economic growth, and Kagura explains that some disagree with the daimyō's decisions. Boruto compares the complexity of the situation to his evolving stance on scientific ninja tools. Kagura shows Boruto around, including the highest security cells. Araumi Funato, head of a pirate clan, is suspended off the ground. His clan has plundered the opens seas of the Land of Water for years, and abducted many people. The clan supposedly scattered after Araumi's capture five years prior. Araumi is kept on an glass dome with intense heat, and Kagura warns Boruto that giving him any moisture would be dangerous. Chōjūrō begins organising the departure to the Shinonome 1 by airship. Boruto prepares to head back. The first airship takes off with the wealthy industrialists, but it crashes and explodes. Kawaki protects his group from the shrapnel. Isari watches it from a sea cliff.\\n\"},\n",

Team 7 tends to Katasuke's injuries. At the prison, Kagura tells medical-nin to go to the crash site. Communications to, from, and inside the prison are interrupted. Isari and Funato clansmen break in and immobilise the guards. Kagura is notified of the intruders, and Boruto offers to help, believing it to be connected to the terrorist attack. Jibiki directs water through the prison. Inmates become agitated on account of the explosion. Kagura and Boruto find guards in a Water Prison Technique. Kagura cuts them free, and they inform him the Funato are responsible. Jibiki reports to Isari he found Araumi. Boruto and Kagura analyse the situation. Katasuke asks about Boruto. Chōjūrō receives reports of unidentified bodies in the crashed airship, and orders a lock-down. Misuno asks Chōjūrō to return to his office, where he can ask for reinforcements. Isari arrives at his father Araumi's cell, defeating the guards posted there, and breaks his glass containment. Araumi recovers by absorbing moisture from one of the guards, killing him. Boruto and Kagura intercept them, and fight Isari. Boruto attacks Isari's living weapon with a Rasengan. Kagura protects them with a water mirror. Isari breaks through it with a water wave and leaves. He notices his weapon has taken a liking to Boruto's chakra. The Funato leave with Araumi. Islands throughout the Land of Water begin falling under Funato control. Boruto reunites with Team 7 and informs them the airship crash was a diversion. Chōjūrō receives a report explaining the same. He also learns that a governor's body was found drowned, who had been in contact with the Funato, and speculate that he spread rumours of the terrorist attack. The situation is further destabilised by the destruction of a base in the eastern sea by unidentified weapons. While Misuno and Kagura update each other, Boruto is concerned about Team 5, whose mission is one an island of the eastern sea. Chōjūrō can't spare the extra manpower, but allows Kagura to go help Team 7. He explains the situation, and hands him Hiramekarei. Team 7 procures a still functioning boat. Kagura arrives, having recruited Buntan, Kyohō, and Hebiichigo for the mission, who were also allowed to use their swords again, much to Team 7's surprise. They complain to Kagura, but he counters they were allowed to move around under his supervision. They depart to Dotō Island, Kawaki complaining about being on a boat again.\\n\"},\n",

Kagura can tell they're about to enter hostile waters by listening to the sea birds in the air. The shinobi hide as the boat is boarded by Funato clansmen. Taiki manages to bribe them, but Kawaki exposes them by getting out in the open, feeling so sick he needed fresh air. They throw the Funato clansmen into the water, and Taiki speeds up the boat to flee from them, but only for a short while, so the engine doesn't die. Kawaki apologises for exposing them, and tensions rise between Team 7 and the swordsmen. Mitsuki advocates against causing a ruckus in such a small boat. Kagura assures Team 7 the swordsmen can't betray them, and shows the cursed seals on their necks. Buntan assures Sarada they're taking this mission seriously as a way to shorten their sentences, and if they wanted to do anything, it wouldn't be in front of Kagura. They come across a destroyed island where villagers stood up to the Funato. Kagura explains how the Funato's influence grew when Araumi took over leadership of the clan, and targeted trade routes between the Land of Water and other nations, depriving them of wealth. Five years prior, Araumi was captured in an operation which Chōjūrō himself took part in, so without its leader, the Funato's influence receded. Boruto thinks they're scum, but Kawaki points out even scum has reasons for what they do. Dotō Island comes into view. The Funato clansmen on the island control the people. Boruto wants to find Team 5, but Kagura agrees that Sarada and Mitsuki would be better scouts, with the Sharingan and snakes. Sarada wants Boruto to stay on the boat, watching the swordsmen. Kawaki reminds them that Konoha researchers are also in the island, so they'll need another boat. They arrange to meet before the full moon. Sarada and Mitsuki infiltrate the island, and witness hostages carrying sacks from the mine. Mitsuki spies them through his snakes, and learns they report to Tenma and are transporting gold from the mines. They want to join up with Team 5 before trying to save the villagers. Metal Lee rejoins Denki and Iwabee after setting up traps, and they discuss their situation. They're outnumbered by Funato, who have also confiscated the mining puppets. Sarada and Mitsuki learn that Team 5 hasn't been captured when a couple Funato fiddle with one of the puppets. They ambush the clansmen transporting a puppet, looking for clues about Team 5. The puppet fights them, its settings having been messed with by the Funato's fiddling. It escapes, and Sarada notices it was going after the gold on the Funato clansmen. They use it as bait in a trap and manage to reset the puppet. It leads them to Team 5, Denki still having the puppets' controller. They inform Sarada and Mitsuki the researchers have been captured. In Taiki's boat, the swordsmen antagonise Boruto, suggesting his team-mates have been eaten by sharks. Kagura reveals to Boruto the reason he's trusting the swordsmen is because he helped him when Shizuma had lead him astray. He wants to save them, like Boruto saved him. Kagura explains those three had to opportunity to escape with Shizuma, but didn't, and won't explain why. Boruto appreciates Kagura's intentions, but can't bring himself to trust them.

Kagura thinks it's a fortress, and deduces it was built using technology stolen from Kirigakure, as the Funato have never had this kind of firepower. He wants Boruto, Kawaki, and Buntan to investigate while the others wait to rendezvous with Sarada and Mitsuki. Team 5 shows Mitsuki and Sarada how the Funato have organised at Dotō Island, and where they're holding the islanders hostage. They decide that Team 5 will steal a Funato transport ship that can carry all the islanders, as Denki is the most likely to figure out how to pilot it, while Sarada and Mitsuki will try to smuggle the hostages out without being noticed. Boruto and Buntan butt heads while approaching the Funato fortress. He has Kawaki throw him at the fortress, and uses Kawaki's blast and his own Wind Release: Gale Palm to propel himself, landing in the fortress. He throws a rope, allowing Buntan and Kawaki to board. Team 5 discusses if the riskier situation around their mission is lucky or unlucky. One of the Funato leaders receives word they found where the Konoha shinobi were hiding, and promises a gold nugget to whoever can find them. The hostages discuss whether it's better to die where they are, or to be forced becoming a Funato soldier. At the fortress, Tenma Funato kills a newbie in a traditional death match to join his unit. He is notified of Araumi's breakout and celebrates. He wants to join his father and brother, but abides to the order to gather gold, and is offended by the suggestion he could become the successor of the clan over Araumi and Isari. Buntan explains who Tenma is to Boruto and Kawaki as they watch him. One of the hostages informs the Funato that beyond the shinobi who escaped, there are other Konoha citizens among the hostages, in hopes of securing his freedom. The Funato leader concludes the shinobi will try to rescue their allies. Sarada and Mitsuki take out the soldiers on guard duty, and get into the mines. They take out the Funato watching the hostages, and direct them to the harbour, where Team 5 is securing a ship for their escape. The Funato intercept their escape, binding the Konoha citizens with Water Release. Sarada and Mitsuki pretend to surrender, but knock the Funato out with genjutsu and snakes, and hurry the hostages before the main Funato unit notices them. Denki takes out the Funato in the ship with a smoke-flash bomb, but struggles to hotwire the ship. The Funato leader signals the main force to join him. The Konoha shinobi prevent the Funato from getting on the ship. Denki manages to get the ship working with his Lightning Release. Metal Lee and Iwabee celebrate. Buntan takes out a guard as they move around, drawing censure from Boruto. Kawaki remains queasy from seasickness, so Buntan cures it to prevent it from affecting the mission. Kawaki relates to her kill or be killed attitude. They discover the fortress' giant scientific ninja tool weapon. Denki steers the stolen ship.

Boruto wants to inform Kagura, certain the fortress should have a way to make contact. Iwabee informs the others there are no ships pursuing them and the freed hostages. Sarada radios Kagura of their rescue of the hostages, telling him they should arrive at the rendezvous as planned. He in turn reveals the existence of the mobile fortress, and that he sent Boruto and two others to investigate. Boruto manages to contact Kagura, and they update each other. He reveals the fortress is moving toward the rendezvous point, and that if Sarada's ship is spotted, it'll be obliterated by the fortress' scientific ninja tool. They're finding difficult to do much with so many Funato aboard. The Funato boat they came across earlier catches up with Kagura's boat, ramming through it. Boruto decides they have to destroy the fortress' weapon themselves. Kagura wants to use Taiki's damaged boat as a distraction to help Boruto. Taiki's boat collides with the fortress, and the Funato are ordered to check on it, giving Boruto and the others a chance to get closer to the weapon. They're spotted by two guards. Buntan takes one out with a Lightning Ball, but the other escapes to call reinforcements. They wonder how to destroy such a big weapon, and Kawaki suggests destroying the door to buy themselves time. Kagura arrives with Hebiichigo and Kyohō, having defeated the remaining guard, Hebiichigo sewing the door shut behind them. Buntan thought Kagura would only order them around instead of taking part of the action. Kagura informs them they've lost Taiki's boat, and can no longer contact Sarada and Mitsuki. Before they can decide on how to attack the weapon, Tenma arrives, and is disappoint to see only children. Hebiichigo attacks, but Tenma summons a fiddler crab pincer and counterattacks. The sight of Hebiichigo's blood triggers Kyohō into a rage, and he begins pressuring Tenma. His attacks with Kabutowari destabilise the fortress' structure, drawing Boruto's attention to a way they can get on top of the weapon. Kyohō also attacks Boruto and Kawaki, Buntan warning them of Kyohō's rage. Tenma uses the opportunity to attack them as well. Kagura knocks Kyohō out and takes up the fight with Tenma, Hebiichigo looking after Kyohō. Tenma is notified of a ship that contacted them from Dotō Island, and figuring it's Boruto's allies, orders to get on firing range. Kagura fights Tenma, and protects Buntan when Tenma shifts his focus to her. Kawaki joins Kagura against Tenma. Boruto reaches the chakra cannon, just as it takes aim at the ship and begins charging up. Iwabee spots the fortress aiming at them in time for Denki to change course and dodge the shot. Tenma is informed they missed, and orders to fire it again. Buntan holds off the guards while Boruto uses a maintenance crane to drag the cannon around as it fires, damaging the fortress. Kawaki and Kagura hold Tenma down and prevent him from stopping the shot in time. The fortress begins to collapse, so Boruto, Kagura, and the others escape. Tenma vows to kill them. At the ship, Team 5, Sarada, and Mitsuki are relieved. They all join up at the ship and thank each other. Team 5 is surprised by the presence of the swordsmen. who celebrate reduced sentences with the mission's success.

Iwabee expresses distrust of the New Seven Ninja Swordsmen, Kyohō in particular, over the blind rage he went through at the Funato fortress. Boruto points out how calm he is now, and adds that Buntan helped them in tough spots, so he'll trust Kagura's judgement. Taiki stresses he wants to be well compensated for having to sacrifice his boat, wishing for enough money to build a new one. That night, Taiki is murdered while everyone sleeps, and Kagura discovers the body in the morning. Iwabee raises the possibility there's a Funato among the refugees on the ship. Mitsuki determines the murder weapon was very heavy, and Kawaki asks about Kyohō's whereabouts. They find Kyohō cleaning blood off Kabutowari, and he claims he slept through the night. Kawaki points out he had no memory of going on a rampage in the fortress, and Iwabee believes that's what happened again. Kyohō and Iwabee become hostile to each other, but Hebiichigo separates them with wires, and assures Kyohō was in deep sleep because of his rampage at the fortress. Iwabee questions if she's not Kyohō's accomplice. Boruto talks Iwabee down, pointing out how distressed Kyohō is, and Buntan talks Hebiichigo down, reasoning that she shouldn't provoke Iwabee is she wants him to stand down. They decide to keep quiet about Taiki's murder, and wonder about the culprit. Hebiichigo suggests they already escaped the ship, but Denki says that with the thick fog, even the Funato wouldn't risk it without a ship, which they would have heard. They decide to investigate the ship for a hidden culprit, while Iwabee and Boruto keep an eye on Kyohō, Boruto feeling guilty that Taiki got involved despite being a bystander. Everyone else splits in teams of two. Word of Taiki's murder spreads through the refugees, who become concerned by the presence of the swordsmen on the ship. Metal Lee asks Hebiichigo if she believes in Kyohō's innocence. She doesn't want to be guilty by association and lose her sentence reduction. She also believes him because they did time together. Metal is convinced, his trusting nature confusing Hebiichigo. Boruto thinks Iwabee doesn't really believe Kyohō is guilty, and recalls that Iwabee's grandfather died fighting Kirigakure. Iwabee is surprised Boruto remembers it. Boruto thinks they should trust Kyohō and the swordsmen because Kagura trusts them. The shinobi find no sign of a hidden culprit, but Denki brings one of the refugees, who wishes to speak with them. They go to Boruto, Iwabee, and Kyohō, telling them a refugee came forward with damning testimony, and they ask for Kyohō to unmask himself. The refugee claims he saw Kyohō on his way to the captains quarters when he went to the bathroom. They want to see if Kyohō has the same face marks as the Funato. Kyohō is very anxious about unmasking. Even his team-mates have never seen Kyohō unmasked. The refugees recall Kyohō of being surrounded by the Funato, causing him to run in fear, which they take as proof of Kyohō's guilt. Kawaki tells Boruto it's a drastic measure they have to take. Kyohō ambushes Iwabee, but is saved by Kawaki, who prepares to execute Kyohō. Kawaki tells the refugees he dealt with Kyohō, and the shinobi deal with Kyohō's body. As the night rolls in, so does thick fog again. One of the refugees checks on Kyohō's body, puking a lot of water, which reforms into Kobanza, who stole Kabutowari while Kyohō was sleeping. He intends to take control of Kyohō's body. Kyohō reveals himself to be alive, catching the Funato in Kawaki's trap. Kawaki thought that news of Taiki's murder spread too quickly, and the fake testimony sealed the deal, as the bathroom and captain quarters are in opposite directions. Kobanza turns into water again, which Mitsuki compares to Suigetsu. He and Boruto attack with Lightning Release kunai, forcing him to escape through cracks on the wall. He tries to take out the engine, but Hebiichigo holds him in place with Nuibari, its wires capable of binding chakra itself, so the Funato clansmen can't escape even with a liquid body. Boruto, Kagura, and Buntan catch up, Buntan ready to make him talk. The clansmen forces himself free of the wires, and goes into the engine, killing himself to damage it. Kyohō protects Hebiichigo from the explosion. The next day, the refugees feel bad about distrusting Kyohō. Metal wonders why Kyohō wears a mask, and he explains that long ago, his village was burned by the Funato, so he wears a mask to hide the scars, the sight of blood taking him back to that moment. Iwabee apologises for suspecting Kyohō, who in turn apologises for taking so long to explain himself. Mitsuki takes an interest on Kawaki.

Another ship approaches them, the boy on the ship reminding Boruto of the figure he saw. Boruto asks the boy if he's the one who dove after him. The boy is flustered, and the other man tells him the boy was with him the whole time. Boruto remains certain he fell in the ocean, despite everyone else saying otherwise. Kagura recognises the man as Kajiki, a prominent shipbuilder from an island north of Kirigakure. The boy boasts Kajiki is the best shipbuilder in the whole Land of Water, and is reprimanded by Kajiki. The boy introduces himself as Ikada, Kajiki's apprentice, and notes most of them are Konoha shinobi. Kagura explains their situation, and deciding he can't fix the ship there, Kajiki has Ikada prepare for their ship to tow the damaged one. They reach the shipbuilders' island, and Ikada offers to show them around. Boruto recalls that whoever saved him had webbed hands, but Ikada shows his aren't, so Boruto apologises.

Kagura manages to contact Misuno, who reports that Chōjūrō left for the front-lines, and suspects he'll order Kagura to do the same soon. Misuno is leaving to join Chōjūrō. Buntan complains about their situation. Kawaki is bothered by Mitsuki following him. Kajiki chides Ikada for letting an important engine part to go out of stock, and is unwilling to let him go get more because of Funato activity. Boruto offers to guard Funato while he retrieves the missing part. Kajiki allows it, so Ikada and Boruto depart on a small ship made by Ikada.

He explains that he came to the shipbuilders' island on his own, just wishing to do something with boats, until he met Kajiki and decided to become his apprentice. Boruto asks if this means he's living away from his family, and apologises for inquiring too much. Ikada says a lot happened when he left, and he only stayed in contact with his older sister, who was the only one who supported his decision. Boruto mentions Himawari, and the two bond over how scary angry sisters can be.

On rough waters, Boruto spots a capsized boat, wanting to help. Ikada is against it, not wanting to risk their lives, but relents when Boruto points out there's someone on the boat. Ikada reads the waves and the wind to avoid whirlpools, but they lose sight of the person on the boat. Boruto prepares to dive after them, but Ikada goes instead. Boruto notices webs on his hands as he swims. Ikada saves the man, and Boruto asks about his webs. Ikada confesses the webs appear whenever he puts effort in swimming, confirming he's the one who saved Boruto. He keeps them hidden so as not to startle strangers. Boruto doesn't find them that odd, knowing many peculiar persons himself. Ikada says no one else knows about it, and asks Boruto to keep it a secret, which he agrees.

In the morning, Seiren disguises herself and visits Ikada. She wants him to go back, but he claims there's nothing he can do. She refutes it by saying he has the power everyone in the Funato clan possesses. They think back to when their father held a ceremony to determine Ikada's powers. Ikada was scared, and Tenma thought little of him. Araumi threw Ikada at the stormy sea, and the sea threw him back on land. Seiren says he displayed more power than anyone in their clan, and that Araumi acknowledged him.

Hebiichigo spots Seiren's ship approaching.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"The Kirigakure and Funato fleets battle at sea. Isari and Jibiki discuss how they're luring Kirigakure into a trap. Boruto and Iwabee join Kagura, Sarada, and Denki, who are going over the coded message they discovered. Iwabee's comment on origami gives Kagura an idea on how to fold the paper, allowing him to decode the message. Everyone gathers, and Kagura explains the sea battle is a distraction, while an elite Funato force makes a sneak attack on Kirigakure, even making their way there by land instead of sea to avoid drawing attention. Even if Chōjūrō turns back now, he won't make it back in time to protect the skeleton crew on Kirigakure. Boruto wants them to go to Kirigakure, but Kagura is unwilling to allow it, as this is a war, and they no longer have the pretext of getting Team 5 and the Konoha researchers to safety. Sarada agrees with Boruto. Kagura asks for the swordsmen's help, but unsatisfied with just a three year sentence reduction for what they've done so far, they ask for a complete acquittal, which Kagura agrees to, intending to negotiate it with Chōjūrō personally. As the elite Funato force is making their way through mountainous terrain, Kagura knows a village they'll have to pass through, and plans to intercept them there. They arrange for the refugees to be evacuated, and coordinate messages warning Chōjūrō about the sneak attack, and Naruto about the developments from their mission. Boruto goes to the dock to check on Ikada, but Kajiki tells him he hasn't seen Ikada since the night before. He doesn't believe that Ikada was kidnapped, and knows he wouldn't abandon his shipbuilding training. Boruto checks Ikada's home, and finds out he even left his idea journal behind. Kagura's group arrives at the village, where two villagers recognise him, as that's where he grew up. He explains the situation to the village, and asks them help in fortifying it to protect themselves from the Funato when they pass through. Sarada and Buntan make note of a ravine and bridges they saw on the way to the village, and want to force the Funato into the ravine by taking down the bridges. Kagura has Team 7, Buntan, and Kyohō fortify the village's defences, while Team 5 and Hebiichigo destroy the bridges. The small children in the village take a liking to Kawaki. Metal Lee gets embarrassed when his suit rips while destroying a bridge, exposing his underwear. Hebiichigo sews it, and shares her concerns about facing the Funato. Metal's positive attitude puzzles her. Boruto updates Kagura on the fortification's progress, and asks him about his past. Kagura explains that because of the stigma of being Yagura's grandson, they couldn't guarantee his safety in Kirigakure, so they moved him to this village. Boruto is appalled by it. Kagura has good memories of making friends beneath the tree where he practised kenjutsu, despite them knowing who he was. Kagura's old friends also befriend Kyohō as he chops down trees for fortifications. Kagura confides his hopes for the village to Boruto. The Funato make their way through the mountains. Funamushi is concerned about Seiren. Hebiichigo is confused by Kagura's continued trust in her despite her attempt to kill him. At night, Boruto feels ready to face the Funato.\\n\"},\n",

She hears Buntan and Kyohō calling out to her, knowing the route she'd have taken. Buntan is annoyed at the moment she chose to defect, Kyohō knows she feels lonely because they didn't go with her. At the ravine, Kagura's group discusses the swordsmen's absence. As their traps are finalised, Kagura has Team 5 return to protect the village, while he and Team 7 deal with the Funato in the ravine. Metal Lee is saddened by Hebiichigo's betrayal. A Funato scout spots them. Hebiichigo tears her clothes on a branch, and pricks her finger with a needle while mending it. She overhears the Funato scouts talking about discovering Kagura's ambush and Funamushi's plan to counter it. She feels conflicted between staying on her way, or returning to warn them about it and risk getting involved in the battle. The Funato forces arrive at the ravine, but their scouts trigger traps early, wasting them. The Funato attack Kagura and Team 7. Funamushi receives the report about it, and commands his forces to advance while their enemies are distracted. Hebiichigo arrives just in time to protect Kagura from an attack, having informed Buntan and Kyohō, who arrive with her. Kagura decides they have to defeat Funamushi and retreat while the Funato are disoriented by it. Funamushi grows impatient at how long his forces are taking to advance, and joins the battle himself, becoming elated when he notices Kagura, seeing it as an opportunity for payback over Seiren's defeat. He attacks them with a large scale Water Release, creating and controlling a waterspout. The attack is blocked by a landslide caused by Team 5, who was notified of the emergency by a snake sent by Mitsuki. Hebiichigo is embarrassed when Metal is happy about her return. With the ravine passage blocked, they'll have to face the Funato at the village. A Funato advises Funamushi not to pursue them, as they'll have the advantage at the village with fortified defences, but Funamushi wants to avenge Seiren. At the village, Kagura's group seals every water source so Funamushi can't use his jutsu. Iwana and Yamame offer to help evacuate the villagers. The Funato arrive at the village and attack. Buntan and Sarada attack with Lightning Release, Iwabee creates earth walls for Kyohō to hammer at the Funato. Hebiichigo creates wire footing for Metal to stand above the Funato and attack. Disappointed with his soldiers' performance, Funamushi takes two of them and drains the water of their blood for his jutsu, having learned it from Araumi. He believes it's worth it to avenge Seiren, who he claims will never stand again. The other Funato imprison Kyohō, Metal, and Iwabee with water, putting them on the way of Funamushi's attack, which destroys parts of the village. Kagura channels his chakra into Hiramekarei, enlarging it enough to cut through Funamushi's attack. Having separated himself from it at the last second, Funamushi holds a weakened Kagura hostage, forcing everyone else to drop their weapons. He still stabs Kagura through the chest with a water spike.\\n\"},\n",

Enraged, Boruto activates his Kāma and lands a Rasengan on Funamushi before joining the others in checking on Kagura. Gokai commands the Funato to retreat, Funamushi too injured to keep fighting despite wishing to avenge Seiren. Hebiichigo closes Kagura's wound, and Sarada and Iwabee try healing him. Mitsuki notes the difficulty of providing medical care in such an isolated village. Kagura asks them to protect the village, and hands Hebiichigo his petition for having the swordsmen released. He thanks Buntan for sticking with him, and asks Kyohō to protect them. He gives his final words to Boruto, and dies. Misuno and Chōjūrō confirm Kagura's intel that the Funato at sea are stalling for time. Isari wants to keep stalling, but Tenma wishes to fight, admitting he's not smart like Isari, wishing Araumi to recognise him for his strength. He thinks back to being adopted by Araumi after his parents abandoned him, aiming to be strong like Araumi. They receive a message from Funamushi's group about Seiren being injured while trying to get Ikada. Tenma wants to fight, but Isari stresses they must reformulate the plan. Kagura is buried at the village's tree. At night, Boruto and Kawaki want to strike back, but Sarada says they must have a plan. Buntan argues that following Kagura's orders brought them far, so they need to pick a new leader, and they agree it should be Sarada. Boruto thinks back to his history with Kagura. Team 7 asks him about the Kāma activating earlier. He explains that while Amado's drugs have halted its extraction, the process can't be undone, so he can draw on its power without Momoshiki taking over. Jibiki informs Isari that Tenma's boat is gone. He tries to infiltrate Kirigakure's ships with his unit, but is discovered. He fights Chōjūrō with his weapon and Water Release, but Chōjūrō and the Kiri-nin overpower them until only Tenma remains. Chōjūrō kills him and he falls into the sea, wishing Araumi had praised him.

Gokai points out that while possible, this might make ambushing Kirigakure harder later on. At the village, everyone tries making repairs while still mourning for Kagura. Iwabee reports that the food storage was destroyed, so there's very little food left. Sarada weights their options. Denki suggests foraging for food on the chance Funamushi avoids the village to continue with the Kirigakure ambush, which would allow them to know if the Funato pass them by, and return quickly if necessary. Sarada agrees to let Team 5 do it. Mitsuki volunteers for locating the Funato, being able to use his snakes to cover a large area. Sarada wants everyone else to help fortify the village for the next attack. Boruto, Kawaki, and the swordsmen want to counterattack the Funato, but Sarada stresses that if they go looking for them, the village will be defenceless if the Funato show up, which would also allow them to carry on with their Kirigakure ambush. She wants them to follow her orders so that no one else dies, as Kagura's wish was to protect the village. Isari informs his father of Tenma's death. Araumi asks for the circumstances and notes how composed Isari is. Isari confesses to feeling bitter and frustrated, but the situation requires him to stay steady, and notes that with the failed diversion, their ambush is more likely to fail as well. Araumi comments that Tenma's death and Seiren's defeat are consequences of his plan as well. He is confident that Seiren will recover, and wants her to head their assault unit so she can get revenge on the ones who defeated her, certain it's the ones they fought at the prison. Isari wants to carry on with the ambush, but Araumi decides to take leadership, even if it means ignoring Isari's plans. Isari wanted to go with ambushes because he's aware of the difference in strength between the Funato and Kirigakure, but Araumi states that as a clan of the sea, that is unlike them, so they'll fight head on. Araumi sends word to call off Funamushi's ambush, and considers it a mistake leaving Isari in charge as recognition for his role in freeing him from prison. Team 5's foraging doesn't amount to much, and with trading diminished because of the conflict, the village has to ration food. Kawaki informs them the villagers are foregoing eating for their sake, who feel the village will collapse entirely without them. Hebiichigo gives her food to children, and everyone else agrees not to eat as well. Metal Lee follows Hebiichigo, and she reveals she never had a family, sharing memories of growing up in a trash heap. She became a shinobi when she killed a missing-nin who tried killing her for spotting him. The shinobi who were pursuing him saw she had a talent for killing people and praised her, something no one had done before. Metal says there's more to her than that, pointing out her skill in sewing. Sarada settles on a plan to hunker down. Mitsuki reports no Funato sightings, and wishes Kagura could see the swordsmen now. The children tell Kawaki that beyond the mountains, there are fruit-bearing trees. Kawaki wishes to go there, but Iwabee says he and Denki should go, admitting that as a strong fighter, Kawaki should stay in the village in case the Funato attack. The children guide Denki and Iwabee through the forest. Boruto and Kawaki reaffirm their conviction of getting Funamushi at Kagura's grave. Denki, Iwabee, and the children reach the fruit trees, but are overwhelmed by the Funato also getting food. Gokai delivers Araumi's orders to Funamushi, informing him of no changes to Seiren's condition and aborting his ambush.

The children rush back without Denki and Iwabee, and inform everyone that they were captured by the Funato. Buntan and Kawaki believe they're either dead or will be soon, recalling Kagura, but Metal is steadfast in believing they're ok, urging everyone to prepare to fight the Funato. Mitsuki spots Funamushi's unit, with fewer people in it, but no sign of Denki and Iwabee. They have the villagers hide again, Yamame and Iwana understanding it, and asking Boruto to avenge Kagura. Sarada takes note of the Funato positions. Buntan advises her not to be so tense before battle. Sarada stresses that as captain, it's her responsibility that no one dies. Metal is more nervous than usual, as winning this fight is necessary to see his team-mates again. Hebiichigo thinks back to Kagura, and shares that the reason she has survived so many battles is because during them, she fought thinking only of herself. At sundown, the Funato still haven't attacked. Kawaki wonders if they're trying to starve them out after learning their situation from Denki and Iwabee searching for food. Boruto doesn't think that's the case, recalling that Funamushi went straight for Kagura because he was avenging Seiren, and believes Funamushi is waiting for something. Buntan asks what they'll do about his Water Release. Boruto found the jutsu familiar, and asks Mitsuki about it. At night, Funamushi smells the tide in the wind, and decides to attack in the morning. Gokai points out their dwindled numbers, and Funamushi's still healing body. Funamushi wants to attack soon before Araumi forces their withdrawal, as he won't have another chance to avenge Seiren. The Funato begin to mobilise, and Sarada orders the swordsmen and Metal to engage them. Sarada is leaving Funamushi to Boruto and Kawaki, since Boruto is his main target. Despite their diminished numbers, the remaining Funato are fighting harder, even sacrificing themselves to hold them in place for attacks. Funamushi arrives and attacks. Kawaki protects Boruto. Funamushi taunts Boruto, claiming Denki and Iwabee died begging for their lives. Boruto notices the Funato bringing Funamushi water barrels for his jutsu, which confirms his suspicion. He attacks Funamushi with Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow, having confirmed with Mitsuki that Suigetsu's similar jutsu also makes him vulnerable to Lightning Release, and that it's meant to be used in areas with unlimited water. If he times his attacks right, Funamushi can no longer use his Water Release. Kawaki notices Funamushi is still waiting for something, and it begins to rain, which allows to create a giant water jellyfish. With it, Funamushi beings attacking indiscriminately, even his own men in an attempt to avenge Seiren. Aware of the damage already inflicted on Funamushi, Boruto believes he can win by landing a Rasengan in close range. Hebiichigo confirms that Boruto needs Funamushi to stay still for a moment. The rest of Team 7 draw Funamushi's attention, moving out of the way of his attacks. Hebiichigo is able to stop him, but something so big is hard to hold in place for long. Metal protects Hebiichigo while she holds Funamushi still. Some of the tentacles still prevent Boruto from getting close. Sarada, Mitsuki, and Buntan attack with Lightning Release from a distance. Funamushi breaks free and lands a hit on Hebiichigo. He also manages to swipe at Kawaki, and Boruto. Despite this, Boruto moves through the jellyfish, and lands his Rasengan. Funamushi manages to hold Boruto like he did Kagura, but Buntan stabs him, avenging Kagura. The Funato retreat. Hebiichigo dies from her injuries, thanking Metal for showing her possibilities other than fighting. She is buried besides Kagura. They mourn her, and the villagers begin to rebuild.\\n\"},\n",

They're concerned about Iwabee and Denki, but Metal is still searching for them with Team 7's assistance. They find an injured Funato soldier, and take him back to the village, where Sarada heals him. Buntan disapproves, giving his allegiance to Funamushi, who killed Kagura. Other villagers share the sentiment, despite Sarada pointing out he might have information on Denki and Iwabee. Boruto says that Kagura has been avenged, and Buntan questions the cost of that. Kawaki says casualties are part of war, and Buntan counters that Araumi is still alive, so they have to join up with Kirigakure's forces. She's doubtful of what advantage keeping Denki and Iwabee alive would give Funamushi, and if they were, they'd have been used as bargaining chips already. Sarada asks for one more day on the village, which Buntan agrees to. Sarada checks on Boruto at Kagura's grave, where he admits he thought that avenging him would make him feel better, but it didn't. Sarada takes responsibility for Hebiichigo's death as captain. They agree that Kagura would be glad they saved the village, and commit themselves to finding Denki and Iwabee, and bringing them home. The next day, Yamame and Iwana invite Kyohō to stay on the village, something no one has ever asked him. By their graves, Buntan tells Kagura and Hebiichigo that thanks to his petition, they have been pardoned. Denki and Iwabee show up just as Metal's faith in them being alive begins to waver. Back at the village, they eat, and explain what happened while they were captive. One of Funamushi's subordinates wanted to kill them, but upon learning they were gathering food for children, Funamushi merely had them tied up. When the Funato fled after hearing of Funamushi's defeat, they used the opportunity to escape, Iwabee cutting through their restraints with an Earth Release. They share their theories on why Funamushi didn't kill them or used them in negotiations, which Boruto finds hard to believe. Sarada wants them all to sleep early so they can leave early in the morning, but Boruto goes scouting. Kyohō tells Iwana and Yamame he can't stay because he has to help Buntan. While keeping watch at night, Boruto is attacked by Gokai, who lures him into a trap where someone else tries hitting him with blow-darts. Boruto defeats Gokai, sending him through an alarm system to alert his friends. He discovers his other assailant is Kobuna, who is there to avenge his father, Funamushi. His words remind Boruto of his own, and Buntan's, giving him pause. Sarada arrives in time to protect him, Gokai and Kobuna retreating. He tells Sarada who Kobuna is. Kawaki clashes with Boruto over him understanding Kobuna's feelings. Mitsuki is impressed that Kawaki is always able to convey his feelings and clash with people, admitting his own difficulty in doing so. Kawaki says Mitsuki must also have a way, one that isn't aggressive like Kawaki's, as he has known Boruto for a long while. When they arrive, everyone else is prepared to question the captured Funato soldier. Boruto tells them about Kobuna, and they argue over the cycle of vengeance. If they stop fighting, the situation with the Funato won't be resolved, but if they continue, they'll breed more resentment. The captured Funato soldier laughs at Boruto, saying he's already been an enemy of the Funato since long before Funamushi because he injured Seiren, whose younger brother is Ikada, to everyone's shock.\\n\"},\n",

Ikada finds them beautiful, thinking it must have taken time to gather them. Kobuna boasts being able stay underwater for three minutes, and asks about Ikada's ship drawing, which he claims is nothing important. Ikada orders a guard to keep watch when Kobuna takes him outside, showing off his progress with the blowpipe. Kobuna confesses his mother asked him to check on Ikada, get him out from time to time. He says that with it, he can fight Kirigakure, and that his father would teach him to fight after returning from his mission. They watch everyone who lives with them working on the ships and training, each one pulling their weight. Kobuna asks if Ikada won't fight, and he says he's not good at it. Kobuna thinks he just has to train like him, but Ikada points out his lack of gills, unlike his siblings. Kobuna finds him amazing nonetheless, and Ikada mentions someone else saying the same. Araumi and Isari arrive, Araumi complaining about how much time Ikada spends taking care of Seiren, which won't change anything for him. Ikada pulls away, telling his father not to decide what he needs to do. He goes to help the women repairing the ships. One asks about Seiren, another whose husband was killed by Kirigakure asks if Ikada will fight. Jibiki reports the clan's unfavourable situation to Araumi, believing it's only a matter of time before Kirigakure discovers where they are. Repairs to the mobile fortress are also delayed over lack of materials. Araumi yells to just steal it, but Isari counters they don't have the manpower, being spread thin on every front. Araumi asks about Funamushi, who Jibiki confirms should have received the order to cancel the ambush. Isari wants to retreat so they can regroup to launch another attack. Araumi is appalled that Isari would abandon avenging their men killed by Kirigakure, and Isari counters that they also have to protect those who are left. Araumi accuses Isari of becoming a coward during his imprisonment, Isari telling him he has no idea of what he and his siblings endured to rebuild the clan. Araumi asks about Ikada, and Isari still questions why Araumi expects so much from him. Araumi blames Isari for the loss of half their ships, Tenma's death, and Seiren's condition. Enraged, Isari transforms his harpoon, which Araumi reminds him was given to him by Araumi, so it won't defy his commands. Still angry, Isari leaves. Araumi swims to the seabed, and drops a pearl at a frozen woman, Minamo. He thinks back to a fight when Ikada was a newborn, feeling uncomfortable with him being on the battlefield, though Minamo remained unconcerned, believing he'd grow into a wonderful leader. Kirigakure launched freezing attacks, which hit Minamo. Araumi chastised her for protecting Ikada, but she made him promise her he'd raise Ikada well before being completely frozen and sinking. Back on land, Araumi is notified of Funamushi's death. He demands explanations from Gokai, who explains they couldn't back down from avenging Seiren, managing to kill Kagura, but failing to kill a Konoha shinobi, who Ikada understands to be Boruto. Kobuna and his mother arrive, and break down crying. Kobuna wants to know who was responsible, and Ikada tells him it's not his job to avenge him, that's for the adults to do. Araumi chastises him, asking when he'll want to avenge his family, and grows more furious when Ikada says he doesn't even remember his mother. Araumi says his mother will never be able to rest in peace if Ikada doesn't avenge her, Ikada saying he never wanted to be chosen. Ikada grows angrier as Araumi throws him around, Isari noticing a glass of water shaking. Ikada leaves, and Isari goes to check on him. Neither understand why Araumi places his hopes on Ikada, and Isari explains his indecisiveness causes them harm. He explains that Seiren would have gone straight to the ambush, but stopped to get Ikada because she believed his power was essential. Isari thinks Ikada is holding out hope that Seiren will get better so he has an excuse not to fight. A guard informs Ikada that Seiren called out for him. He rushes to see her, but her memories are hazy. She tries getting out of bed, dropping Kobuna's seashells on the floor and stepping one of them before falling down. She starts to bleed, telling Ikada that their future is bright, and to reclaim their seas. Ikada lies to her, claiming the ambush was successfully carried out by their father and himself, and that Kirigakure has been wiped out. She dies in peace. Kobuna has Gokai give him the same tattoo as his father's, and asks to take him to the ones who killed Funamushi. Isari talks to Jibiki, believing Araumi to be too consumed by hatred to make sound decisions. He wishes to make peace with Kirigakure, intending to take advantage of still having control over the seas, and certain that they also want to avoid an all-out war. Araumi has no idea, and he wishes to broach the subject with Kirigakure in secret. At dawn, Ikada rips his ship design paper and dives into the ocean. The waves stop as his power awakens, and waters raise him, now bearing gills. Araumi celebrates. Ikada dons a new outfit, with a harsh look in his eyes.\\n\"},\n",

Chōjūrō is frustrated, having hoped that Kagura would be Mizukage one day, and is determined to wipe out the Funato clan. A messenger arrives with a top secret message from Isari. Back in Kagura's village, everyone is in disbelief that Ikada is a Funato, but Boruto recalls the peculiarity of his body transformation, and believes it. He is heartbroken to have become the target of someone else's revenge. Misuno questions Chōjūrō why he'd agree to negotiate with the Funato. Chōjūrō personally has no reservations against wiping out the Funato, but as Mizukage, he knows the Funato maintain control over northeastern waters, and understands that drawing out the conflict would mean more casualties. Isari arrives with Jibiki. Though tense and filled with posturing, Chōjūrō and Isari agree to talk, however, the Funato suddenly take over the airwaves, and Araumi addresses Chōjūrō and the daimyō, announcing an offensive with their main forces. When Araumi says they'll crush anyone in their way, even if they're related, the Marlin Harpoon acts on its own and stabs Isari, killing him. Jibiki blames himself for not stopping Isari from coming. The harpoon attempts to attack Chōjūrō, but Misuno cuts it down. All over the Land of Water, everyone watches Araumi swear they won't back down to honour the many Funato they have lost. The Konoha shinobi and the swordsmen are shocked when Araumi announces that Ikada has joined him, and will lead them in battle, having previously thought Ikada couldn't fight. Their first target on the way to Kirigakure is the Shinonome 1. Chōjūrō gives the order to protect the power station and intercept the Funato. The captive Funato continues talking down to them, so Buntan knocks him out. Most of them want to keep fighting the Funato, even if Ikada is among them. Mitsuki asks Boruto what his feelings are, and Boruto still thinks of Ikada as his friend. He wants to talk Chōjūrō, who Sarada also wants to see, wishing to return Hiramekarei. Buntan and Kyohō intend to keep fighting to avenge Kagura and Hebiichigo, and attack. Iwabee and Denki protect them, buying them time to escape. Metal Lee does nothing, torn between his team-mates and his desire to avenge Hebiichigo. Kawaki is frustrated by Boruto's choice. Ikada wants the Funato main forces to sail through the Sea of Death, the shortest route to the Shinonome 1 so they can arrive before Kirigakure has time to prepare. Despite the Funato's apprehension in crossing such dangerous waters, Ikada motivates them. Chōjūrō is notified of it, and wants to set sail immediately. Araumi is pleased with Ikada's attitude.

Kajiki calls out to them, and Boruto asks to take them on his ship. Kajiki obliges, having heard the broadcast, not expecting it from Ikada, though Boruto feels he doesn't look surprised. Kajiki explains he comes from a family of fisherman, and he doesn't care much for how either the Funato or Kirigakure do things, and asks Boruto to tell both Ikada and the Mizukage that. He has faith that Boruto's words will reach Ikada. Boruto is impressed by Kajiki's ability to navigate the rough sea. Ikada takes the Funato fleet through enormous waves, impressing everyone. Araumi recalls how Ikada struggled with training when he was a little child, and wishes Tenma and Seiren could see him now. He also recalls how Jibiki informed him of Isari's plans, and instructed him to go along, while also instructing the Marlin Harpoon to kill Isari. Chōjūrō reflects on the losses caused by the Funato, vowing to end them. Kajiki drops Team 7 at the Mizukage's ship, Boruto identifying himself with Hiramekarei. He returns it to Chōjūrō, who asks why they're there. He appreciates it if they want to avenge Kagura, but thinks the situation has escalated too much for them to remain involved. Boruto says he wants the conflict to stop to avoid more casualties. Misuno is incensed by the suggestion, and though Chōjūrō understands Boruto, he can't do nothing and let the Funato destroy the Shinonome 1 station. They point out some people are against the station, and ask if they ever discussed it with the Funato. Misuno recounts how Isari came to talk to them about peace, but was killed by his own weapon as they began discussions, believing it to be a failed attempt to assassinate Chōjūrō. He asks what would be the point at talking at this point. Boruto instead asks time to talk to Ikada, explaining what they've been through together before learning he was a Funato. Chōjūrō has no faith in that, but Boruto points out how Kagura trusted Buntan and the others until the end, who eventually worked hard to meet Kagura's expectations. Chōjūrō agrees to give them some time to try getting the Funato to back off, but they refuse to take a guard with them. He asks Boruto what he'll do if he's unable to get the Funato to stop fighting, and Boruto says he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it. Ikada continues to use his power to navigate the furious waters, parting waves so their fleet can go through it. They get in sight of the Shinonome station and the Kirigakure fleet. Denki and Iwabee struggle to keep Kyohō and Buntan from going after Team 7, while Metal just wants them all the stop. Yamame and Iwana update the village on the upcoming clash between the Funato and Kirigakure. They agree to stop fighting and go after Boruto as allies for now. Sarada pilots Kajiki's ship. Misuno asks Chōjūrō why he's taking such a risk with Boruto, and he explains that Boruto was able to change Kagura's mind in the past, so he's hoping he can pull it off again. Sarada and Mitsuki ask Boruto how he'll get through to Ikada, who seemed so different in the broadcast. Boruto considers himself to be the reason why Ikada changed, and asks Sarada and Mitsuki to trust and watch over him. Kirigakure and the Funato rally their forces in anticipation for an all-out battle. Team 7 sail towards the Funato.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto comments that it's one of Kajiki's ships, which he lent them when they said they wanted to meet with Ikada. Ikada destroys the ship with a waterspout, Mitsuki pulling Boruto and Sarada onto the Funato ship. Kirigakure listens in on their conversation from afar. Ikada tells Boruto not to ask for anything ridiculous, threatening to kill them. Boruto wants the Funato to stop the war, and Araumi laughs. Boruto explains he spoke with Chōjūrō, who agreed to stop fighting if the Funato stop as well. Araumi and Ikada both can't take the Mizukage at face value. Misuno isn't surprised by their lack of cooperation, but Chōjūrō says they promised Team 7 some more time. Araumi says they won't leave the ship alive, and leaves to attend another matter. Ikada assures them he intends to fight until one side goes down. Boruto reminds him of his dreams of building a big ship, sailing the world with it, connecting islands and people by trading goods. Ikada says those dreams died with Seiren, and manifests several waterspouts around the ship. Metal informs his team-mates and the swordsmen that Team 7 went aboard a Funato ship, and they get concerned. Buntan thinks joining up with them is the best way to get revenge on the Funato. Ikada blames them for the death of his sister, brother, and Funamushi, and claims that even if Kirigakure is destroyed or they die, his hatred will never be abated. He says that Seiren always protected him, and that he felt inferior for being the only one in his family without powers, claiming that wanting to become a shipbuilder was an excuse he tried making himself believe. Now that he has power, he will use it to lead the Funato and destroy Kirigakure. The waterspouts subside, the Funato's mobile fortress arrives, the Shinonome 1 in firing range of its charging Chakra Cannon. Araumi takes a boat to the mobile fortress, which Kawaki notices. Sarada and Mitsuki tell Boruto he's tried more than enough. Boruto says he understand how Ikada feels, recalling his own feelings about Kagura's death, and once again asks to end the war. Ikada hits him, telling him he's abandoned the past. Sarada says they're also putting side the feelings of losing people dear to them to stop the war, and Mitsuki adds that there are people who need the Shinonome 1. Ikada calls Kobuna in to confront Boruto. Boruto comments on how Kobuna is like him when he lost Kagura, Ikada saying Kobuna will never abandon his hatred until he kills Boruto. Ikada claims he'll put his sword away if Boruto brings him the Mizukage's head. Kawaki spies on Araumi, having followed him to the chakra cannon on the mobile fortress. Boruto can't do what Ikada asked, but offers up his own life instead.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Mitsuki and Sarada are shocked by Boruto's proposal. So is Chōjūrō back on Kirigakure's fleet. Ikada says Boruto's life isn't enough to stop the war, but Boruto says it's all he can do. Sarada and Mitsuki try to dissuade Boruto, Mitsuki saying he can't afford to lose Boruto. Ikada says he'll consider it if Sarada and Mitsuki can stay back and watch Boruto die, but they refuse. Boruto says he's scared of dying, and believes that everyone who has died in the war felt the same, that others were saddened by their deaths. He feels that someone has to be the one to take on the pain to stop the war, and is willing to be that person, and asks Sarada and Mitsuki not to take revenge for him. Gokai interjects, arguing that as the one who killed Funamushi, Boruto doesn't deserve an easy death. Ikada allows him and the others to attack Boruto, while Boruto asks Sarada and Mitsuki to stay still. Araumi considers what Ikada came up with fun. Kawaki wonders what Boruto is doing as he prepares to kill Araumi. Sarada and Mitsuki approach Boruto on the floor, while Ikada mocks them. Sarada asks Boruto if he trusts the Funato to stop fighting after he dies, but standing up, Boruto says it's not about trust, it's about what he needs to do. Ikada stops the other Funato from attacking, saying Kobuna has the right of delivering the killing blow. Ikada explains that the strong currents where they are will never allow him to resurface, showing them a ramp for Boruto to be tossed off the ship. Chōjūrō allows Misuno to prepare an attack on the mobile fortress, thinking Boruto's naivete won't stop the war. Team 5 and the swordsmen approach the Funato on a ship of their own. Kobuna is eager to avenge his father, and Boruto tells Kobuna how alike they were in seeking revenge. Boruto's wish for his death to quell their anger and hatred shakes Kobuna's resolve, and Boruto says he doesn't have to get blood on his hands, stepping off the ship himself. Ikada dares Sarada and Mitsuki to try avenging Boruto. Mitsuki struggles not to get into Sage Mode. Ikada is puzzled by their inaction despite the Funato taunting them about Boruto. Sarada confirms that she does hate them, having known Boruto since childhood, considering him a brother. Relating to that pain, and finding it impossible to suppress, Ikada eggs her on to take revenge. She does activate her Sharingan and take out a kunai, but she stops herself, throwing it on the floor. Mitsuki does the same, saying that if they attack, Boruto's wish will be in vain. Kobuna begins sobbing, and asks Ikada to tell him if he did the right thing by avenging his father. Ikada thinks of Seiren, and jumps into the ocean to save Boruto. He rises out in a sea dragon, going far enough up to split the storm clouds above them. Everyone is in awe of Ikada's power. Araumi is angry that he saved Boruto. Boruto is surprised to be alive, and Ikada tells him he won, his friends not trying to take revenge. Boruto tells him it's not about winning or losing. Ikada returns them to the ship, dispelling the sea dragon. Gokai questions why Ikada saved him, and he plainly answers because they didn't seek revenge. He declares the war over and orders their withdrawal. Gokai questions why Seiren and Funamushi died for. One of the Funato soldiers wants the fighting to stop so his children don't get drawn into it. Kobuna continues crying, and several Funato soldiers drop their harpoons, Gokai considering them a disgrace. Araumi aims the Chakra Cannon to the Shinonome 1, voicing his disappointment in Ikada. Kawaki enters the room, and tells him he's already lost to Boruto and Ikada. Araumi refuses to give up, so Kawaki slashes his throat with his bladed arm. Gokai tries to rile up the Funato soldiers to keep on fighting, but Boruto wants their future to be different from their past, mentioning Kagura's wish for his village to be a symbol of peace. Chōjūrō admits he has a lot to learn, having dismissed Boruto's determination as naivete. Buntan chooses to abandon seeking revenge for Kagura and Hebiichigo. Ikada tells Boruto he is tired of hating and being hated, preferring if everyone can keep smiling. Boruto tells him he wished to talk and laugh with Ikada again.\\n\"},\n",

Katasuke was impressed by Boruto's willingness to risk his life to end the conflict, which has bolstered Konoha's reputation. Shikamaru explains that the Funato lost much influence and have been placed under surveillance by Kirigakure. Gokai, Kobuna, and his mother visit Funamushi's grave. Gokai promises to raise Kobuna into someone Funamushi would be proud of. Kobuna wants to be strong to protect everyone. Jibiki, still distraught about Isari's death, as well as Araumi, have been imprisoned. Boruto asks about Ikada, Naruto telling him that Chōjūrō made no mention of him. Naruto and Shikamaru speculate that due to his position and involvement, he's likely to face charges. Boruto wants to contact Chōjūrō to confirm Ikada's status. Kawaki sees nothing wrong with Ikada facing punishment, as he was a commander. Boruto points out that Ikada stopped the fighting, and that resentment over punishing him despite that might spark the conflict again. Kawaki reminds him that Araumi aimed the Chakra Cannon at both Boruto and Ikada, finding Boruto's outlook too naive. Boruto and Kawaki keep arguing over the cycle of hate and revenge. Kawaki leaves and comes across Team 5. Iwabee deduces he fought with Boruto based on his mood. Denki has to stop things from escalating, and they recall Kagura's wishes. Kawaki finds them naive as well. In Kirigakure, Misuno hands Chōjūrō damage reports, which they'll need a lot of time to recover from. They also discuss the great loss of lives as well, including the daimyō's son. The daimyō has requested harsh punishment for ringleaders Araumi and Ikada. Chōjūrō understands it but is concerned about further antagonising those who supported the Funato, concluding that the Land of Water modernising too quickly created the strain that led to this conflict. Naruto and Boruto talk about what he went through in private. Naruto relates to how Boruto feels, having gone through something similar. He tells Boruto to patch things up with Kawaki. Mitsuki checks up on Kawaki, feeling that Kawaki had mixed feelings during his argument with Boruto. He thinks Boruto has influenced Kawaki, so much so that Kawaki didn't kill Araumi. Buntan and Kyohō visit Kagura's and Hebiichigo's graves, recounting how the conflict ended. Buntan will return to Kirigakure, while Kyohō decides to stay and protect the village. He asks her about Shizuma. She hasn't forgotten her grudge, but no longer wants revenge. Instead, she intends to capture him and make him pay for his crimes. Buntan tells him to take care of their friends' graves. Shikamaru informs Naruto of a follow-up communication from Chōjūrō, which Naruto wishes to inform Boruto about. Chōjūrō informs Ikada they've decided what to do with him and informs him that the Shinonome Project has been halted, in a bid to get proper popular support before developing the nation. This smoothed things over with most Funato supporters, who were against it. However, they're still concerned that someone might want to organise another movement around Ikada, who is the only Funato heir left. Out of gratitude for his decision to stop the conflict, Chōjūrō decided not to imprison Ikada, but instead to put him under surveillance, under Kajiki. Sarada tries to get Boruto and Kawaki to talk to patch things up, but they end up fighting. Sarada is concerned, but Mitsuki and Naruto join her, tell her not to worry and let them fight. They tire themselves out, so Naruto helps them up, deciding to treat them to ramen. He also informs them of Chōjūrō's decision regarding Ikada.\\n\"},\n",

Chōchō explains that while Team 7 was in the Land of Water, Shikadai was selected for a mission with another team, so she and Inojin have just been on standby. Boruto and Sarada reason that Shikadai's reputation also depends on his team's. Inojin and Chōchō become concerned they're holding Shikadai back, and that he should partner up with more varied and experienced shinobi. Suika Kannonji gives them a mission of apprehending a Kumo missing-nin named Jingo Kumano, who according to the Konoha Barrier Team is hiding in the village and procuring all sorts of weapons. Chōchō and Inojin are asked to take the mission by themselves while Shikadai is with other shinobi investigating thieves looking to acquire top-secret data. They find Jingo making a purchase at Ninja Tools Roll Roll Roll, and follow him into an alley. They apprehend him, not impressed by his performance. While going through his belongings, they find ingredients, and Jingo explains it's for a ramen recipe. Kohan Yamanaka arrives, and apologises for the situation. Jingo was a missing-nin, but has since been pardoned by his village, the barrier team's records being out of date. Jingo now owns a ramen shop, and his purchase was a kitchen knife. Chōchō is hungry, and Jingo offers to try his ramen. Shikadai's team pursues thieves who are after Scientific Ninja Tool data. The thieves bump into Jingo, and their stolen data gets mixed up with one of Jingo's spice containers. Arriving at Jingo's shop, he explains he learned that a ramen critic will visit his ship the next day, so he wishes to impress them for a favourable article to attract clients. However, he's not confident he can create a new recipe. Chōchō is moved by how his life turned around over being treated at Ramen Ichiraku. Inojin and Chōchō offer to help him to make up for apprehending him by mistake. At a hideout, the data thieves discover the mix up with Jingo. Chōchō and Inojin help Jingo gather more unique ingredients with his shinobi skills, and critique his cooking process. Jingo's ramen is good, but they feel something is missing. At night, Jingo returns to the shop, having forgotten his wallet, and is attacked by thieves after the memory card with the stolen data, which Chōchō borrowed thinking it was spice for her chips. Inojin senses something wrong with Jingo, and they arrived at his thrashed shop, where he draws birds to track him. Shikadai's team finds the thieves' hideout, and he recognises Jingo from earlier. He notices Inojin's birds, and sends him a message, notifying them of their location. The thieves demand to know where the data is, but Jingo knows nothing about it. The Konoha shinobi all subdue the thieves. Chōchō rushes Jingo to finish his recipe, and Shikadai suspects he's still involved when the data isn't recovered from the thieves. Shikadai checks on Inojin and Chōchō on Jingo's shop, where he discovers the missing data when Chōchō tries putting the spice on her ramen. As Shikadai talks about team-work, it inspires Jingo on how to improve his recipe, using flavoured chips like the ones Chōchō eats to change it up. Team 10 approves his recipe. Later, Teams 10 and 7 go have ramen at Jingo's but there's a long line over the positive review from the ramen critic.\\n\"},\n",

However, Himawari won a hot springs trip in a lottery, so Naruto decided to take time off so they could go as a family. Shikamaru reminds him it has to be him, as the movie's climax will feature a Rasengan. Naruto dreads telling Himawari he'll miss the trip, fearing she'll block his tenketsu again. Konohamaru offers to go in Naruto's place, as he also knows the Rasengan, and tells Naruto to enjoy his trip. Konohamaru arrives at the studio, and introduces himself to the crew. He also meets Kagemasa's actor, Gongorō Kamakura, who has hurt his back and is done filming for the day. Gongorō says he'll forego a prep meeting the next day. The crew hands Konohamaru a script, and immediately ask to start shooting a scene. Despite being able to transform into Naruto, the make-up artists merely draw his whiskers on. Konohamaru shoots a scene in a green screen, he thinks he fumbled his line, but the crew members are unconcerned. Konohamaru is also appalled by how the actor portraying Shikamaru is so unlike him. Konohamaru watches a fixed version of the scene they shot, with effects added in, and feels like he's filmed in an assembly line. The assistant director agrees, and comments on how the director used to film, which is what inspired him to join the business. However, since the current producer joined in, things have shifted more towards CG instead of practical effects and filming on location instead of relying on the skill of cast and crew. Konohamaru expresses his wish to convey how cool Naruto is in the fight scene the next day. The assistant director hides the key to the studio, forcing them to shoot on location, which Konohamaru helps by getting a number of stores to close. This also forces everyone to try harder. The producer is furious the shooting was done without his permission, and ends up firing everyone other than the main actors. Konohamaru and the crew go drinking, and the director asks Konohamaru to bear with it and go back shooting for Gongorō's sake. The next day, Konohamaru sees the assistant director in a hostage situation by a bank, and assists with the situation, but ends up making the situation worse by bringing up the hostage holder's family, who are the other criminals he just attacked. The director watches it, wishing he could film it. The rest of the crew arrives, having seen the assistant director on tv, and they agree they should film it. They ask for the camera of the news crew broadcasting the situation. Gongorō arrives at the studio, and sees the director trying to get the camera. The hostage holder threatens to blow up the area with an explosive tag. Gongorō shows up as Kagemasa, which distracts the criminal enough for Konohamaru to deal with the explosive tag. However, his kunai is chipped and doesn't cut through the tag. Gongorō manages to punch him out, his back giving out, but not before the criminal activates the tag. Konohamaru wonders how to escape while carrying Gongorō and the assistant director, both injured, but Gongorō reminds him he's acting as the Hokage. Konohamaru contains the explosion with a Rasengan. The director mentions how they used to make the Kagemasa movies in the beginning, when they had no budget or equipment, and that Konohamaru reminded them of that. The producer is impressed with the footage, and hires everyone back, the sponsors having been moved by the footage. The director also has the producer prepare the CG for an extra flash finale, and praises the assistant director's eye. At home, Konohamaru sharpens his kunai while listening to positive news about the movie.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto and Kawaki notice a slash in one of the statues in the inn. The hostess takes them to their room, and they eat. Boruto suggests they play ping-pong, but is frustrated when Kawaki struggles to learn the basics. Naruto and Hinata win against Boruto and Kawaki with their superior team-work while Himawari acts as referee. They have a luxurious dinner and go to the hot springs.

Boruto has heard rumours it might be a weasel, but the others think it's a human culprit. The next day, they confirm with the Konoha Police Force that the latest victim is a former shinobi from another village, who specialised in Wind Release. Based on method, they believe all ex-shinobi were attacked by the same person. Kawaki suggests guarding all ex-shinobi users of Wind Release, but Boruto points out too many people fit that description. Team 7 is asked to continue nightly patrols. Boruto and Sarada notice Mitsuki is distracted, and he explains that Mikazuki hasn't shown since returning from Kirigakure. Kawaki asks what Mikazuki looks like, and Boruto suggests putting up missing posters. They decide to rest, and suggest Mitsuki do the same. Mitsuki asks around, but finds nothing. He finds a girl playing the flute, and Mikazuki approaches her, though she calls it Niboshi. It recognises Mitsuki when called Mikazuki. She explains she found it in pain next to her house, so she took it to the vet. After giving it food, Mikazuki decided to stay. Mitsuki notes she knows more about Mikazuki than he does, and she finds it nice that Mikazuki has the freedom to go wherever they want. She explains that since moving to Konoha one year ago, she has had to help her older brother. He asks her to look after Mikazuki when he's away on missions. Hibiki's brother calls out to her. After Mitsuki leaves, her brother reminds her not to befriend shinobi. Another ex-shinobi is attacked, and Team 7 pursues them, Mitsuki managing to injure one of two assailants on the arm. He stops at Hibiki's brother's oden cart, asking if he saw the assailants. He claims they escaped to the roof. Mitsuki notices blood by the stand, but tells the team to resume pursuit while he goes check on the victim. Hibiki hides injured behind the stand. In their apartment, Hibiki's brother tends to her injury. She wonders if they should stop. He says they only have one more target before he can assure she has a normal life. The public pressures the police upon learning of another attack. The police reports to Team 7 that there was a smell of smoke on the victims clothes, and they speculate this might be how they're knocked unconscious. They wonder if the slashed clothes means they're looking for something, and are waiting for more information on similar incidents in other villages. The shopkeeper Mitsuki spoke to, also an ex-shinobi, reads about the attacks on the newspaper. He throws a rock at Mikazuki when taking out the trash. Mitsuki thinks back to the Rain Killer incident. He asks Hibiki who the next target is. She explains her father was a shinobi who was killed by a thief who used Wind Release, who was left with a scar on his chest by her father's sword. Mitsuki reveals he failed to stop someone like them in the past, wishing to avoid past mistakes. He asks that she turn herself in. She thanks Mitsuki for letting her go once, and leaves. At night, the police learns that a person of interest in a series of robberies and murders is living in Konoha. Hibiki and her brother use sleeping smoke on the Matsushige shopkeeper, but reading about it on the newspaper allowed him to counter it. They ask if he has a scar on his chest. Kōtarō Fūma reports to Team 7 that Daizen Matsushige is a Wind Release user who was a witness to robberies and murders. Mitsuki realises he's the shopkeeper he spoke with and rushes ahead. Daizen intends to kill Hibiki and her brother in self-defence, and attacks with the Sickle Weasel Technique, which Hibiki's brother recognises. Mitsuki blocks an attack with his Lightning Release: Snake Lightning. Team 7 and Kōtarō arrive, Daizen accusing Hibiki and her brother of being behind the slashing attacks, Hibiki accusing Daizen of having the scar that proves he killed her father. Daizen shows his chest, bearing no scar, but Mikazuki jumps on him, scratching his chest, removing the disguise and revealing the scar. He says the scar isn't proof of any crime, but Mitsuki points out the injury he gave Hibiki with his Wind Release. Kōtarō intends to compare it with injuries from the other robberies and murders. Daizen tries running away, but Mitsuki stops him with Wind Release: Breakthrough. Daizen was planning to commit the same crimes in Konoha, so Hibiki and her brother are only banished from the village. However, since Mitsuki withheld his knowledge of their guilt, he's on administrative leave for a week. He bids Hibiki and her brother farewell, and she gives him niboshi to feed Mikazuki.\\n\"},\n",

Boruto wonders if they should interfere, but Kakashi argues against it. Boruto wonders if he was really a Hokage, and Kakashi says he has had his fill of mediating fights with Naruto and Sasuke. When more people join the old men's argument, Boruto tries breaking them up. One of the man's grandson and the other's granddaughter also try stopping the fight, before both sides decide to leave. As he leaves, the girl's grandfather knocks Kakashi's tea, spilling it on his face. He is unfazed by it. The girl apologises and gives them a complementary dish. Boruto asks what the fight was about. She explains that a rivalry developed over setting off festival fireworks between people of the old town and the new city. Boruto noticed the interaction between Yubeshi and Sabure, and she confesses they're planning to get married, having already picked a date, but with all the arguing, they haven't been able to inform their grandfathers. Kakashi was reading an Icha Icha volume, but heard Yubeshi, and compares her story to what happened in volume 5 of the series, though he doesn't know how it ended, its intensity caused many readers to pass out, so it was removed from the book after the first edition. Yubeshi shows Kakashi her first edition copy of that volume, which she considered throwing away after being unable to sell it at the flea market. She asks Kakashi to sort the situation between their grandfathers before giving it to him. They visit Taruto's pastry shop, and Kakashi deduces from photos and covered menus that he and Ohagi were close for a long time, and remained so until rather recently. He asks them to leave. Sabure checks on them, and explains how their fight started when Taruto, who used to participate in old town's fireworks display with Ohagi, was put in charge of new city's display when they decided to start one. Kakashi left while Boruto was listening to Sabure, leaving a note that he has more shopping to do and leaving the situation to Boruto. Boruto goes back to Ohagi's dango shop to get him to talk to Taruto. Boruto gathers everyone to talk about the dispute, including Kakashi. They argue until Boruto signals for Sabure and Yubeshi to bring in the dango cakes that Ohagi and Taruto developed together. Boruto thinks this might remind them of their friendship, but it only underlines the time period of when the dispute began. Kakashi suggests that Yubeshi and Sabure elope, but they want their grandfathers to celebrate with them. Since they can't make peace over it, Kakashi suggests turning it into a competition on the day of the festival, with the winner being responsible for the fireworks from then on. Sabure, Yubeshi, and Boruto are unsure of it, but Kakashi is confident in his plan, and disappears as both sides begin making preparations. Someone mentions to the new city group that the weather is perfect for fireworks that day, with no clouds in the sky, though no one knows who that is. When the fireworks start, Yubeshi and Sabure recognise something about the display. So do Ohagi and Taruto, who wish to stop the fireworks, but can't. Kakashi switched new city's and old town's fireworks, so each side was actually mocking their own fireworks, causing them to lose heart about the rivalry. Later, Kakashi asks Taruto and Ohagi who was the winner, and Sabure and Yubeshi urge them to make up, pointing out they no longer seem to have fun setting up the fireworks, and that they can't get married with them fighting. Their grandfathers are surprised by it, and realising what they put their grandchildren though, make up. The next day, Boruto puts soothing bandages on Kakashi's back, which is hurting from moving the heavy fireworks around. Kakashi also got Yubeshi's first edition Icha Icha volume, but is taking his time reading it so he can enjoy it. Sabure and Yubeshi get married, with their grandfathers in attendance.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Iruka welcomes a new class of Academy students. Naruto gives them a speech about what he hopes they learn. Among the new students are Himawari, her friends Ehō Norimaki and Yuina Itomaki, and Kawaki. She is glad they're with her. Some boys ask Mimi for a trick with her dog. Kawaki is in the Academy for a secret mission, guarding Kae Yukiwari, heir to the crown in the Land of Bamboo, a smaller ally nation. Kae's life is being threatened by another claimant to the crown, so her father sent her to Konoha for protection. Kae herself is unaware of the threat, and is excited to study abroad. Kawaki is lower profile than Boruto, and is to keep at the mission until Kae's father uncovers who is behind the threat. Naruto also asked him to keep the mission from Himawari. Their homeroom teacher, Hana Kaka, introduces herself, followed by other students. Most of the class is excited about Himawari being Naruto's daughter, Osuka Kamakura being Gongorō Kamakura's daughter, and Kae being a princess from a foreign nation. Most of them are scared of Kawaki, though Kae finds him interesting. Eiki Fūma develops a crush on her, and Osuka is annoyed at not being the centre of attention. Kawaki approaches Kae, and mistakenly comes across as hitting on her. Hana is quite timid, as this is her first class as a teacher. Anko and Shino reassure her she'll get better at it. At home, Himawari tells about her day, and Boruto wonders why Kawaki would want to attend the Academy. Himawari wants to ask Kawaki why he was acting strange at the Academy, and Boruto wonders if he was nervous. As the days go by, the students continue finding Kawaki odd, knowing personal details about Naruto, but nothing about the previous Hokage, getting battle-ready when woken up by the school bell, and having a cute, packed lunchbox. Himawari notices him paying attention to Kae, and can tell Kawaki is hiding something. She tells him of Kae's interest in romance novels, so he buys one, puzzled at how it might be useful. Reporters come to take photos of her at class. Eiki tries to best Kawaki, who he finds suspicious, in sparring to impress Kae, but he effortlessly dodges all of Eiki's attacks. At the infirmary, Eiki hears Anko and Hana talking about the tool storage room, and sneaks into it. Kawaki finds Kae acting like herself, and she explains people have expectations of how a princess should act, so she plays along as she's a representative of her country. Eiki arrives, thinking Kawaki lured Kae somewhere remote, and attacks him with a summoning scroll. However, he lacks a contract, and is knocked out by the summoned creature. Kawaki defeats the summon with a punch, commenting on his preference for such missions. She asks who he is, and he says he just wants to be her friend, and offers her the romance novel he bought. She promises to be his friend if he keeps her true personality a secret. Kawaki bemoans having to keep another secret, but accepts it. She looks forward to knowing him, and is concerned about Eiki, but Kawaki says he'll wake up soon. At night, a subordinate asks about her time in the Academy, and Kae is pleased to have made a friend, wanting to enjoy the last of her freedom. Kawaki reports to Naruto about the mission, and complains about the low-level exercises. Naruto tells him he'll see things to learn at the Academy. Himawari listens in on them through the door, excited to learn about Kawaki's secret mission.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"At the Academy, Himawari asks Kawaki if he'll be protecting Kae again that day, startling him. He deduces she eavesdropped on him. She promises to keep his secret mission quiet, and explains he's been acting different since starting at the Academy. Himawari offers to help him, but he refuses. Kae's class-mates noticed how little she eats compared to everyone else, attributing it to her refined upbringing. Osuka brags about her personal chef, and bosses Neon about her tea, which she delivers with a drone. Because her parents are executives at the Kaminarimon Company, she has access to many prototypes. Eiki remains suspicious of Kawaki. Kae excuses to herself to have a proper meal alone. Kawaki warns that if she insists on keeping up appearances, she'll never hit it off with anyone. Kae decides to host an event to let her make many friends at once. Osuka is planning to host a tea party, and denies wanting friends when Neon suggests that's the case, claiming she wants to emulate her mother. At the classroom, Kae invites everyone to a tea party that weekend. Ehō passes on it, and Osuka is frustrated on being upstaged. At night, Kawaki recalls Naruto's and Shikamaru's instructions to protect her at the party, and decides to figure the tea party out as it unfolds. Himawari startles him, saying that's not an option, and stresses the importance of proper tea party etiquette, saying he needs her help. Kae decorates a cake by herself, despite Batora's opinion of it being unnecessary. Kae wants to be a perfect host, like her mother used to be, recalling her advice to do things her own way. The next day, Kae's class-mates are impressed by the tea party, but are puzzled by Kawaki's presence. Kawaki's unconvincing answer when Eiki questions his attendance requires Himawari to cover for him. When he claims his favourite sweet is taiyaki, the kids are surprised that Kae doesn't know what it is. Kawaki struggles to remember Himawari's instructions, drawing attention to himself, but she aids him quickly. Osuka tries to downplay her enjoyment of Kae's tea. When she mentions her parents' actor friends attending tea parties at her house, Himawari mentions Gaara as a friend of her parents who visits them, who their class-mates find even more impressive, frustrating Osuka. Kae and Himawari bond over having leaders for fathers. Kae asks Kawaki why he decided to attend the Academy, and recalling Himawari's advice not to talk anything violent, claims that he could have his fill of taiyaki by earning money as a shinobi. They laugh, being more at ease with Kawaki's awkwardness when they previously found him scary. When Kae leaves to get the cake, a few of the kids comment on how exhausting the formality of the party is. Kae's servants serve the cake, which Osuka secretly injected with spicy mustard. Kawaki smells it, and thinking it's an assassin's poison, rushes over, knocking over the tables to stop Kae from eating it. He also knocks over Batora. Eiki, covered in cake, starts fighting Kawaki. Kae tells them to stop, and asks why Kawaki did it. He can't answer her without exposing his mission. She feels sad, having put so much effort in the cake, and is hurt when Kawaki is dismissive of it. He leaves to cool off, and Osuka is pleased the party was ruined. Neon goes to the restroom. Himawari admonishes Kawaki, telling him to apologise, but to him, if she hates him, that's ok. She realises Kawaki did it because of the mission, and he explains there was something in the cake. Himawari realises it was just a prank with mustard, not an assassination attempt. They deduce it was Osuka, but Himawari wants evidence before accusing her. They check with Batora that the freezer where the cake was stored was closed, but they spot a small open window. Kawaki realises something, and tells Himawari to get to Kae before him. Osuka berates Kae for the incident, who feels she can't react emotionally because of her status. Other students think Osuka is going overboard with it. Himawari arrives, showing everyone the cake had mustard hidden in it. Kawaki arrives with Neon's drone, exposing Osuka as having ordered her to do it, having already questioned Neon, who confessed everything. Osuka tries blaming everything on Neon. Kae yells at her to apologise to Neon and everyone. She's fine with Osuka being upfront with disliking her, but can't forgive forcing Neon into doing something she doesn't want to do. Osuka starts to cry, and Neon attempts to console her. Kae tries to compose herself, but her outburst has endeared her to everyone else. Himawari and Kawaki advise her not to suppress herself. Kawaki says they should give the party another try, and brings in a lot of taiyaki, which Kae tries and enjoys. He apologises for before. Kae is happy it turned out ok, recalling her mother. Osuka promises it's not over between them. Himawari gets Kawaki to admit she helped him, so he won't refuse her help again with the mission. However, he won't let Himawari risk herself.\\n\"},\n",

Himawari points out that Hana is pleased that Kawaki made friends, concerned for her student. Kawaki has been unimpressed with her. He mentions that Himawari might have a better chance at learning ninjutsu from special instructors coming to their class. At the Academy, the students speculate and gossip on who the special instructors might be. Ehō wants them to acknowledge him so he can go on missions with them in the future, impressing Yuina. Soul Tao finds it pretentious. Hana arrives, and introduces Team 7 as the instructors, to the delight of the class and Kawaki's discomfort. The students are impressed by Boruto's Rasengan. Kawaki asks Boruto not to let the students know he's already a genin. Kawaki loses his patience with Boruto, the two start fighting, and get called out by Sarada. She and Mitsuki demonstrate Fire Release and Lightning Release. Hana warns the students not to get too close, and pushes them away from their jutsu with Wind Release when they do. Many of the students ask Team 7 to be their teachers. Hana feels deflated, lacking flashy jutsu. Shino is concerned about Hana, and Anko points out her qualifications, hoping she'll be able to display her true abilities. Everyone is hungry, and were told not to bring lunch. Boruto arrives with Lightning Burgers, which the students will have to fight over, to simulate missions in which they have to fight on empty stomachs. Team 7 sets up who has to fight with who, whoever retains a rubber ball in the end gets to eat, but there are fewer burgers than there are students. They're free to use any ninjutsu, can fight alone or in groups, but will be disqualified if they leave Academy grounds. Sarada gives the go ahead. Neon steals Yuina's with her drone. Hana is concerned, but Team 7's goal is for them to realise they can share the burgers. Mimi eats a candy bar, because it's enough for her, and she doesn't want to take anyone's food. Ehō takes it away, as it defeats the purpose of the exercise, and her dog bites him. Soul tells him to give it back, as there were no rules against the candy bars, seeing it as reading a hidden meaning. Tensions escalate between the students over it. Himawari and Kae inform Boruto about it. He tells about sharing the burgers, but they remain hostile with each other. The next day, only Kae is in class when Himawari and Kawaki arrive, everyone else boycotting class after taking sides with Ehō or Soul. Shino thinks the lesson might have been too advanced for students who know little of team-work. Boruto tries having them make up by playing Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls, but they remain hostile. Kawaki tries reconciling them over food, but they also have different preferences. Hana checks up on the students' records to find what preference they share. Hana visits Soul, and reveals to her that her hero, Might Guy, had a friendly rivalry with Kakashi Hatake, which helped both of them grow, and hopes the same can be true for her. She gifts a tracksuit like Guy's, though Soul isn't as fond of it as she is of Guy, and hands her a letter. Next, she talks to Ehō over ramen at Ichiraku's, also giving him a letter. She's concerned she's not cut out to be a teacher, but is determined to help her students. The next day, everyone waits for Hana outside. She has cancelled class for the day, so everyone can have a cherry blossom viewing party. She uses jutsu to spread paper petals. Soul and Ehō agree to go back to class over seeing how hard Hana is trying and how much she cares about them. Kawaki asks Hana what she would have done if no one had shown up, and she says she had to have faith in her students if she's to have faith in herself as a teacher. They all have a picnic. Shino and Anko note Hana's improvement, and Boruto declines their invitation to teach again.\\n\"},\n",

Himawari suggests investigating the places involved with the Academy's Seven Mysteries at night. Kae joins the group, so Kawaki complains about having to tag along. Himawari prepares the route to investigate all the mysteries. Ran and Suzu try to one up each other. Kura produces several trinkets while looking for ink for Yuina's pen. Shino arrives and tells them that while they can stay after hours, they have to clean the Academy as part of their training. The students leave, misremembering Shino's name. Kawaki offers to clean up, and Shino regrets not having much interaction with students lately. At night, they enter the Academy. Kae splits from the main group, and explains to Kawaki there's no way the Seven Mysteries are real, so to preserve everyone else's dreams, she had Batora fake them. Kae convinces Kawaki to help them. The rest of the group notices their absence. Kura wonders if one of the mysteries got to them, and the twins try to assure one another it's ok for them to leave. Batora and Kawaki scare the group as moving anatomical models. Sōsha flees in fear. In the training area, kunai barely miss them, but when Himawari turns the lights on, no one else is there. In a bathroom, Batora uses Water Release to scare them with red paint. Ran and Suzu flee. In the courtyard, Kawaki and Batora carry a statue of the Third Hokage, making it appear to move on its own. Himawari chases after it, and activating her Byakugan, sees it's Kawaki and Batora carrying it. She lets them go, pretending to the others she couldn't catch up. Kae returns to the main group, and Kawaki wonders why she's so committed to this. Batora explains that as heir, she was never able to act as a child, or play with friends and even her younger brother. He believes Kae is taking the opportunity to reclaim these experiences. Kawaki sympathises with the situation. When Kae returns, she notices his enthusiasm for continuing to scare the students. In the director's office, Iruka's portrait takes on a monstrous appearance, and a long tongue comes out of the frame. Everyone is scared, and Kura flees. Kae explains to Kawaki that while they're called Seven Mysteries, there are only six known mysteries, the nature of the seventh one also a mystery. Only Himawari, Ehō, and Yuina remain to check on the next mystery, a mirror that drags those reflected on it to another world. A shrouded figures appears above them, but it's not Batora, who arrived late over organising the supply room. Ehō and Yuina faint, and Kawaki attacks the figure, who dodges him and flees. Kae wants to uncover the figure's identity, and goes after it. Kawaki tells Himawari to take care of her friends, so he and Batora go after Kae. The mysteries they faked before all manifest for Kae, Kawaki, and Batora through the Academy. Kae thinks the mysteries are angry with them over being faked. They decide to check the faculty room, since none of the mysteries are associated with it. There, they find Shino, who gets covered in glowing pain, and explains that he was cleaning the faculty room. He doesn't know anything about mysteries, but determines that his insects were responsible, since Shino uses them to clean more effectively. The remaining students arrive, Yuina and Ehō fleeing over thinking the glowing Shino is a ghost. Leaving the building, Sōsha wants to write about it in the school paper. The twins continue to tease each other. Kae asks Kawaki not to reveal what they did to Himawari. The next day, the group tells the other students about their experiences, and the glowing ghost of the faculty room becomes the seventh mystery. Shino is pleased the students are talking about him in a way. Kawaki deduces Himawari discovered everything with her Byakugan, but she confesses she thought it was all real at first, and is glad Kae had so much fun. Kawaki thanks her.\\n\"},\n",

Himawari is placed with Kae and Sōsha, Kawaki with Harika and Soul. Hana wants them to strengthen their team-work. On their way home, Himawari discusses Kawaki's mission with him, assuring him she'll look after Kae during the exercise. Kawaki doesn't fist bump her, and instead warns her not to let Kae find out about his mission. The next day, Sōsha and Himawari pick Kae to be team leader. Harika and Soul pick Kawaki as leader over being older. Hana says the best team will get a gift from her. Konashi tries talking to Kae, but changes his mind. Eiki and Osuka get into a rivalry over whose team is stronger. Hana warns everyone not to go too deep into the forest. The first is a Tree Climbing Practice relay race. Kawaki's focus on protecting Kae distracts him from performing for his team, who complain about it to him. Eiki's team with Suzu and Neon performs the best in this test. Kawaki also gets distracted during a shurikenjutsu test, Himawari's team placing first. They stop to make lunch. Instead of using sticks to make fire, Kande uses Lightning Release, impressing his team-mates. Hana gives them ingredients and a curry recipe to follow. Himawari has to pull Kawaki aside to explain Eiki has a crush on Kae when he misunderstands Sōsha's gossip. Harika pulls Kawaki back towards their team with her kikaichū. Konashi continues to lurk around Kae. Soul and Harika complain about Kawaki not contributing, so Harika takes over as leader. They hand his curry, and tell him to focus on the afternoon tests. While cleaning up, Kae splits off from the group, so Himawari asks for Kawaki's help. Mimi gives Himawari directions she saw Kae take, and reminds her of Hana's warning about going deep into the forest. Kawaki finds Konashi blaming himself for something relating to Kae. Kae waits by a big tree, with a noting asking her to meet her for advice. Himawari finds her, but she's not the one who asked Kae to meet. Konashi was the one who asked her to meet, but fled when coming across a flame bear. He wanted to ask her opinion on his sweets for an upcoming competition, his family owning a sweets shop for generations, but was too shy to ask in front of everyone. Himawari and Kae run from the bear, and Hana acts as a decoy for them to escape, distracting the bear and attacking it with her Wind Release. Kawaki and Konashi finds Himawari and Kae, who inform them that Hana is fighting the bear. The bear's flames overcome Hana's Wind Release, and Kawaki arrives in time to kick the bear off of her, defeating it with one punch. He admonishes Hana for being unable to defeat the bear, and Konashi becomes star-struck by Kawaki, inspirited not to be embarrassed anymore. Meeting up with Kae's team, Konashi apologises for not showing up, and asks about his sweets. Kae gives them a positive critique. Soul and Harika overhear that Kawaki faced something head-on, and criticise him for always bailing on them. During the afternoon tests, Kawaki outperforms everyone else, changing his team-mates opinion of him. At the end of the day, Kae's team is the one with most points. Himawari is sad she didn't make a good team with Kawaki, but he concedes she did protect Kae. He instead complains about Hana. Konashi begins looking up to Kawaki.\\n\"},\n",

Kawaki isn't concerned, as jōnin watch Kae outside the Academy. Himawari tries talking to Osuka and Neon, but Osuka rebukes her. Two masked men watch them through the window. Neon apologises to Himawari, who doesn't mind. Neon's mother picks her up at the Academy. She and Osuka greet each other. She asks Osuka about her mother, but Osuka is unable to answer, Neon's mother believing Hibari is busy as usual. Osuka refuses her offer to walk her home. Himawari asks about Osuka and her mother, and apologises when it startles her. The masked men kidnap them, a sunflower pendant being left behind. The kidnappers argue about grabbing Himawari in addition to Osuka, and how that complicates ransoming her. Osuka doesn't believe her mother would pay a ransom. Their leader shows up. While leaving the Academy, Kawaki meets with Batora and Kae, who came looking for Himawari when she didn't show up. Kawaki finds it strange, and notices Himawari's pendant on the floor. He recalls that Himawari was with Osuka and Neon that time he saw her. Batora knows where Osuka lives, having researched places outside the Academy that Kae might visit. Aniki beats them up for getting an extra hostage. Himawari can tell that Aniki is a shinobi, and is confident he'll be found out, remaining calm. Aniki recognises her as the Seventh Hokage's daughter, and having delivered a ransom note to Osuka's residence, decides to sell Himawari to someone who has a grudge against the Hokage. Kawaki, Kae, and Batora arrive at Osuka's residence, where the servants read the ransom note. Kawaki snatches it, letting Kae read it. They realise Himawari might have been kidnapped alongside Osuka. Kae wants to check on Neon, and they tell Osuka's servants to contact her parents, who are on set of a new production. Himawari asks Osuka about her mother again, and Osuka says she doesn't care about her anymore, but refuses to elaborate. The kidnappers are concerned about capital punishment for kidnapping Himawari, but she assures them that Naruto wouldn't do that, and might forgive them if they apologise. They explain that they turned to crime because they can't eat, having failed out of the Academy and not lasting in any job. Aniki, who was a genin who ditched a mission he disagreed with, took them in. Aniki attacks a crate behind them, chastising them for giving up so much information, and telling Himawari to give up hope, as they're somewhere people rarely go. At Neon's home, they explain that Himawari and Osuka were likely kidnapped right after parting with her. Neon knew to leave her be when she was upset about her mother, who is an old friend of Neon's mother. Neon was asked to stay with Osuka so she wouldn't lonely over Hibari always being busy with work, but is actually friends with Osuka. Neon has an idea on how to find them. The kidnappers doze off, and Himawari convinces Osuka to attempt an escape. Himawari attacks Aniki, while Osuka ties the other kidnapper's legs. Aniki resists her attacks, and the kidnappers attempt to talk him down on hurting her. Osuka begs him to let Himawari go, reminding him she's the one he wants. Kawaki breaks through the ceiling, recovering the girls. Neon, Kae, and Batora catch up. Aniki creates a Fire Release wall around himself and Kawaki, and attacks him. Kawaki is unhurt by the Fire Release, and knocks him out. As the police work the scene, Kawaki returns Himawari's pendant. Himawari checks in on the other two kidnappers, and they ask about her injuries. She remains optimistic about them. Neon explains to Osuka she found them with her drone, and Hibari arrives to check in on her daughter, surprising her. Osuka thought she didn't care because she threw out something that was special to her. Neon explain that their mothers worked together to develop a sensing function for the drone, based on the Yamanaka clan's jutsu, to find her. Osuka and Hibari make up, the thing Hibari threw out being expired pudding. Hibari invites them all for pudding. Osuka apologises to everyone. Aniki curses his situation and at an unspecified superior who put him up to it. Meanwhile, a hooded individual is hidden in the trees while observing on Kae.\\n\"},\n",

Kae, who plays Tsunade, is excited about it. Osuka, who's playing Orochimaru, feels she is better suited to play the Fourth Hokage, who everyone picked Himawari to play over being his granddaughter. Himawari praises Osuka's Orochimaru performance. To make their performances more convincing, Osuka asks everyone to bring a mock forehead protector. As they leave the Academy, another Konoha shinobi takes over watching Kae. The next day, Sōsha publishes a story about Eiki reading one of Jiraiya's Icha Icha books to learn about his role. Embarrassed, Eiki rips the stories Sōsha handed out. Everyone puts on their forehead protectors, but Himawari forgot to bring one. Kawaki offers her his, but she refuses and tells him to hide it, as it could expose him as a genin, specially if Sōsha finds out. Eiki sees and overhears them, and tells Sōsha. They speculate the motive behind it, Eiki believing it to be nefarious. Sōsha asks about what proof he has, and Eiki shows a note sent to him anonymously, which is why he has kept a close eye on Kawaki. Sōsha needs more convincing proof, so Eiki tells her he'll get her Kawaki's forehead protector, and she hopes it's real so she can get a big scoop. After more rehearsals, Kawaki checks on Kae, who wonders why Orochimaru chose a path that lead away from his friends, herself wishing to stay with her friends in the Academy. Kawaki comforts her, and she gets excited to resume rehearsals. After she leaves, Kawaki addresses a hidden Eiki, admonishing for still being after Kae, and threatening to beat him up for real. Unable to steal the forehead protector through conventional means, he decides to take advantage of Kawaki's role of Katsuyu. Sōsha surprises Kawaki and Himawari, asking them about his forehead protector. They leave without answering, and join everyone else checking on the set, built primarily by Neon with everyone's help. Sōsha brings her camera. In the rehearsal, Ehō takes over the Jiraiya role, previously playing Manda, at Eiki's request, which Kawaki finds unusual. As they fight as Manda and Katsuyu, Eiki makes Kawaki drop his forehead protector, but he manages to hide it before Sōsha can photograph it, realising they're working together. Eiki improvises and gets Osuka to help him, improvising a Summoning: Rashōmon. Eiki grabs the forehead protector, but stands on the half-finished set, causing it to collapse. Kawaki protects him and Kae, and Eiki rushes to to hand Sōsha the protector, but it turns out to be a mock one. Sōsha accuses him of trying to get to publish a fake story. Kawaki shows him how he destroyed the set. Eiki breaks down crying, as it wasn't his intent to ruin things for everyone. At Himawari's insistence, Kawaki reaches out to Eiki to fix the set, and is joined by Kae. Kawaki notices his actual forehead protector is still missing. Everyone helps fixing the set, Kawaki and Himawari stay late looking for his forehead protector. Osuka hands it to them, having looked out for them after overhearing Eiki and Sōsha, switching it out during the improvised Rashōmon summoning. Osuka claims it's to repay for helping when she was kidnapped, suspecting he had to re-enrol due to bad behaviour. After they leave, Eiki approaches them to apologise again, and shows them the note he received, claiming that Kawaki is a shinobi with a secret that would get him expelled, now believing it to be a prank. Kawaki wonders who would want him expelled, and rushes to see Kae in the infirmary. Two Land of Bamboo officials discuss the country's succession, Kae's father plan to formally announce her as heir going against their plan to have her younger brother crowned. They decide to deploy an assassin. Kawaki reaches Kae just in time to stop an attempt, and the assassin escapes.\\n\"},\n",

Back in the Jiraiya role, Eiki promises Kae to make up for earlier. Kawaki speculates that whoever tipped Eiki knows he's guarding Kae, and wonders if they also infiltrated the Academy. Himawari asks him about what happened in the infirmary, but he brushes it off, feeling the situation has gotten too dangerous for her to be involved. Teams 7, 10, 5, and 15 attend the Academy festival. Teams 7 and 10 are interested seeing Kawaki in the play, having heard he's playing a slug. Hana feels unwell, and agrees with Ehō's suggestion that she should rest in the infirmary. Kawaki remains concerned.  Chōchō praises Konashi's sweets, and offers criticism for improvement. Ran Sōgi and Suzu made use of their experience with the Seven Mysteries to make an effective haunted house attraction, which thoroughly scares Team 5. Neon and Harika comment on their use of drones and insects, and Denki promises to put in a good word about developing those technologies. At Mimi and Kura's booth, Boruto, Shikadai, Inojin, Sarada, and Tsubaki collect several prizes hitting targets with kunai, causing them to wonder if they should have banned shinobi from playing. Hibari finished all her scenes of the day early so she could watch Osuka's debut in the play. Sōsha takes their photo, preparing an album about the festival. Kawaki asks about Batora, but Kae says he had unavoidable business to attend, which Kawaki finds suspicious. Kawaki mistakes an attendee for the assassin he fended off. The assassin watches Kae in the festival from above. The start of the play is announced, and the audience take their seats. Kae is nervous because the play was a collective effort, and thanks Kawaki for helping her all along. An explosion is set off, and an anonymous note is delivered to the Academy. Until safety can be verified, everyone is to remain on Academy grounds. Academy staff discuss the threat, which includes detonating more bombs if anyone tries to leave or contact the outside. The former students offer to help deal with the situation. Kawaki wonders if the attack is a diversion to target Kae. Osuka decides to obey and stay put, while Eiki and Ehō decide to help out. Inojin flies on a drawing, directing the shinobi to where there are explosive tags to be disarmed. Shino targets them through the ventilation system with his kikaichū. Eiki and Ehō find an explosive tag circuit behind the school building. Eiki stays behind to try defusing them while Ehō rushes back to warn the students. Kawaki decides to go help Eiki, and tells Himawari to keep an eye on Kae. Eiki manages to defuse most of the circuit, but the main explosive tag has already started to burn. Kawaki removes it, and uses a shadow clone to take it as far above the building as he can, so it detonates without harming anyone. Inside the building, several smoke bombs go off, allowing an assassin to sneak near Kae. Recalling Kawaki's order, Himawari activates her Byakugan, and seeing through the smoke, knocks the assassin aside. Outside, Himawari tells Kae there was someone going after her. The assassin catches up, but so does Kawaki. Kawaki gives chase, but the assassin throws several explosive tag kunai to cover their escape. Kawaki finds Hana among the explosion debris, and feels guilty she was hurt when going to look for them after they left. Kae realises she was the target by how her father was acting, and based on Kawaki's reaction, asks if he was guarding her.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Hana's class visits her in the hospital after her injury in the attack on the festival, and wish her a swift recovery. Because of her injuries, her memories of the assailant are hazy. Kawaki is admonished by Shikamaru, Sai, and Naruto about failing to report his suspicion of an assassin, and is taken off the mission. The search for the assassin continues, and Kae is likely to return to the Land of Bamboo. Shino and Anko discuss the incident, and decide not to tell Hana about Kae being the target. Kae is heavily guarded, and Batora informs that her father asked for her return. She misses her friends, and feels that Kawaki only got close to her for his mission. Kōtarō finishes interviewing Eiki, Kawaki, and Himawari about the incident. Himawari convinces Kawaki to keep protecting Kae, and continues to help herself, despite Kawaki finding it too dangerous for her. They decide to rely on Eiki for information, keeping that Kae was the target a secret. From what Eiki gathered, they have an idea where the culprit might have been, so they decide to look through Sōsha's photos. Batora tells Kae that Kawaki was likely forbidden from telling anyone about his mission, and speculates that he failed to report the assassin so as to prevent the festival Kae was looking forward to from being cancelled. Kae wants to ask him herself. Sōsha finds it strange that those three are working together, but relents when Eiki claims he's looking for a girl he has crush on. Looking through the photos, Himawari spots Batora on one of them, which is strange as he said he couldn't attend the festival. They keep it from Eiki and rush out, as Kae is with Batora. Kae finishes a letter, and the lights go out. Batora arrives at her room. Kawaki and Himawari arrive to find the Konoha guards knocked out. Kawaki spots Batora with a kunai, and breaks through the window. Batora has an injury caused the assassin. Kawaki chases the assassin, while Himawari protects Kae. The assassin attacks Kawaki with dark flames that chase him around. He dodges them, and beats the assassin down. Before he can discover their identity, the assassin reveals explosive tags around their body, and detonates them. After the police process the scene, Kōtarō asks Kawaki about his presence, and he claims he was visiting a friend. He'll report this to the Hokage's office. Kawaki checks on Kae, who's bandaging Batora. He asks why he was at the festival, and he says he was investigating someone suspicious who might have sneaked into the village. He lost track of them at the Academy. Batora feels indebted to Kae's father for taking him in. Batora and Himawari point out Kawaki's concern for Kae on what he does and does not do. The next day, Eiki asks about where they went, and Sōsha publishes a story about Eiki's new crush. Naruto reports that they'll overlook Kawaki's failure on account of his protecting Kae, though her father has withdrawn the mission, the plot's mastermind having been arrested back at the Land of Bamboo, after communications were discovered based on evidence Batora uncovered. It was the minister and guardian of Kae's younger stepbrother. They seemingly got into Konoha around the same time Kae arrived. The Land of Bamboo wants Konoha to send them all the information to avoid other nations learning of their infighting. Kawaki, however, finds it all too convenient.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Kawaki thinks about how the assassination plot played out. He accompanies Himawari to the Academy, despite being taken off his mission to protect Kae. Hana also returns, and discusses the attack with Anko and Shino, having learned Kae might have been the target. Osuka coordinates the class in welcoming Hana back. Kawaki messes up the release of flower petals for a surprise, Hana thanks them for caring about her and apologises for her shortcomings as their teacher. At the end of the day, Hana recalls what Shino and Anko told her of the assassination plot against Kae, and checking on the places she was during the festival, feels guilty about never perceiving the danger. She struggles to remember what she was doing and how she got caught in the blast. Kawaki arrives, and Hana recovers memories of fighting him and being the assassin after Kae. She excuses herself, and recovers more memories of fighting Kawaki. Hana rummages through her apartment, and discovers a hidden room with the assassin's belongings. Realising the truth, she decides to turn herself in, but her alter, speaking to her through her reflection won't allow it. Hana's alter recalls her that she is a Land of Bamboo orphan raised by its minister as a personal assassin, the one remaining of a group of around 50, having had to kill her friends in the training process. Her desire to survive clashed so much with her desire against killing that her mind split. As the survivor, she was assigned the mission by the Bamboo minister, who has sent agents like her to various countries, her desire to be a teacher actually an order by the minister her alter caused her to want. Hana's alter was responsible for the kidnapping, wanting to gauge Kawaki's strength. She used an associate's corpse to fake the assassin being killed during the attack. After all her trouble, Hana's alter won't let her turn herself in now that the matter is considered closed, and she is firmly established as a teacher who cares deeply about her students. Hana's alter takes over, and she wakes up. Himawari calls Kawaki for dinner, and he reveals his intent to keep investigating, finding it strange that the assassin had set up the explosive tags on themselves, anticipating defeat, when having fought them, Kawaki found them incredibly skilled. At class the next day, Hana's alter passes as her, discreetly discarding the petals her student's gave her alongside a butterfly that flew by her. Kawaki notices it. Hana stops her alter from attacking Kae, who is being accompanied home by Kawaki and Himawari. Hana's alter berates her. At Kae's home, Kawaki investigates where the assassin broke through, before being called for tea and cookies.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Hana takes her students for an outside class on an uninhabited island that used to be part of the village's training grounds, including spending a night on it. She warns them to be careful of the unmaintained island. The students thank her for arranging it to make up for the festival. Mimi's ninken Kikuchiyo gets hurt on a trap. Sōsha heard a rumour that the island is a home of a killer missing-nin, worrying everyone. Kawaki is suspicious that the trap isn't old, and that people on the island wouldn't manage to stay hidden for long. Hana says that the island has a history of people escaping to it, some not even knowing the war is over. Their food is suddenly gone as well, and the ship will only return to them the next day. Hana blames herself, but Himawari assures her they can manage. Everyone starts setting up tents and looking for food. Kawaki is still bothered by the trap. Hana finds them lucky, and would have killed them all if she didn't still have a mission. Osuka finds a game trail leading to edible wild plants, making use of what she learned when she lived in a mountain with her mother for a movie. Kae makes a flower arrangement for Hana. Kawaki wants her to stay close, and she asks if he's still guarding her, as the matter of her assassin is over. When they get startled by some movement, Osuka and Himawari have Neon check it with her drone, but it gets taken down. They ask for help, and Soul finds it. Neon finds it unlikely to have malfunctioned, having recently serviced it. They worry about missing-nin. Hana watches them, hidden. Kae gifts Hana the flower arrangement. Himawari calls her and everyone is informed about the drone incident. Doseki and Soul want to search the island, having a numbers advantage, but Kawaki points out that with the ninken and the drone out, they can't search far, as Harika's kikaichū also can't search too wide an area. Hana tries calming everyone, and Kawaki stresses they must stay close together and in line of sight. At night, everyone eats. Kawaki checks on the trap, and tells Kae that according to Mimi, it was baited with Kikuchiyo's food, meaning he was the target from the start. Kae thanks for still watching over her, and he admits that going to the Academy has been fun as well. Kae has had fun as well, and reveals she'll return to the Land of Bamboo after this extra curricular class. Konashi gives Kae his latest sweet, and pulls Kawaki away to try some as well. Hana approaches her, who notices the flower arrangement is gone, and offers to help Hana look for it. Kawaki asks Himawari about the damage to the drone, and she found that its blades were cleanly sliced, and the drone too damaged for the height from which it fell. Himawari recalls that the drone has recording capabilities, so they have Neon play it to review the footage. Kawaki notices something and calls Himawari aside. He saw Wind Release flower petals on the corner of the screen before the footage cut off, and they realise it implicates Hana. They don't want to believe it, but too many things fit the theory. Himawari finds the flower arrangement Kae made discarded. Hana tries getting Kae further away from the group to find the gift, but Kawaki and Himawari stop them, wanting to ask questions. Hana sets off a smoke bomb and runs away with Kae. Hana fights Kawaki and Himawari, who thinks someone switched places with her. She pushes them away with her Wind Release, and rushes to a bridge, where she seemingly slashes Kae with a kunai, to Kawaki and Himawari's horror.\\n\"},\n",

Despite Kawaki's assertions, Himawari refuses to believe Hana was deceiving them the whole time. The rest of the class arrives, drawn by the noise, and Kawaki tells them that Hana killed Kae. The class is in disbelief. Kawaki wants to pursue Hana, and tells his class-mates to leave. Himawari believes Kae might still be alive, questioning why Hana would do what she did in front of them. The other students point out that without Kikuchiyo and Neon's drone, they wouldn't be able to search for them. Osuka suggests Hana actually means to use Kae as a hostage. Himawari attempts to look for them with her Byakugan, but doesn't have enough stamina left. Despite the danger, the class wants to save Kae. Hidden in a cave, Kae struggles against her restraints and asks Hana why she's doing it. She tells Kae she's meeting associates, and orders her to be quiet. Kae tries convincing Hana to go back, to no avail, Hana landing a kunai near head. Hana explains she was embedded in the village for missions like this. Tears well up in one of Assassin-Hana's eyes, and she determines Teacher-Hana is sad inside her. Instead of killing Kae, Hana is waiting for the imprisoned minister's subordinate to arrive by ship, they can return to the Land of Bamboo with Kae as a hostage. Kae is confident that Kawaki and the others will save her, but Hana doesn't think they can find her before the ship arrives. Kura produces a length of rope that Eiki is able to stretch over the destroyed bridge so everyone can cross. Kawaki thinks both he and Hana underestimated the students. Harika tries using kikaichū to gather information, but still can't control them over wide ranges. Sōsha recalls an article from the Academy newspaper about a couple who lived on the island, but doesn't recall the details. Kura has the article, having intended to read on her free time. From it, they discover Hana is likely to go to the west coast, so she can leave by boat. Konashi recognises the smell of the sweet he gave Kae, finding crumbs nearby, left as a trail by Kae, which Harika's kikaichū can follow. Kawaki doesn't know what to do with Hana when Himawari asks him about it. They find the cave where Kae is. Kawaki doesn't want the class to continue, and reveals he's a shinobi. The class thinks Kawaki finds them to be dead weight, but he assures them he made it this far because of them. Himawari follows Kawaki to the cave, reminding him she's his partner. The class is frustrated there's nothing they can do, but Eiki says there is something they can do. Kae uses the kunai Hana landed near her to cut through her restraints, and flees. Having left the kunai on purpose, Hana attacks Kae, surprised she actually tried to escape. She needs Kae as a hostage, but she can hurt her and break her spirit. Kae attempts to fight Hana anyway. Kawaki and Himawari arrive, Kawaki telling Hana his classmates helped find her.\\n\"},\n",

Himawari asks if she's really not their teacher, and Hana explains that was a separate personality she used as a cover for her mission. Kae corroborates it. Hana attacks them with Fire Release. Kawaki and Himawari retreat, dodging the fireballs. Hana says she risked everything for this mission for a decade, hiding within the weak Hana, and won't let them get in the way. Kawaki can't hold back, but Himawari points out that if he kills her, Teacher Hana will die as well. Hana claims that the teacher is as good as dead, sealed deep within her. Kawaki has to prioritise defeating her and saving Kae. Hana targets them with her dark fireballs again, Kawaki rushing to protect Himawari. Hana converges the fireballs on them. Kawaki falls to the ground, but disperses as a shadow clone. Hana deflects a Gentle Fist attack from Himawari, and Kawaki causes her to drop an explosive tag kunai near Kae. Assassin Hana talks like Teacher Hana to stop Kawaki from landing a hit on her, and counterattacks. Hana creates a paper barrier, obscuring her movements and where she attacks from, and prepares to end them. Eiki leads the rest of the class towards the harbour, hoping to get word of the developments out. Someone appears in front of them. Kae reasons that Hana shouldn't have enough chakra to main such a taxing jutsu for long. Hana reveals that more jōnin level allies should be arriving by boat, which will allow her to overpower them soon without Konoha ever learning a thing. Kawaki tells Himawari she can see where Hana is with her Byakugan, reminding her she's his partner. Encouraged by his words, they fist bump. Kawaki blocks Hana's attacks on Himawari with his body while she looks for Hana. Kae throws the explosive tag kunai at one of the fireballs, exploding it and opening a whole through the barrier, briefly exposing Hana before it reforms. Himawari keeps track of Hana's position outside and opens a new hole with her Gentle Fist, allowing Kawaki to kick her. Hana reforms the barrier, but the children break through again, defeating her, and dispelling the barrier. Hana says it doesn't matter, as her allies have had time to arrive. The rest of the class hails them, having brought Sai and Batora along, who reveals Hana's allies have been caught by Anbu. Defeated, Assassin Hana tries killing herself, but her exhaustion allows Teacher Hana to fight her. The students call out to their teacher, giving her the strength to get in control again. The class rejoices. Later, Kawaki, Sai, and Shikamaru report to Naruto. In the hospital, Hana talks to Shino, Anko, and Sakura, having decided to use fūinjutsu to suppress Assassin Hana until she can teach her to do more than live for her mission. Shikamaru finds it risky, but Naruto respects her wishes, hoping they might come to an understanding. Kae wants to keep the incident under wraps, and is scheduled to return home. She says goodbye to her class-mates, explaining her father has taken ill, necessitating her to step up in ruling and look after her brother. The class wants to finish the play they rehearsed, but Kawaki is no longer there to play Katsuyu. They arrange for Neon's drone to act as Katsuyu, but Kawaki arrives in time to play the part. The students and Hana see Kae off at the train station, except for Kawaki. She waves at them from the back of the train, and spots Kawaki by himself on a railing. She wishes him good luck on his missions, and thanks him for their time together. Later, Himawari goes off to the Academy, her parents noting how engrossed by it she's become.

She advises Sarada to get used to Sasuke leaving and returning suddenly. On the train, Sasuke explains the type of hawk he's after, tended to by a man named Maruta. Another passenger informs them that a detour will be required because of a recent landslide. Sasuke and Boruto hop off the train, continuing their journey on foot. Near a structure with extravagant buildings, the two are accosted by a security officer with a wolf, who finds them suspicious. Sasuke claims they're just passing through, and they leave. They arrive at Maruta's research facility, where he initially attacks them, confusing them for Paradise representatives, whose leader Mozu Shitakiri deals in exotic and endangered animals. They've began threatening him to learn about the Thousand Mile Hawk's habitat, and can't risk them finding out about it by tailing them if he takes Sasuke and Boruto there. Sasuke wants to investigate, and enters Paradise claiming to be a customer. Mozu initially intends to send them away, but changes her mind when Boruto recognises Tentō in a photo. She takes them to see their pens, and berates her son, who took it upon himself to clean the stables when no one else would, for showing up filthy in front of customers. When Sasuke asks about their security, Mozu demonstrates their security system, confident in its ability to stop thieves. When Mozu explains an empty cage is for a Thousand Mile Hawk she means to acquire, Boruto accuses her of threatening Maruta. Realising they're not customers, she tells them to send Maruta a veiled threat on her behalf. Sasuke is worried about Boruto wanting to meddle. Mozu tells the security officer to deal with the shinobi. At night, Maruta takes Sasuke, who throws the security officer following them off their trail with crows, to the habitat. In the morning, Boruto spots Tsuzura training a white hawk. He introduces himself, and Tsuzura explains that Yuki trusts him because they've been together since she was young, but captivity made it hard for her to get food on her own, so he takes her out to get her used to it. Boruto helps by stirring up critters for Yuki to hunt. Yuki doesn't fly well because of an injury sustained when she fell from her nest. Boruto gets a book on hawks from Maruta's research facility so Tsuzura can learn, but his mother never thought him to read, so Boruto reads it for him. Mozu wants him to take over the business, but he dislikes how she treats the animals. Boruto relates to feeling pressure over a parent's job. Boruto decides to teach Tsuzura to read. He asks his mother to go to school, but she finds it too expensive, and they'd teach him things she feels he doesn't need to know. Mozu sends him to his room. Tsuzura exchanges notes with Boruto through Yuki. Sasuke and Maruta arrive at the hawk habitat. Maruta has given them the necessary training, but they must accept Sasuke. One of the hawks immediately accepts Sasuke, landing on his arm, surprising Maruta. With Boruto's help, Tsuzura successfully has Yuki capture prey. Mozu arrives with the security officer, and blaming Boruto for giving Tsuzura ideas, takes Yuki away and decides to restrict his freedom even further. The security officer threats to arrest him, but Tsuzura deescalates the situation, leaving with his mother.\\n\"},\n",

Tsuzura doesn't care about an animal's rarity, and Mozu says this is because he hasn't experienced hardship, recounting how in her past, she was neglected until she discovered a marten thought to be extinct, which earned her recognition. She has since worn it around her neck, and hopes Tsuzura will one day understand their value. Sasuke and Maruta return with a new hawk, and are welcomed by Boruto. He tells Sasuke of what he has learned about Tsuzura and his home life, and wishes Tsuzura could have a say in his own life. Sasuke shares his opinion of Paradise, but is unwilling to interfere at the moment, thinking Tsuzura has to realise it on his own. The next day, Mozu keeps Tsuzura locked in his room, and tells him she found a client who wants to stuff and mount Yuki, to match his living room wall. Seeing Boruto's message on the paper, Tsuzura sneaks off to get Yuki. Sasuke notes Boruto's displeasure at leaving. They're approached by a subordinate of Yuki's buyer, asking for directions. Upon learning the buyer is a taxidermist, Boruto rushes out, followed by Sasuke. Mozu goes to check on Yuki, finding her gone, Tsuzura having taken her. She finds them on their way out, and threatens him to return Yuki. She has the security officer chase him with his wolf. Right outside Paradise, Boruto protects Tsuzura, and Sasuke intimidates the wolf. Mozu threatens Boruto with life in prison if he steps in Paradise again. Sasuke offers his Thousand Mile Hawk in exchange for Yuki, to Boruto's surprise. Mozu takes the deal, and is certain that Tsuzura will return after struggling in the real world. The security officer wants to see them to the train station to make sure they don't return. The Thousand Mile Hawk goes in distress. An employee wants to take care of the valuable bird, but Mozu orders to have it opened up, wishing to learn its stomach contents to determine its habitat. On his way out, Boruto tries to comfort Tsuzura, who concedes that his mother is right this is the only home he's ever known, pointing out how Sasuke gave up his hawk. Sasuke tells him not to worry about it. Sasuke's hawk recovers and escapes, Sasuke having used his Sharingan to command it to wreck havoc. The security officer recognises Sasuke's name when Boruto praises him. Mozu catches up, telling Tsuzura she'll forgive him if he brings her Sasuke's hawk. Tsuzura refuses to return home. Mozu threatens to destroy them with her connections, but the security officer, now aware of Sasuke's identity, tells her he's out of her league. The animals she kept escape. Tsuzura is concerned about his future, but Sasuke reassures him. Maruta takes on Tsuzura as an apprentice. Sasuke wants Boruto to return to Konoha by himself, so that his actions against Mozu don't reflect on the village. He already meant to leave to look for Kara's last member, Code. He says Sarada will understand when Boruto asks if she knows, and Boruto reiterates his desire to become a shinobi like him. On the train, Boruto struggles with a stuck window, and is helped by an Iwa shinobi. A man rushes to get on the train before it departs. When everyone is asleep, the train changes course.

Anaguma points him to a Fire Release user, who has been trying to break out for a while with no result, and accidentally hits Shamo, an Iwa shinobi as he approaches. Boruto checks on him, and Kiseru recognises Boruto, also a Konoha shinobi and an acquaintance of Konohamaru. A girl asks about Anaguma's bounty, Rokuro, who she thinks smells of blood. Anaguma tells her to be careful. An old man arrives, congratulating them on surviving, claiming that a drug storage facility along the tracks of their Thunder Train exploded, exposing them to toxic gas, requiring them to be taken to a containment facility in case they were contaminated. A Kumo kunoichi has no recollection of it, but the old man blames it on the gas, claiming that many passengers died over inhaling too much of the gas. Before letting them go, the man wants them to go through a test, believing that the choices they just happened to make that allowed to survive were not coincidences, but a subconscious ability to avoid death. He wishes to test that ability, and offers a card-drawing test. Kiseru feels confident, but Boruto finds it suspicious. Another Kiri bounty hunter draws a death card, and is killed by the old man with a blade extending from his finger. Boruto attacks the old man with Wind Release: Gale Palm. Kiseru calls Boruto to inspect the old man, revealed to be a puppet. Ōga introduces himself as the lord of the maze, and explains that the experiment isn't a game, and his is an underground maze unknown to all but him. He ignores Boruto's admonishment and proceeds explaining there will be five experiments, detailed in scrolls he presents them. If they don't pass all the experiments, they'll never leave the maze. A Kusa shinobi complains about it, knocking over one of the scrolls, selecting an experiment by accident. The scrolls summons them to a different location. The Kumo kunoichi wants a civilian to spend what she presumes to be money he has on a briefcase he's holding tightly to hire her, finding him unlikely to survive on his own. Kiseru criticises the Kusa shinobi, who pushes him back. Boruto stops Shamo from falling when the stone floor near the edge of the platform they're on collapses. Yatsume introduces herself to Boruto. Another section of the floor collapses near an old man. Ōga explains they have to leave the brittle platform and reach another platform above them. Boruto and Kiseru rush and attempt to attack Ōga, but he disappears. The brittle platform continues to collapse, and the man with the briefcase accepts help from the Kumo kunoichi, who uses a powerful Wind Release to lift them to the firm platform. A participant warns her that such a strong jutsu will collapse the platform, and she is unbothered by his accusation of caring only for herself. The Kusa shinobi also jumps to safety. The platform continues to collapse, some participants falling. Anaguma attempts to hold it together with Water Release threads. Rokuro says he won't be able to hold it alone. Yatsume is exasperated when Boruto jumps back down to help the old man, while the Kumo kunoichi finds him naive. Kiseru uses the firm platform's fence to make a rope ladder for everyone else to climb, but can only support one person at once. Shamo helps a young girl who sprained her ankle. Anaguma warns Boruto his jutsu won't hold for long. A man loses his patience when the platform continues to give while an old couple takes too long to climb. The rest of the threads give away, throwing Anaguma off the edge. Rokuro holds him with his legs, and asks civilian Kakesu to tap Anaguma's keys on his cuff to release him so he can use his jutsu to save her. Anaguma urges her not to trust him. She releases Rokuro, who lets Anaguma fall, and ignores Kakesu when the floor under her collapses. He has a bladed arm. The man and the old man fall as more of the platform collapses. Boruto asks Namua to help a woman, while he carries the girl with the sprained ankle. Shamo asks for help as Boruto reaches the top. Boruto manages to grab him as the rest of the platform collapses and Boruto Streams himself and Shamo up, Yatsume grabbing them at the bottom of the ladder. Ōga allows them to rest before the next experiment, and they return to original room. Boruto criticises Rokuro for sacrificing Anaguma, but he's determined to survive, even at the expense of everyone else. The Kumo kunoichi notes there were 14 survivors. Boruto wants to survive to capture Ōga.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"The captives wait for Ōga to announce the next experiment. A few complain of thirst, Fugō trying in vain to exchange his luxury watch for another captive's water. The Kusa-nin agrees with Boruto that they need to cooperate to survive. Batta continues to only care about getting payed, and Yatsume finds merit in both approaches, asking Rokuro's opinion. He thinks they need a strong will to survive throws a parasite on the Kusa-nin to force him to confess, accusing him of being Ōga's minion, as he activated the first experiment, and avoided the platform edges before they started crumbling. He grabs another captive and asks for Ōga's help before perishing. Rokuro picks another scroll, finding it useless to hesitate. It takes them do a dark room, where a candle lights up on its own when Yatsume grabs it. They all grab candles, which also light up. They're supposed to reach a goal, avoiding many traps, without letting their flame die. An older captive sneezes, blowing out his candle, and dies. Ōga explains the candle flame is their life, showing them lanterns to carry them. He adds how passing the candles from person to person works, the person not holding a candle dying if one goes out on someone else's hand. The candle belongs to whoever holds it. Sarada and Mitsuki look for the Thunder Train Boruto disappeared on, asking the company's staff about it. The Department of Prisons also made inquiries, and the employee working that day suddenly quit and went away. A train employee spies on them as they discuss Boruto's disappearance. They hear a snap and find money on the floor. The suspicious employee escapes, but later despairs at what he got involved in. The captives have to wade through water, Batta, Fugō, and Rokuro going first. Shamo carries a girl he likes on his arms. They reach a closing gate that requires both hands for raising. Kiseru is concerned Ōga has other minions among them. Batta is interested in the commotion, and offers to carry Fugō's briefcase so he can hold his lantern with both hands, promising not to steal it, but he refuses. Boruto trusts Yatsume with his lantern, but is unable to raise the gate until Kiseru and Namua help him. Yatsume finds him odd. They reach a desert like area where trash is being burned, where fans begin blowing a dust storm. Boruto has the non-shinobi hold the candles, while the shinobi form a shield. Shamo creates an earth wall, but it's too weak and crumbles at Boruto's touch. They protect the non-shinobi from the storm with their bodies. When it passes, they're all alive. An old lady offers Boruto her water as thanks. He notices that Shamo and the girl with him aren't around, Kiseru saying they went ahead. Shamo helps her up a wall, but she leaves him behind as another dust storm kicks up around him. The old lady dies, her candle having melted completely. The heat of the area melted her candle, making it go out. They find Shamo abandoned as they reach the end, and catch up with the others, the girl now clinging to Rokuro. Ōga appears and offers a bonus stage, claiming that the elevator the first group is on will take them to the goal, but only has two more spots on it. Two civilians rush to fill it, and it closes. The others go into the second elevator. They notice it is moving too slowly, and the candles will be used up before they reach the top. Kiseru realises that the candle holding rules mean that taking and preserving stolen candles will increase their remaining time, but others would have to die. On the other elevator, Rokuro blows out the girl's candle, taking it for himself. Fugō wants Batta to steal the other civilians' candles so they can last. She hands him her lantern and makes their way to them. Boruto notices melted wax on the floor from his and Yatsume's candle. He recalls the rule that the candle belongs to whoever holds it, and suggests making one long candle they all hold on to. From the first elevator, only Rokuro, Batta, and Fugō came out alive. Batta is shaken, with blood on her hand holding a candle. When everyone from the second elevator appears alive, Ōga is amused by their ingenuity, and they're all transported back to the waiting room. Mitsuki and Sarada chase the train employee, and find where the Thunder Train changed tracks. He screams that the passengers became part of experiments, and runs into the tunnel, triggering explosive tags which collapse the tunnel on top of him, to Sarada's and Mitsuki's shock.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'While waiting for the next experiment, Batta struggles with having killed civilians for hers and Fugō\\'s survival, and rebuffs Yatsume\\'s attempt to comfort her. She also clashes with Shamo, and chides Boruto when he tries convincing her of the importance of cooperation. Kiseru doesn\\'t judge her, but warns against trying anything against him, showing off his Fire Release. She mocks him for showing his hand, Namua and Boruto having to calm him down. Yatsume shares her dream of finally changing her hair colour if she survives, and asks for others dreams. Boruto wants to emulate his master. Shamo wants to make his grandmother happy. Namua has no dreams, and Rokuro recognises the tattoo on his arm as a prison tattoo. Namua recounts his criminal past, having killed and stolen so much he became paranoid about becoming the next victim. He changed his life after meeting a priest he couldn\\'t bring himself to kill, becoming an ascetic. Fugō wants to deliver a payment to his client, his company\\'s fate at stake. Batta refuses to share her story, but Yatsume notes her use of \"need\" instead of \"want\" when she mentions money, so she claims she needs money to buy a beach island. Kiseru wants to soak on hot spring on his mountain village, near the border with Takigakure. Ōga arrives, and Kiseru picks the next experiment, \"Pressure\", which Ōga finds the harshest yet. Sarada returns to Konoha, meeting with Kawaki, Mitsuki having stayed behind to investigate the scene. She is investigating everyone who bought tickets to the same Thunder Train to see if anyone suspicious was aboard with Boruto. Namua finds bloodstains on the experiment room, agitating Shamo, which irritates Kiseru. Shamo finds and presses a switch causing the ceiling to come down on them. Yatsume readily tries blocking it with her Lightning Release chains, but they break. Boruto\\'s Rasengan also has no effect. Rokuro asks what Shamo did, and he explains he tried turning on the lights. Boruto notices other switches on other walls, but each one pressed makes the situation worse, causing moving saws and spikes to appear. One of them retracts the saws, but the ceiling spikes remain. Batta and Fugō argue against pressing the last switch, but taking Ōga\\'s behaviour in consideration, Boruto thinks he wouldn\\'t end them like this, and presses it. Depressions appear on the walls, where they can hide from the ceiling spikes. Fugō overtakes Shamo, Rokuro fights Kiseru, Boruto lets Yatsume have one spot, as thanks for saving him in the first experiment and because she injured herself when her jutsu failed to stop the ceiling. Namua observes the ceiling. Kiseru\\'s Fire Release endangers the others, but Boruto puts it out with his Water Release. He notices the water drains away, and determines there must be space below the floor. Boruto and Kiseru try breaking through the floor, while Shame tries holding the ceiling with his earth wall. Namua joins Boruto and Kiseru. Batta needs to kill Yatsume to take her spot, who wants to know the reason for her death if Batta indeed kills her. Batta confesses she needs the money to buy back her birthplace from rich people who bought it for resort development. Boruto convinces her to help by arguing it\\'ll go against playing into Ōga\\'s hand. She helps Boruto find the weakest spot on the floor for Boruto to strike, comparing it to diamond cutting. The extra space is enough so no one dies from the ceiling coming down. Ōga congratulates Boruto, as it\\'ll make the next experiment more interesting, and lets them return to the break room. Batta bumps into Kiseru as he leaves. Fugō checks on his briefcase contents, not money, but a family photo and a canteen. Batta confides in Boruto that Ōga might have another minion among them, revealing a working communication device she swiped from someone else, who kept it hidden instead of trying to use to contact anyone outside. He is surprised when she whispers who had it. Sarada discovered five passengers with unclear backgrounds, and comparing it to Konoha\\'s records, she and Kawaki discover one of them was a Kara Outer, Kiseru.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': 'Boruto is surprised when Batta accuses Kiseru of working for Ōga. She explains that her home village is near Kiseru\\'s alleged home, and that his claim of watching sunsets on hot springs is impossible because they all face east, allowing only sunrises. His claim made her suspicious, so she searched him and found the communication device. In the waiting room, Yatsume, Kiseru, and Shamo note how Boruto and Batta are taking their time coming back, and wonder if they\\'re plotting. Batta believes that Kiseru has been receiving instructions to keep the experiments running smoothly, and points out they already found an underling before. Boruto remains sceptical, as Kiseru was the first to help him try breaking through the floor. Batta says she\\'ll remain on guard. Kawaki is surprised Konoha has that much information on an Outer, but Sarada points out their information is likely incomplete, and that they\\'re important clues about Code. They rush to meet up with Mitsuki. When Batta and Boruto return, Ōga complains about them being late, the next experiment has already been picked, \"Calculation\". Everyone had to pick an envelope, Shamo picking theirs for them. Ōga sends them to the next experiment, everyone scattered, with cards having numbers 1 to 8, and they have to steal each others\\' cards until they add up at least to 7, the ones who already have enough points being lucky, but also more likely to be targeted. They have a two hour limit to gather points and reach a gate indicated by a flare. Other flares will be sent to indicate one hour, and ten minutes remaining. Boruto has 6, Rokuro has 1. Batta finds Fugō, who has 2, revealing she has 3. She wants to target Shamo, perceiving him as the weakest, who celebrates having 8. He shows it to Boruto, who admonishes him for his carelessness. Kiseru has 7, and decides to contact someone, but realises his communication device is gone, and that Batta took it when she bumped on him. Fugō finds it strange Batta is still protecting him, despite her hate for the wealthy. She claims not to let personal feelings interfere with her mission. When he trips, she picks up his briefcase to return it to him, and finds it suspiciously light. Noting she never actually saw the money, the two fight over it, its contents falling out. The canteen breaks, something gaseous escaping it. She demands an explanation. Fugō reveals his company is being threatened by an organisation, who have taken his wive and child hostage for ransom. However, his company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and he intended to threaten the organisation with the chemical on the canteen. She finds him just another liar, and takes his card, while he begs for her help. She tells him to pay him, and someone kills him with a kunai to the back. She is surprised by the assailant, who also attacks her. Yatsume has 4, and meets up with Namua, who has done the math, determining five people can have 7 or more points, meaning three people will fail. He offers her his 5 card, but she doesn\\'t want it. Namua doesn\\'t want to take things anymore, still hearing the voices of those he killed, and has trouble sleeping. Boruto and Shamo join up with them, and they check to see how many would pass with their cards. Shamo suggests turning Boruto\\'s 6 into a 9, but he doesn\\'t think it would work. They decide to look for the others, and find Batta and Fugō dead on the ground, their cards and the device she took for Kiseru stolen. Namua thinks either Rokuro or Kiseru did it, while Boruto thinks it might be a trap to sow discord among them. Shamo wishes he could give them one of his points, giving Boruto the idea of exchanging his 6 card for the 1, 2, and 3, so more people could get 7 points. The one hour flare goes up. Rokuro finds them, revealing he has cards 1, 2, and 3. Boruto offers to exchange his 6 for 2 and 3, but Rokuro attacks him with his bladed arms, figuring that if only one person is left, Ōga will reach the goal of his experiment early, going beyond his expectations. He takes Shamo hostage, who offers him his 8. Boruto lands a Vanishing Rasengan, allowing Shamo to escape and Namua to land a blow. Sarada and Kawaki finds Mitsuki trapped by sealing tags, with more around to trap them if they interfere. Sarada wants to wait for backup, but Kawaki goes ahead and triggers the trap, waiting for it envelop him so he can burn through it by setting himself on fire, also freeing Mitsuki. He reveals he was attacked by a group of skilled shinobi. Sarada informs him there might be Outer involvement. Kawaki wants to go straight to the source, Sarada in agreement. Shamo realises that if they get Rokuro\\'s cards, them four can make through the experiment. Rokuro resists Boruto\\'s Lightning Release and infects Namua with his parasite, making him fight against the group. He tries resisting Rokuro\\'s control, who wishes Namua to revert to who he was before. Yatsume cries, touched by everyone\\'s desire to survive. Seeing the kindness of the priest\\'s eyes in Boruto, Namua manages to stop, and takes Rokuro\\'s attack aimed at Boruto, who instead lands his Rasengan on him, defeating Rokuro and taking his cards. Rokuro has no regrets, as if he had been taken back to his village, he would have served for life at best, and concedes that Boruto\\'s desire to survive was greater than his own. Boruto lets him have the 6 and 1 cards, and yells in defiance of Ōga\\'s goal. Rokuro reveals that while he took Batta and Fugō\\'s cards, they were already dead when he found them, leaving one possible culprit. Rokuro goes through the gate, and Boruto wants the others to go ahead, noting that the 7 card hasn\\'t been used, so he wants to wait for Kiseru, telling the others of Batta\\'s suspicion. Yatsume and Shamo help Namua through the gate. Kiseru arrives at the gate, finding Boruto waiting.\\n'},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"With the entire area set ablaze from the attack on Obito, Sasuke and Naruto watch, wondering if their attack was successful. Meanwhile, Tobirama teleports to Minato's side, noting that they had landed their attack before Obito could shield himself with the mysterious orbs. However, Obito emerges from the flames, unscathed as the orbs erase the black flames. As the two Hokage analyse the situation, Tobirama notes that Minato's arm should have regenerated by now, and comes to the conclusion that whatever Obito was doing involved the use of Yin–Yang rendering the regenerative abilities of the technique useless. As Naruto calls out to Sasuke noting they would have to lead the assault and attempts to go into Tailed Beast Mode. As a result, the mantle disappears altogether leading Tobirama to chide Naruto and Minato for not thinking. As Minato sheepishly apologises to the Second, they are all shocked when Gamakichi attacks Obito with the Starch Syrup Gun technique noting that the Summoning Technique was soon going to run out and he wanted to try something before he disappeared. As Obito deflects the attack under the shinobi's watchful eyes, Minato questions of his intentions lead Obito to decry the position of Hokage, leading Minato to blame the chain of events during the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack on his inability to recognise his own student. Naruto, however, tells the jinchūriki not to look down on the position because he was unable to acquire it, and — picking up on what was happening as Naruto formed a Rasengan — Tobirama teleports Naruto above Obito where he sends his attack crashing into Obito's back. Though Sasuke and Minato are shocked, Tobirama explains that it appeared that senjutsu was effective against Obito's form. As Minato notes that his son had become a sage like his own sensei, the silhouetted Yin half of Kurama notes that Naruto had grown up to be someone who loved his parents and had even persuaded his Yang-half to cooperate with him.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Boruto is incredulous that everything until now was genjutsu, and his legs give out, weak from disuse. Yatsume and Rokuro also wake up, Boruto confirming to Rokuro that Kiseru wasn't working for Ōga, but in fact investigating him. Something about the pain when Kiseru stabbed him was different, which he attributes to it being genjutsu. Rokuro speculates that the people who died in the genjutsu can't wake up, and doesn't believe they can beat Ōga in an unfamiliar location. Yatsume retrieves a map and access card from the Kusa-nin who worked for Ōga, which they use to leave the area and search for an exit. Yatsume falls down, dizzy. Rokuro doesn't want her dragging them down, and asks for the map. She refuses, thinking he wants to escape by himself, and carries own. They continued through abandoned rooms, and Rokuro notices them walking on the same puddle they did earlier, realising they're going in circles. A wall comes down, separating Boruto from the other two. Yatsume refuses giving the map to Rokuro again. Boruto fails to break through the wall with his Rasengan and tries to circle back. Yatsume prepares to attack with Lightning Release, Rokuro changes his arms into blades, and sends a parasite at her. Boruto arrives to find Yatsume defeated, and she tells him Rokuro took the map. He finds a closed gate and uses the access card to go through, finding an Ōga puppet, which attacks him. Boruto helps Yatsume walk. She tells him she paralysed the insect with Lightning Release, but he'll be in danger when it wears off. They reach a more open area, and the parasite begins taking over Yatsume, causing her to attack Boruto, slashing his leg. She asks him to end it before she loses control. He allows her to stab his hand, and from how the pain feels, determines they're still under genjutsu, so they can still be saved. The infection on Yatsume recedes, and her attitude changes, commenting on what she wanted to see Boruto do. Her appearance changes to a cloaked, long-haired version of herself, revealing herself as Ōga, using the old puppet as a distraction. He accuses her of killing Batta, which she admits she did to cast doubt on Kiseru so she could continue with the experiments. She wants to understand people's true desires, devising the scenarios to force people to act on them. She learned that desire is connected to one's life-force from someone who wanted to live so much he would steal others' bodies, but he was defeated anyway. Boruto realises she's talking about Jigen, and she reveals herself as Kara's eighth Inner, created by Amado. Boruto recognises their location as the place he saw when Amado was being interrogated. Because Kiseru almost broke her genjutsu, she had to quickly make a new one. Since they're still under it, Boruto asks about everyone else. She shows Boruto everyone in suspended animation, saying that she's not a combat type person, only her brain being augmented by Amado so she could assist his research on the human heart when he hit a dead end. She had to flee when she attempted to examine Jigen's heart, but before she could, he destroyed an important part of her body. It destroyed something in her heart, she no longer understands the reason for living, and her body began to whither. She thought that if she saw everyone trying so desperately to stay alive, it would restore her desire to live. She finds his desire different from others', and thinks she might have succeeded if he didn't figure it out. He finds her actions unforgivable, and she sits down, tired from talking so much. She explains that stabbing her will release the genjutsu and he will wake up. Ōga also asks him to remove a scroll she indicates on the screen, so everyone else will wake up. She compares the situation to the fifth experiment. He deduces that if he leaves, she has no way of waking up, hence her request. Ōga thinks it's too late for her. Boruto thinks she can wake up and remove the scroll herself, and offers to find her a reason to live. The world around begins to collapse. He runs around, trying to escape, pulling her along, and Boruto Streams himself carrying her through a gate. From the experiments, Ōga thinks that when desires collide, unhappiness follows, but Boruto says he doesn't live for desires, but for dreams, and tells her to find a dream that stirs her heart. The ground collapses under her, and Boruto makes a clone chain to reach her, but she has to reach back. Reaching for Boruto is enough to make her wake up in reality, where she struggles to move. Sarada disagrees with the investigating team wanting to withdraw to think of another strategy, despite there being no contact from Kiseru. She says that if they leave, Kiseru won't be able to contact them. Kawaki points out she's begging them to reconsider. Mitsuki grabs one of the communication devices, and Boruto's voice comes through. He says he's somewhere in the mountains. Sarada yells at him. Boruto looks down at everyone who woke up, determine to continue living. Rokuro is still in custody, Kiseru finds his friend. Batta gives Fugō a discount because his family is struggling. Shamo finds Boruto, asks about Yatsume, and gives him a letter he found addressed to him. It's from Ōga, telling him she found a dream, and tries to have him guess it, promising to visit him one day. Boruto teases Shamo telling him it's a letter from Ōga, and refusing to show him.\\n\"},\n",

He sends a messenger hawk, expending his search for intel on Code, returning to the Land of Redaku for the first time since Naruto was afflicted with an illness years prior. Kurama had shared with Naruto that the Sage of Six Paths suffered from the same illness. Looking through their records, they discovered the Sage recovered while visiting the Astronomy Research Institute in the Land of Redaku. Kakashi was sent to investigate, as the Land of Fire doesn't have diplomatic relations, but the situation is precarious, with the country suffering from famine, and their prime minister having taken power after the death of their king. He had become a tutor to Prince Nanara, using the opportunity to search through their records for more information. The prince couldn't read or write, so Kakashi had to teach him before tutoring him could lead to any intel. Sasuke decided to investigate on his own, Naruto too weak to stop him. He infiltrated the institute as a prisoner, the institute now functioning as a prison, to look for records of how the Sage recovered from the illness. Sasuke was introduced to his cell-mates, learning their names and sentences, and defended himself when other inmates attacked him. A couple guards try to discipline him, but director Zansūru points out everything Sasuke did was in self-defence. He advises Sasuke not to do anything too conspicuous. One of the inmates attempts to use the commotion to escape, but is killed by Menō. The prisoners watch as Menō devours the prisoner. The prisoners work while Menō patrols the area. In his cell at night, Sasuke refuses to gamble at first, thinking about Menō, but changes his mind, wanting a favour instead. He uses ninjutsu to win with dice, and wants Jiji to distract the guards if they patrol the area while he looks around. Jiji doesn't want to do it, but Sasuke leaves. He needs freedom to look for records on the Sage, and Menō is in the way. Sasuke thinks Menō is Zansūru's summon, but his permanence is unusual. Menō attacks Sasuke, immune to his genjutsu, who is forced to fight back. He is concerned with leaving evidence of a battle, but has to slash Menō's claws and torso. Menō flees. The next day, Sasuke is surprised to see Menō healed from every injury Sasuke gave him. Zansūru confronts Sasuke about attacking Menō. Sasuke attempts to use genjutsu, but Zansūru's artificial eye makes it ineffective on him. Zansūru warns him he'll increase surveillance. The prime minister wants Nanara to evacuate his village for military occupation, wishing to attack other countries to acquire land to deal with the famine, as they received no help over their lack of diplomatic relations. Kakashi infiltrates the library during the meeting, and discovers records about the Sage of Six Paths.\\n\"},\n",

Jiji and Penjira check on him. Jiji suggests Sasuke get himself checked in the infirmary, having learned of a new, attractive, and single doctor. Penjira accuses him of using Sasuke to see her again after being treated the previous day, Jiji admitting to it. Ganno refuses to join them, and reveals that Zansūru's office has a cellar, where he is rumoured to keep a secret. Zansūru and Menō check on the Menō Sasuke defeated, finding Sasuke to be troublesome, but confident that making more Menō can settle things. Sasuke sneaks out at night again, and combats Menō again. He wonders if this Menō was healed or if it's a different one, and begins to feel the effects of poison from a claw cut on his cheek. A doctor arrives just in time to pacify Menō, causing it give up attacking Sasuke and leave. Sasuke passes out, and when he wakes up in the infirmary, he learns that Sakura is the new doctor. She has come to update him on his mission, having received intel from Kakashi about the Sage of Six Paths' illness, detailing how he was cured from it with what became known as polar particles. He hid the rest of it, leaving behind clues on where and how to find it. She draws some of his blood, surprised the poison affected him. Sasuke wants her to return, respecting her strength, but finding himself capable enough, and suspicious of whatever Zansūru it up to with the beasts who were supposed to be extinct. She refuses to leave, but is happy that he's concerned for her. Sasuke finds Jiji eavesdropping on them, who claims he got permission to get himself treated for his blisters. He heard that Sasuke and Sakura are married. Sakura claims she came to work there to see Sasuke, as visitors aren't allowed. On their way back to their cell, Sasuke asks Jiji not to tell anyone he's married to Sakura, and Jiji reveals he has a fiancée himself in the Redaku capital. Jiji is appalled to learn Sasuke and Sakura are apart for years at times, and advises him to get Sakura a ring. Sasuke asks if Jiji knows anything about astronomical documents, and he advises Sasuke to ask Penjira, who is a librarian. Sakura asks Penjira about it when he's gambling during lunch break. He checks that the books are in a restricted basement, which would require Zansūru's permission to check out. Sakura wants to gamble with him for the key, promising to smuggle him as many cigarettes as he wants if he wins. He introduces her to Hoshinarabe, and she picks it up quickly, beating him. He accuses her of cheating, but lends her to key anyway. At night, she explains to Sasuke she memorised the unique wear and damage of each card, something she began doing to always draw when playing with Tsunade, boring her into stop playing. She asks him about Jiji, who often visits her and talks about his fiancée. Recalling Jiji's words, he asks her about how she feels about them spending so much time apart. She is flustered, but answers she isn't worried, even if she misses him sometimes. He makes her a wedding ring and asks her to wear it. They find the book, which contains ink paintings related to the Hoshinarabe cards. They paintings depict constellations. Sasuke recognises some of the constellations as Tailed Beasts, and they deduce the two remaining paintings depict Janmāru-Tataru and the Sage of Six Paths himself. They wonder where they could look for more information, and Sasuke mentions the rumour about Zansūru's basement. Someone eavesdropping on them leaves. Sakura mentions that a messenger from the capital will meet with Zansūru the next day, which could give them an opportunity to investigate. She wants to impersonate the messenger, allowing Sasuke to look around.\\n\"},\n",

Jiji explains that despite not eating almonds, he always sees Menō under the almond tree, deducing it likes the scent. Ganno pets Menō, and encouraged by his success, Penjira tries it as well. However, his foot goes slightly outside their cell, agitating Menō over a rule being broken. The commotion causes hot oil from the lantern to spill and burn Menō, who runs away. Jiji smooths things over when a guard checks on them. The next day, Sakura greets messenger Fundaru. She learns that Fundaru himself doesn't know the specifics of what the Prime Minister wants with Zansūru, only that he must inquire about a certain progress. After getting details of whether Fundaru and Zansūru met before, and when Zansūru last visited the palace, she gets him to Sasuke, who knocks Fundaru out with his Sharingan. They go over their plan, and Sakura explains a vulnerability she learned about Zansūru's artificial eye, that it has a narrow field of vision at high angles. Sakura transforms into Fundaru and goes to meet Zansūru. She distracts him by making him go to the window, and tosses Fundaru's cane across the room, actually a transformed Sasuke. Zansūru asks about the missing cane, and Sakura produces another one, hidden beneath Fundaru's cloak. Sakura stalls for Sasuke to have enough time to map the keyhole with chakra and make a key with Earth Release. Zansūru asks what the Prime Minister wants, and Sakura asks about the progress. Zansūru answers that he already intends to send the assets to the capital, but refuses to elaborate on the numbers. Sasuke manages to get down to the cellar. He goes through another door, and is surprised to find a number of chickens and fossils. Sakura leaves the meeting with Zansūru, and Sasuke discovers the room has an exit to behind the main building. From an altar present in the room, Sasuke believes Zansūru is resurrecting the fossils with Impure World Reincarnation. Menō attacks Sasuke, who notices the burn from the previous night hasn't healed. While dodging its attacks, Sasuke notes it doesn't have a tag embedded into it, despite clearing acting on Zansūru's orders, and adjust his premise, still believing it to be reincarnation ninjutsu. He stops Menō from attacking with a sheathed sword, and through a shadow clone, applies supercooled water to his burn. Sasuke lets Menō bite him, and convinces it to let him help Menō go back to where it was before being brought back. Reaching inside and grabbing Menō's tongue, Sasuke flows his chakra to overwrite genjutsu control over it. Now affectionate, it obeys Sasuke. At the altar, someone resurrects more fossils for Zansūru, who wants to have an army of dragon beasts.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"A messenger hawk delivers an update from Kakashi to Sakura by sunset, informing her that the Prime Minister has taken military action in Princess Manari's name. She recalls Zansūru's words of sending assets to the capital, wonders where he could be keeping them, and goes to search for Sasuke. She doesn't find him in the lunch hall, and reviews what they don't know yet. Ganno sits to eat next to her, and notices her wedding ring. He asks about her husband, and surprises her when he mentions Sasuke by name, explaining he overheard Sasuke and Jiji talking about it. He adds that before Sakura arrived, Sasuke would spend time watching the flowers outside, and leaves. She checks outside, and sees a blooming almond tree, whose flowers resemble cherry blossoms. Thinking about the paintings, constellations, and zodiacs, she realises those are connected to hand seals. Sasuke and Jiji work sorting out inedible apricots, Jiji telling him a prisoner died of unknown causes after eating one. Sasuke spots a lake on the distance, and Jiji explains it's supposedly a meteor crater that filled with rainwater. There are no fish, and during the day, its shade of blue makes it look like the sky fell to the earth. Sasuke realises something and leaves, telling Jiji he'll take his next kitchen duty. Sasuke and Sakura meet at her office. She explains how the hands in Hoshinarabe are the hand seals required to reveal the polar particles, and he explains he discovered where the sky that fell to earth is, asking her to accompany him at night. Sasuke leaves his cell at night, which Jiji notices. Sakura is concerned about Menō, but he assures it's fine. He holds her when she trips jumping down her office window. He takes her to the lake, reflecting the starry night sky. They hold hands, and he asks her if she wants a proper wedding ring, as a reminder of their marriage when they're apart. Sakura says she thought about it, but she'd have to take it off for work. He doesn't usually worry, but it gets to him when he sees Sarada has grown taller, or Sakura has changed her hair style. Sakura feels the same when she notices faint wrinkles on him when he laughs. She performs the hand seals, and a pillar of light emerges from the lake. Sakura walks up to it and collects the sealed polar particles, causing the pillar to dissipate. She stores them, and an explosion goes off at the institute. They notice several flying dragon beasts take off, and wonder if those are the assets Zansūru mentioned. Sasuke wants to capture one, and instructs Sakura to capture Zansūru at the institute. She leaves for the institute, and Zansūru lands on a dragon beast. He thanks Sasuke for recovering the polar particles. Sasuke realises he had used the inmate to excavate the fossils, the chickens as vessels, and the apricots which had absorbed the particles' energy to resurrect the dragon beasts. Their uncovering of the particles allowed him to revive a large number of beasts at once. Zansūru claims to be acting on behalf of the nation, and Sasuke warns that using kinjutsu as such will carry consequences. Zansūru doesn't know about Impure World Reincarnation when Sasuke mentions it. When Sasuke asks if he intends to support the Prime Minister, Zansūru realises he has an ally near Prince Nanara. Noticing his true loyalty to the minister, Sasuke finds it unlikely that Zansūru would release the jutsu. He is surprised to see with his Sharingan that Zansūru has too little chakra to be a shinobi, so someone else brought back and is controlling the beasts. At the institute, several beasts continue to appear and attack the inmates. Penjira is almost killed by one, and is saved by Sakura, who punches open a whole through the institutes walls, allowing the inmates to flee, as well as punching one of the beasts nearby. She goes looking for Zansūru, but he's not there. Instead, she finds inmates hiding inside, and tells them of the exit she created. Jiji asks her what happened, and she tells him Zansūru is responsible. He claims he saw Zansūru in the courtyard earlier, but she came from there and didn't see him. He hugs her close and stabs her with a poisoned kunai, which she recognises as the one Sasuke was poisoned with by Menō. Jiji is working with Zansūru, and allowed her to move freely so they could find the polar particles. He gets the particles from her. She tries to stop him, and he confesses he really did appreciate her, who reminds him of his girlfriend Margo, so she's sad she has to die, and leaves. He wants to use the particles to resurrect Margo, and uses the reincarnation ninjutsu. The entire institute begins to crumble as the ground shifts, and an excited Zansūru leaves Sasuke fighting the flying beasts. A gigantic beasts emerges from where the institute used to be. Sakura is paralysed as debris falls around her.\\n\"},\n",

       "   'episode synopsis text': \"Sasuke fights his way back to the institute against the flying dinosaurs with Menō's help. He notices the Titan's emergence, and recalling that Zansūru brought up Sasuke having an ally, Sasuke realises Jiji is Zansūru's accomplice, the only other person who knew he wasn't working alone. Zansūru thinks the Prime Minister will be pleased by the assets. Sasuke has Menō evacuate the prisoners while he goes after Sakura. He grows agitated when he can't sense her chakra. Sakura wakes up pinned, can't mould chakra because of the poison, and passes out. She wakes up to Sasuke tending her wound. She apologises for not stopping Jiji, but he tells her not to worry. She prepared a serum against the poison beforehand. Zansūru joins up with Jiji, who hands him the polar particles. Zansūru wants to kill all the inmates before joining the minister to suppress Nanara's rebellion. Jiji tells him not to renege on his promise. Zansūru has Jiji target Ganno, but Menō stops the dinosaur attacking him. They're surprised by it, and deduce Sasuke took control of Menō. Sasuke and Sakura arrive, so Zansūru changes the dinosaur's focus to them. Sakura breaks the ground around the dinosaurs. Zansūru sends Jiji after her. Sasuke makes the flying dinosaurs crash against each other with Chidori Senbon. Menō climbs the Titan to attack Zansūru, who narrowly escapes, being picked up by a flying dinosaur. Sasuke continues attacking the dinosaurs with his sword, Fire Release, and Chidori. Sasuke receives a message by a hawk, and shares that the minister has been imprisoned by king Nanara. Zansūru decides to keep fighting in the minister's name, as he can still grow his dinosaur army while in possession of the polar particles. Sakura helps more prisoners evacuate, but is chased by Jiji. He blocks her escape with an Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall. Sakura becomes paralysed as a side effect of the serum, but Jiji gets likewise caught in a trap she lured him into. Sasuke lures the Titan into the lake, where it struggles to move. Sasuke switches places with a flying dinosaur, getting close to Zansūru, who commands the one carrying him to flee. It drops him instead, crashing down into the ground, dead. Sasuke switches with another dinosaur on the ground. Zansūru commanding the dinosaurs despite not being in control of them meant new orders replaced the old ones. Sasuke retrieves the polar particles, and he and Menō get back to Sasuke. He asks what Jiji's goal was. Sakura releases her trap, and Sasuke intends to hand Jiji over to the Land of Redaku. Jiji reveals he was a missing-nin from Suna, and joined the minister when asked to create a private army. He fell in love with his attendant Margo, turning away from war. However, while he was in a mission, Margo died in an epidemic, and he was approached with an offer. If he revived the dinosaurs, the country would release her corpse from him to resurrect. Sakura admits she might try the same in his situation, but her friends would stop her, and she doesn't believe their deceased loved ones would approve. Sasuke reveals Jiji was deceived, as Margo is mentioned as cooperating with king Nanara. Jiji cries in joy and relief, and releases the reincarnation ninjutsu, all the dinosaurs turning into dust. Sasuke bids Menō farewell. One of the dinosaurs attacks Sakura as it disappears, but Jiji protects her, getting bitten. Sakura tries healing him, feeling he has to go see Margo, but he doesn't think he deserves it. Later, Naruto has recovered in Konoha, and asks about how Redaku is doing to Kakashi. He updates him that Nanara is officially king now. Sakura catches up with Ino, who notes her ring. Sakura recalls how Sasuke found her in the debris because of the ring. Nanara visits the ruins of the institute, and intends to rebuild it with Margo and Jiji's help. Still away in a mission, Sasuke and Sakura both miss each other, but are not worried.\\n\"},\n",

Considering her an enemy as she's with Code, Delta prepares to kick her with her free leg, but stops before hitting Ada. Ada points out Delta is flashing her. She obeys Ada as she commands her to release Code, shocking Shikamaru. He asks Delta what's happening, but she has no idea. Shikamaru asks Ino for backup. Sasuke apologises to Boruto for failing to keep his promise when Momoshiki took him over, which forced Kawaki to take on that role. Sasuke explains only a few people know Kawaki killed him, which he considers fortunate as many already disapprove of Kawaki. Boruto thinks they shouldn't hate Kawaki as he asked for it, but Sasuke counters that whoever kills him will be hated. Boruto says he could only have asked Kawaki, and Kawaki was only able to do it because they're brothers. Boruto thanks Sasuke for his forehead protector, which helped firm his resolve and attempts to return it. Since it helped, Sasuke gifts it to him, even if Boruto thinks it's precious memento between Sasuke and Naruto. Boruto puts it on, elated. Sasuke is concerned he'll be the next to have to show resolve. Sarada and Mitsuki watch from afar, wondering what they're talking about. They think Boruto could have died, and Mitsuki gets chills thinking of being absent when Boruto needed help, and wonders what he'd do if someone tried to kill him. Sarada feels a mix of shock, relief, and anger over what happened. She doesn't blame Boruto, but wonders if they're so undependable. Mitsuki asks if Sarada likes Boruto, catching her off guard, and she says her wanting to do more for him is independent on the presence or absence of feelings. She points out Mitsuki's eyes light up when it comes to Boruto, and complains that Sasuke is her father first before being Boruto's teacher. Mitsuki says they need to get stronger to face the Ōtsutsuki, and she adds she also needs it to be Hokage. Kawaki wakes up in a room with Sumire and Naruto, who comments it reminds him of the first time they met. He asks Naruto if he came to talk about old memories, and Naruto asks Sumire to have her leave the room. Before she leaves, he asks Naruto if he condemns him for killing Boruto, shocking her. Naruto reveals Boruto is alive thanks to the Kāma. Naruto is thankful he was there, otherwise they might all be dead, and adds that Boruto feels the same. As Naruto assures Kawaki he belongs in Konoha, Ino contacts him and Sasuke, reporting Code and Ada's invasion. Sasuke tells Boruto of the attack, and the two move out. Naruto claims to have forgotten an urgent matter, and confirms to Sumire that Boruto is fine. Kawaki focuses on his Kāma, manifesting Isshiki's dōjutsu. Shikamaru paralyses Ada, who is surprised he can take action against her, reasoning it's possible because his attack inflicts no harm. Shikamaru notices they're all experiencing consequences of Ada's ability, and asks Ino to connect with him Amado, which she does. He informs Amado of their communication, and warns him not to give it away, before asking about Ada and her ability. Amado informs him they're all Ada's captives, having been enchanted by her, that Ada herself has no control over it, and the effect lasts until she dies. Delta is infatuated with her. Shikamaru wants to kill her, but Amado says it's futile. She tells him to relax, and he struggles to maintain his jutsu, his will impressing her. Amado warns him that resistance might damage his mind. He drops his kunai and releases his jutsu. Shikamaru thinks of the danger if Naruto and Sasuke were to come into the room. Code begins torturing Amado. Shikamaru asks Ada her motive, if she has a grudge against Konoha. She answers Code's reasons are personal to him, and admits she's helping him because she likes Kawaki. In exchange for helping restore his power, he'll help her with Kawaki. Shikamaru asks Ino to change to access codes to the room, and stall the backups he requested. Ada thinks Shikamaru finds her foolish, but he says he's just surprise, and makes a proposition to her. If she comes over to Konoha, they can help each other, and she can tell Kawaki how she feels. Code is shocked by it.\\n\"},\n",

Sumire and Amado are done with his check-up. Kawaki complains that Code is still after him, even though he's no longer a vessel. Amado corrects him, pointing out that while Isshiki's soul has vanished and can no longer possess him, the Ōtsutsuki changes to his body remain. Kawaki gets hostile with Amado, until he points out that Kawaki needs more power to protect Naruto from Code. Amado thinks Naruto would die against Code now that he has lost Kurama, and suggests Kawaki get a new Kāma that acts only as a weapon now that Isshiki's soul is gone. Kawaki hates the Kāma, but Amado finds him rational enough to grasp for any available power to achieve his goals. He reminds Kawaki that they're both outsiders, who will be tossed out when they're no longer useful. Ada finds Kawaki's situation too painful to watch. Code refuses to spare Naruto in addition to Kawaki when Ada asks for it. Ada bosses Bug around, who reminds them there are still many armed guards in the facility. He points out they'll get nothing done if they stay there, secretly wishing for them to leave him behind. Ada is in no rush to act, as the five villages are looking for Code. She is confident she can spot an opportunity with her Senrigan when it presents itself and seize it. Code wishes he could remove his limiters, and thinks that he and Ada could take on Naruto and Sasuke. Ada says her combat abilities are low. She'll be Code's eyes and ears, while he'll be her knight. He asks her what she'll do if Kawaki attacks her, pointing that being immune to her entrancing, he and Boruto are capable of taking action against her. She invites Code to meet her other knight. Team 10 spot Kawaki walking around with a grim expression, thinking back to Amado's words. Shikadai takes him aside when he starts drawing attention. They try to assure him of his place in Konoha. Himawari is training for an upcoming test. Boruto asks her, but she hasn't seen Kawaki. She asks him to spar with her. He refuses, concerned that the Kāma will act up. Sumire asks Amado about his offer to Kawaki. He explains the situation comparing Isshiki, Kawaki, and the Kāma to a homeowner, house, and doorway. Sumire suspects Amado has an ulterior motive for wishing to restore Kawaki's Kāma, something else he wants Kawaki to do. Amado admits it's a personal matter he's unwilling to share with her, as it doesn't concern her. He assures her he has no intention of harming Konoha. Sumire sees a container next do him. Code asks Ada about her other knight, who tells him he's the only person other than an Ōtsutsuki who can kill her. Bug protests against waking that person up, but follows through. Daemon immediately jumps on top of Code, and Ada warns him not to attack her younger brother. Daemon teases Code. The armed guards arrive, and Bug warns them to stay away, or they'll be killed. The guards attacks backfire on them, and Daemon begins attack them himself. Ada confirms to Code that Daemon can reflect killing intent as tangible effects. Daemon kills the remaining guards. Code attempts to mark Daemon, but his ability activates regardless of his intent, reflecting the Claw Marks. Code demonstrates his ability to Daemon. He asks Daemon about his ability, and Ada has to stop Daemon from explaining too much. Code wonders if Ada herself is keeping yet another ability hidden. Hinata asks Boruto about Kawaki, but he's still out. Shikamaru and Shikadai discuss Kawaki while playing shogi. Naruto finds Kawaki at the Hokage Rock. Kawaki feels like an outsider, so Naruto takes him back home for a welcome dinner. Boruto gifts Kawaki his forehead protector after breaking his original one. Kawaki says Boruto won't have one, but Boruto points out he has Sasuke's. After dinner, Himawari confides in Kawaki that she thinks Boruto is worried about something, as he started training a lot. She feels she can't help Boruto yet, and asks Kawaki to do it if he goes overboard. Kawaki says he will. Kawaki remains concerned despite Naruto's assurances that he belongs, and that they'll do something about Code. He doesn't think he needs a Kāma, and finds there's still something he can do to protect Konoha and Naruto.\\n\"},\n",

Kawaki notes Inojin's mention of the sensory team being able to locate any potential enemy unless they're able to erase their chakra signature. Amado joins Shikamaru, and tries to assure him that Code, while powerful, isn't as bright. Shikamaru is still suspicious of Amado, thinking that events are unfolding according to some plan. Amado says most recent events have been unexpected, such as him defecting to Konoha, and most of all Kawaki's attachment to Naruto. Shikamaru wonders if it's possible that Code's devotion to Isshiki could have wavered, explaining his lack of action against them, but they find it unlikely. At night, Kawaki takes out the trash under Nishi's watch, going through a shrub on his way back. Boruto finds something strange when he returns. He feels a presence from outside, where the real Kawaki is hiding in the shrub. Nishi still senses Kawaki and Boruto inside. Ada reports to Code that Kawaki erased his chakra signature, something that comes naturally to all Ōtsutsuki, and wonders if he's up to something. Boruto tries talking to the Kawaki in the bathroom, feeling he's up to something. He tries telling Naruto about sensing Kawaki's presence outside, but Nishi reports sensing Kawaki still inside the house. Boruto believes Kawaki is using a shadow clone as a decoy, but Naruto points out those would still be sensed. Naruto asks to see Kawaki, who opens the door and releases the shadow clone. The real Kawaki goes outside the village, Ada informing Code about it. Code travels to a nearby Claw Mark, and speaks to Ada through another, asking her to guide him to Kawaki. Code reaches Kawaki, marking him and using the Claw Mark to close the distance. Ino connects Naruto and Shikamaru, who discuss why Kawaki would leave when he was acclimating well to the village. Naruto tells Ino Kawaki erased his chakra signature, and Boruto tells him he can no longer sense Kawaki, finding he's too far away. Naruto wants Boruto to leave it to them, but Boruto leaves while they're distracted. Amado asks how they could have lost Kawaki, and Shikamaru says he ran away on his own, speculating on his motive. Boruto goes in the direction he last sensed Kawaki, hoping that the sensors will track him while he tracks Kawaki. Kawaki and Code fight, Ada warning Code not to accidentally kill him. Code diverts a blast from Kawaki with a Claw Mark. Code asks why he left the village, and Kawaki wants Code to kill just him as revenge for Isshiki, leaving Konoha out of it. Code refuses it and beats Kawaki around, despite Ada's protests. Code reveals he has inherited Isshiki's will to cultivate a God Tree and eat its chakra fruit. He surprises Kawaki by saying he's off his revenge list because someone else wants to meet him, and prepares to take Kawaki with him. Boruto arrives just in time to interfere. Ada informs Code that Boruto could still sense Kawaki and went after him. Boruto and Kawaki scold each other for getting themselves in danger. Boruto says they'll sense him and send reinforcements, but Kawaki thinks that defeats the point of what he did, willing to die himself to protect Naruto. He wants Code to take him to whoever wants to meet him, since talking to Code is getting him nowhere. Ada is flustered about Kawaki wanting to meet her. Boruto and Kawaki argue over what's happening, and Boruto punches him when he says what Naruto wants and thinks doesn't matter to what Kawaki does to keep him safe. Ada also gets flustered by Boruto's commitment to Kawaki, calling him a brother. Boruto activates his Kāma.\\n\"},\n",

Code is curious by how Momoshiki's consciousness can emerge while Boruto remains only a vessel. They are surprised to notice Boruto is still in control as he cautions Kawaki to stay back. Boruto attacks with shadow clones, and Code notices his increased strength. He places a mark on Boruto and uses it to avoid attacks and launch his own at the clones. Boruto manages to pull Code through his mark with the help of a clone and lands a punch. Code puts distance between them, and Kawaki wonders how Boruto is in control and stronger than before. Code consults Ada, who while unsure of what's happening in Boruto's body, speculates it might be due to Amado's drugs, and warns him not to underestimate Boruto. Naruto instructs Ino to look for Boruto's chakra instead of Kawaki's. Shikamaru arrives, concerned that the enemy might be where they are as well, and clarifies he'll be going with Naruto, as he no longer has Kurama's power. He further justifies it with Sasuke still being away tracking Code, and Sai being busy guarding Amado. Hinata wants to join them, but Naruto wants her to stay with Himawari with Shikamaru agree asking Hinata not to be insistant on going. Himawari asks Naruto to come home safe with Boruto and Kawaki. Naruto reassures her while entering Sage Mode. Boruto attempts to absorb Code's marks in vain. Kawaki explains that while they're mostly chakra based, there's enough iron from Code's blood in them to make them physical matter that Kāma can't absorb. He asks Boruto about Momoshiki, who also speculates Amado's medicine might be responsible for him not emerging. Boruto wants to focus on taking Code down. Code comments that regardless of medicine, they can't get rid of Momoshiki, and that whoever he is, he's still an Ōtsutsuki, and as a quality sacrifice, should produce a fine God Tree. Boruto notices Code's knowledge of Amado's drugs. Code decides to grab Boruto when his maturation is almost complete, and moves through his marks to grab Kawaki for Ada. Kawaki attacks Code with a shadow clone, forcing him to move through a mark to escape Boruto's Rasengan. Code comments on Kawaki's change of heart, who explains all he does is for Naruto, Boruto adding that taking him down now would be the most expedient thing to do. He and Code exchange insults. Naruto in Sage Mode finds Boruto and an unidentified chakra, and coordinates with Ino. Naruto and Shikamaru move out, Naruto leaving behind two shadow clones gathering natural energy. He assuages Shikamaru's concern about the duration of Sage Mode, and Shikamaru in turn asks him not to overdo it. Code and Boruto fight, with Code narrowly avoiding Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan.

Momoshiki states Code is next, and resumes attacking, pressuring him. Ada contacts Code, warning him Momoshiki is too strong. Code immobilises Kawaki, using him as shield against Momoshiki, who needs an Ōtsutsuki to sacrifice for a chakra fruit. Momoshiki changes his Rasengan into a ranged, precision attack, separating Code from Kawaki, who he grabs. Kawaki attempts to fight Momoshiki, but is overwhelmed. Shikamaru arrives, pinning Momoshiki with his shadow, allowing Naruto to save Kawaki. Ada wonders how Code will retrieve Kawaki now. Kawaki is distressed about Naruto putting himself in danger. Shikamaru attempts to constrict Momoshiki with his shadow, but he's too strong. Code holds Shikamaru hostage, and tells Momoshiki this is an opportunity for him to take revenge on Naruto. Momoshiki revels in the opportunity for making the son kill his father. Kawaki fails to stop Momoshiki, who aims an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan at them. Thinking on his wish for power to protect Naruto, Kawaki absorbs it, manifesting a new Kāma, to everyone's surprise.

Ada warns him against considering sacrificing Kawaki in Boruto\\'s place for the God Tree. Code threatens to kill Shikamaru if Kawaki approaches. Kawaki is indifferent, so Code releases Shikamaru and tries to escape. Kawaki stops him by shrinking his Claw Marks so Code can\\'t use them. Kawaki mocks Code, pointing out that killing Boruto should make it clear the lengths he\\'ll go through to protect Naruto. He goes on the offensive and pressures Code. Shikamaru goes to check on Naruto, still in disbelief and denial of what happened, and stresses that the battle still isn\\'t over. Kawaki tells Code that if the person who wants to meet him is also against Naruto, he won\\'t show them any mercy either, and blasts him point blank. Kawaki is knocked out, Code having pulled Daemon through the Claw Mark on his head to reflect the attack. Ada is angry that Code involved Daemon without her permission, and he apologises for waking him up. Daemon wants to fight, but Code sends him back to Ada. She warns him he\\'s been doing whatever he wants a lot, and stresses that Kawaki better be ok. Code tells her she can see Kawaki herself, and she assures him that had Kawaki died, she\\'d send Daemon to kill him. Code begrudgingly admits he\\'s not strong enough to overcome Kawaki at the moment. Shikamaru tries pinning him when he moves to collect Kawaki, and says reinforcements are on the way. Code thinks it\\'s a bluff, but is unwilling to risk it when Shikamaru points out that fighting Kawaki exhausted him. Code leaves, wanting Shikamaru to inform Amado he\\'ll use him to have his limiters removed. Shikamaru asks Naruto what precautions should be taken with Kawaki, considering the extremes he\\'ll go to protect Naruto. Naruto refuses to blame Kawaki. Shikamaru struggles to believe Naruto doesn\\'t blame Kawaki for Boruto\\'s death. Boruto moves and asks who\\'s dead, to their shock. Naruto cries in joy and hugs him. Boruto has new markings on his torso, and Momoshiki communicates with him. Momoshiki explains that as his vessel, Boruto is the anchor of his soul, and his death would extinguish him like Isshiki. He reveals he had to use the still unextracted portion of his Kāma to reconstruct the destroyed portions of Boruto\\'s body. Because of that, Momoshiki can no longer resurrect through Kāma. Boruto believes this means he wins, but Momoshiki points out that the full extraction of Kāma means he\\'s fully Ōtsutsuki now, so he can be sacrificed to grow a God Tree, something Code will realise soon. Momoshiki adds that Boruto won\\'t be revived like that again, and Boruto points out he was wrong before, recalling his previous warnings. Momoshiki laughs, saying the two matters are unrelated, eagerly waiting for it to play out. Boruto explains the nature of his resurrection to Naruto and Shikamaru. Ada notifies Code of these developments. She reminds Code of the terms of their deal, and warns that if he remains useless after his limiters are removed, or if she determines him to be a nuisance, she\\'ll have no qualms disposing of him. He assures her that he has already taken measures. Kawaki wakes up in the hospital, Sumire taking care of him. He wonders why he\\'s not imprisoned for killing Boruto, and Sumire reveals he\\'s fine. Kawaki comments on Amado having restored his Kāma, and admits that for the first time he was glad to have it, needing it as otherwise Naruto would be dead. Boruto and Kawaki later talk at the Hokage Rock, discussing what \"everything\" means to each of them.
